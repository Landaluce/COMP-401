10Technology is changing at a rapid pace. However, many people 
don™t have access to the digital world due to gaps in education, 

skills, and ˜nancial resources. Capital One is dedicated to 

providing opportunities and resources that will enable more 

people to succeed in an ever-changing digital economy. In 
2015, Capital One launched Future Edge
SM, a ˜ve-year 
program to invest $150 million in community grants 

and initiatives to help people develop digital skills for 
 the jobs of today and tomorrow. 
At Capital One, we believe that our businesses can be 
successful only when our communities are healthy and 

vibrant. We™re providing resources and education to help 

individuals, families, and business owners thrive today 

and in the future.
We Are Seizing the Opportunity
This is an electrifying time in human history. Years of hard work 

and bold decisions have put us in a strong position to capitalize 
 on opportunities as banking is transformed. Our businesses 
 and balance sheet are strong. We have a bold and iconic brand. 

We™re building a leading information-based technology company. 
Our customers are advocates. Our people are all-in. While much work 

remains, we™re on a mission to change banking for good and build one 
 of America™s great companies.

 BUILDING STRONG COMMUNITIES 
In 2015, Capital One launched 
Future Edge, an exciting and 
innovative program that helps 
prepare people for the jobs of 

tomorrow. College March, which 
promotes college access for all, 
and Capital One Coders, which 

teaches middle school students 
how to code, are two examples of 
how we bring Future Edge to life.
