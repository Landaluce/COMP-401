After several failed attempts, long-time 
trucker Frank Guzman resolved to start 

his own hauling business lae

thie fueled bancing and 

guidance from Wellargo. And that 

has made all therence. 
ﬁI™ve worked and driven for many 
companies in my life,ﬂ he said. ﬁBs 

clear that for me, being an owner-

operator is more rewarding.ﬂ 
Frank secured a Wellargo 
Equipment Express
® loan to help buy 

his rig. He also received guidance from 

small business bankers on managing 

his startup company™ances. The 

Houston-area entrepreneur then 

landed a client in the energy sector. 
ﬁIt™s the team approach that makes 
all of this work,ﬂ said Frank, whose 

ancée, Chrisy Guillory, is his business 

partner ananciaer. Frank 

credits Wellargo for helping him

help every step along thay,ﬂ he said. 
ﬁAll of this started when he came 
one day and spoke with our business

Chairman, President and Chief Executive 
O˜cer, Wells˚Fargo & Company 

Pictured in the Wells˚Fargo History Museum 

in San˚Francisco. 
                     To Our Owners,˚
I have always believed that culture is the most important 
part of a company™s success. It is the heart of any 

organization and a signicant contributor to long-term˚

performance and stability.
This is certainly true for 
Wellargo. Since 1852, culture 

has been a focus of ours, beginning˚

with how we served the Gold 

Rush-era customers who trusted 

us to transport their money and 

valuables on our stagecoaches. 

In those early days, we held a 

belief that still holds true today: 

ﬁOur merchandise is courtesy, 

willingness, and human ability.ﬂ˚
Today, I sum up Wellargo™s 
culture with this word: 

ﬁRelationships.ﬂ It captures the 

passion we all share for serving 

our key stakeholderustomers, 

communities, investors, and team 

members. To earn their trust, 

wve to do the right thing 

and act under the highest ethical 

standards where honesty, trust, 

and integrity matter.˚
Cultures take years to establish˚
and mature, a lesson I learned 

while growing up on a family 

farm in a small town in central 

Minnesota. Those years taught 

me that the best harvests come 

only after years of thoughtful 

planning, planting, and nurturing. 

It™s nerent at Wellargo. 

The culture our people enjoy 

today is the result of those who 

served beforough a 

civil war, two world wars, the 

Great Depression, and a Great 

Recession that remains fresh 
ur memories. Through every˚

boom and bust, our people 

looked ahead, with a vision of the 

Wellargo they wanted to leave 

for their successors.˚
No document better captures 
that spirit than 
The Vision & 

Values of Wells˚Fargo
, a booklet we˚

st publishears ago that 

outlines our values, strategies, and 

goals. (You can read our 
Vision & 

Values
 on wellsfargo.c
om under 
ﬁAbout Wellargo.ﬂ)˚
While we periodically have 
updated that document, the vision 

st shared years ago remains 

unchanged: ﬁWe want to satisfy all 

our customers™ ancial needs and˚

help them succancially.ﬂ˚
The 
reason
 our team members 
go to work each day is to help 

customere serve 7

customers and one in three U.S. 

households across our more than 

usinesses. The 
result
 is that 

Wellargo makes money, not 

the other way around. Or, as our 

Vision & Values
 puts it, ﬁWe™ll 

never put the stagecoach ahead 

of the horses.ﬂ This is why we 

believe culture and performance 

go hanand.˚
Financial res
ellargo generated 

record earnings for a sixth 

consecutive year, remaining 
the most prble bank in the 

Unites. We also ended 2014 

as the world™s most valuable bank 

by market capitalization.˚
Our 2014 net income was 
$2cent from 2013.˚

Diluted earnings per common share˚

also roscent to $4.10. Our 

2014 revas a˚

balanced mix of net interest income˚

and noninterest income, rg˚

the strength of our diver

business model.˚
We generated this growth 
through a focus on customers, 

aore of them entrusted us with 

their deposits and rewarded us 

with opportunities to serve more 

of thancial need

our total deposits reached a 

recorcent 

from the prior year, driven by 

both consumer and commercial 

growth. Meanwhile, total loans 

sh

cent from 2013. Loan 

growth occurred across multiple 

portfolios, including commercial 

loans, residential mortgages, 

credit cards, and automobile 

lending, helping increase our net 

interest income bcent from 

2013. Our noninterest income 

continued to be diverd 

strong, including growth in trust 

and investment fees, card fees, 

and mortgage servicing.˚
                         
    Our results also red our 
commitment to protect the interests 

of our stakeholders. For example, 

e credit quality of our loans 

was the best I can recall in mears˚

at the company. Credit losses fell to 

percent improvement˚

ovet charge-

s a percentage of average 

loans remained near historic low

compared with

Our capital also grew, remaining 
well above regulatory minimum levels.˚
At the end of 2014, our Common

resulting in a Common Equity T

BasGeneral Approach). Under 

BasAdvanced Approach, fully 

phased-in), our 2014 estimated

was 10.4cent.

to see strong returns. Full-year return 

on assets was 1.4cent, and full-

well within our target performance 

ranges. We returno

increased the quarterly dividend rate 
by 1cent tents per share, 

and we purchashares 

of our common stock on a net basis. 

During the year, shareholders also 

saw the price of our common stock 

riscent.˚
Because we believe culture 
uences performance, 

Wellargo counts among its 2014 

accomplishments some notable 

recognition: ﬁMost Respected 

Bankﬂ by 
Barron™s
 magazine, ﬁMost 

Admiredﬂ among the world™s largest 

banks by˚
Fortune
 magazine, ﬁBest 
U.S. Bankﬂ by 
The˚Banker
 magazine,˚

and ﬁMost Valuable Bank Brandﬂ 

by Brand Finance,® a global brand 

valuation company. However, just as 

we think about pre accolades 

would ring hollow if we didn™t believe 

they were the result of doing what™s 

right for our customers.˚
Customer
Our passion for helping customers 

motivates our team members. It 

grhen we hear how our 

banking anancial services improve˚

lives and transform businesses. For 

even as we increasingly serve tens of 

millions of customers through digital 

and mobile means, our business is 

still about people helping people.˚
Some call this a ﬁMain Streetﬂ focus.˚
We also call it helping individuals 

and businesses in the ﬁreal economy.ﬂ 

From checking accounts and 

debit cards to savings products to 

treasury management services, we 

help customers manage their daily 

ancial lives. We help families 

buy thst home or new car. We 

provide funding to businesses, small 

and large, to expand and hire. We 

help our customers plan and save for 

retirement. So convinced are we that 

this is Wellargo™s core purpose 

the began sharing stories 

of how we serve customers and 

communities through ﬁWellargo 

Stories,ﬂ a new online journal located 

at wellsfargo.com/stories
.˚One story that especially touched 
us involved Sam and Kerri Taylor of 
Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Before 

the recession, the family built a 

dream home. But when illness caused 

Kerri to cut back on her work, the 

family™s income fell, anancial 

challenges followed.˚
Fortunately, we were able to modify˚
the Taylors™ mortgae of more 

thmillion mortgage mations˚

we have completed sinc

telp them avoid foreclosure. 

Sadly, there are times when families 

simply can™ord to remain in their 

current home, but our mortgage 

servicing team works extremely hard 

to help our customerd solutions 

to sustain homeownership. Over 

the past six years, Wellargo has 

been able to work with families like 

the Taylors to forgive more than 

ortgage principal.˚
ﬁAll I can say is WOW,ﬂ Sam 
Taylor told us. ﬁAngela [Ludwig, 

a Wellargo Home Mortgage 

specialist] not only helped us get 

approved for the mation and 

keep our home, she displayed the 

most professional and courteous 

attitude I™ve ever seen.ﬂ˚
We also hear ﬁwowsﬂ from our 
business customer

Wellargo exten

in new loan commitments to small 

businesses. Additionally, for the 

12th consecutive year, we were the 

nation™s largest small business lender 

in dollars, based on Community 

Reinvestment Act government 

data (ata will be 

released later in 2015). Last year, we 

also launched Wellargo Works 

fmall Business,
SM a broad initiative 
to deliver resources, guidance, 

and services to small businesses, 

including a goal to extenbillion˚

in new loans by the end of 2018.˚
We™re proud to lend to entrepreneurs˚
like David Dorrough of Boise, Idaho. 

Our relationship with David began 

not long after he became frustrated 

with the quality of commercially 

availaders when installing 

bookshelves at his home. David 

put his electrical engineering skills 

to work to create a more accurate 
                              
  der, and Franklin Sensors 
was born. Working out of his home 

and paying out-of-pocket to build 

inventory weranciallult for 

David™s small startup company. Enter 

Wellargo banker Flier, 

who helped David with a Small 

Business Administration revolving 

line of credit. Five years later, David™s 

company employs 4s 

community and sells its products in 

the U.S. and overseas.˚
Sometimes the small businesses 
we serve become larger companies. 

Consider Vermeer Corporation, a 

66-year-old agricultural and industrial˚

equipment company based in Iowa 

that started with a single product. 

Wellargo Commercial Banking 

Relationship Manager Mark Conway 

has worked with Vermeer for 2ears,˚

helping this family-owned business 

as it has grown into a global business 

that now makmodels of various 

products and employs 3,000 people 

(sa).˚
Our Wholesale Banking business 
helps companies like Vermeer with 

their global neede operate 

oough services 

such as foreign exchange, treasury 

management, asset-based lending, and˚

investment banking. We have grown 

our Wholesale Banking business as our˚

customers™ needs have increased. We 

are the Noder to middle-market 

companies, the largest commercial 

real estate lender, and one of the top 

providers of syndicated loans.˚
Team member
Our biggest competitive advantage 

is our team. This is why we refer to 

our people as ﬁteam members,ﬂ not 

ﬁemployees.ﬂ We believe our 265,000 

team members are resources to 

be invested in, not expenses to be 

managed. Wer competitive salaries˚

and beno ensure we attract and˚

retain the best talent. For eligible team˚

members, this inclordable 

healthcare options, 401(k) matching 

contributions, tuition reimbursements,˚

matches for education-related 

charitable donations, adoption 
Our passion for helping customers motivates our 
team members. Itˆgratiˇes us when we hear how our 

banking and ˇnancial services improve lives and 

transform businesses. 
reimbursements, work-life balance 
programs, scholarship programs 

for team members™ children, and a 

discretionary prharing plan. 

We also train and develop our talent. 

Last year, Wellargo team members 

completed more than 7

training courses. On the stagecoach, 

we build careers.˚
Each year we survey our team 
members to understand what engages˚

them at work. The more engaged 

our team members are, the more 

connected they are to our culture and˚

our vision and valverall 

team member engagement measured˚

4.22 out of a possible 5, topping the 

prior year™s record of 4.16. WellFargo˚

is a ﬁGallup Great Workplace Awardﬂ 

winner, a distinction that the Gallup 

organization, which conducts our 

survey, reserves for the world™s most 

engaged and productive companies.˚
Our people also value teamwork. 
They expect to work together 

across our businessOne 

Wellars we help customers 

achievancial success. Or, to 

quote our 
Vision & Values
: ﬁOur 

relationships with our customers are 

only as strong as our relationships 

with each other.ﬂ˚
This is why I like to say that our 
culture is about plural pronoun

wed ourstead of I, me, 

and mine. The star of the team 
is the 

team, because how the work gets 

done is just as important as getting 

the work done.˚
Team members like Keith Shealy set˚
the example. A Wellarancial 

advisor in South Carolina, Keith 

recently advised a customer who 

owns a 60-year-old family business. 

Keith understood the customer had 

commercial banking needs, so he 

enlisted the help of Mike Farmer, a 
banker from our Wholesale Banking 

business. Keith also tapped Wendy 

Brewer in Wealth Management for 

help because the customer wanted 

guidance in succession planning for 

his family and company co-owners.˚
Without such teamwork, our 
customer might have had to deal 

with multiancial services 

companies for his personal and 

commercial needs. That would have 

been unfortunate for him and a 

missed opportunity for us. Indeed, 

it™s only through such teamwork that 

we can hope to live up to a key goal 

expressed in our 
Vision & Values
: 
ﬁWe want to be thst provider our 

customers think of when they need 

their neancial product.ﬂ˚
C
In addition to serving customers, 

our team members serve the 

communities where they live and 

wellargo team 

members contributed $97

of their own money to schools, 

charities, religious organizations, 

and other nonprat™s up 

nearlcent from 2013 and 

marks the 12th consecutive year-

over-year increase in team member 

donations. Unitay Worldwide 

has recognized Wellargo for 

having the nation™s Nonited Way 

campaign for six consecutive years 

(ccomplishment 

I am especially proud of because 

Wellargo ranked 29th on the 2014 

Fortune 500 list of America™s largest 

corporations.˚
Team members also volunteer

  Our team members understand 
thorts can add up in big ways, 

which is why we say the spirit of our 

philanthropy and volunteerism is 

summed up best by a ﬁSmall is Hugeﬂ 

mindset that believes no opportunity 

is too small to makerence in an 

individual™s or community™s future.˚
Wellargo also strives to be 
a responsible corporate citizen. 

ellargo contributed

Earlier I mentioned the work we 
do to help people keep their homes. 

We also help low- to moderate-

income households buy homes in 

many ways, but I am especially 

proud of our 
LIFT
 programs. These 

programs provide education and 

down payment assistance to potential 

homebuyers in communities that the

Additionally, we are making

Staying grounded, moving ahea
As a company sets its sights on the 

future, the right culture is essential. 

It keeps its team members connected 

to the company™s reason for being. 

Aellargo, we strike that balance 

by focusing on six strategic priorities 

we believe we must master each 

day we board the stagecoach. These 

priorities receive our attention 

because they allow us to devote talent 

and resources torts focused on 

our future, initiatives that we believe 

are vital to continuing the success 

we™ve enjoyed in thancial 

crisis era.˚
Our six day-to-day strategic 
priorities are:˚
Putting customer
usiness is built around an 
unwavering focus on customers. 

Our people provide products and 

services to meet customer needs 

through multiple, convenient ways 

that add up to high-quality, caring 

relationships and guidance.˚
Growing revenue.
 Revenue is the 

grade our customers give us each 

day when they reward us with 

their business. When we serve 

customers well, the money we earn 

is the result. We generate revenue 

from more than 90 businesses, 

which provide diverse sources of 

income through economic cycles.˚
Managing expenses.
 We focus on 

operatinly by thoughtfully˚

managing our resources and 

exercising discipline to invest in 

the areas that matter most to our 

customers and stakeholder

ocy ratio (how much 

expense we incur for every dollar of˚

revenue we earn) wapercent for˚

the full year, within our target range˚

of 55 tcent, and industry-

leading among our large bank peers.˚
Living our vision and val

We seek to bring our vision and 

values to life in all that we do, 

demonstrating who we are through 

our actions.˚
Connecting with communities 

and stakeholders.
 We believe 

there™s a connection between our 

success and the success of our 

key stakeholderustomers, 

communities, investors, and team 

members. These are relationships 

we nurture each day.˚
Managing risk.
 Strong risk 

management has been a 

cornerstone of our long-term 

success, so we continue to invest 

antly in this area.˚
With these priorities well understood,˚

we are able to devote additional talents˚

and resources to four areas that we 

believe are critical to Wellargo™s 

future: creating exceptional customer 

experiences, digitizing the enterprise, 

making diversity and inclusion part 

of our DNA, and leading the way in 

risk and operational excellence.˚
             
  
         
        
  Creating exceptional customer 
experienc

I am often asked which of our 

competitors impresses me the most. 

My answer: the compegardless˚

of inat put their customers 

st and are passionate about 

having a personal connection with 

them. They are companies that are 

rg customer experiences and 

raising expectations for everyone, 

including banks. They have inspired 

us to accelerate oorts to ensure 

Wellargo iancial services 

provider of choice. This means 

being a company that connects with 

customers emotionally, technologically,˚

conveniently, and through each stage 

of thancial lives.˚
We™re also using 
technology to enhance 

our store experience 

while preserving valued 

personal service. 
Every minute, we process more than˚
20,000 customer transactions, such 
as account openings or online bill 

payments. We believe each of these 

momand the many moments our˚

customers will experience in the future˚

hould be positive memories, the 

kind that keep customers coming back˚

to do business with us, time and again.˚
Guiding our work in this area is 
what our brand stands for: ﬁTogether 

we™ll go far.ﬂ That means working 

together with our customers to help 

their visionancial 

succough relationships and 

guidance that makerence in 

our customers™ lives, from people 

who are willing to go the extra mile 

to deliver that success. This requires 

a mindset on the part of our team 

members that places an emphasis 

on teamwork, positive attitude, and 

the demonstration of care in all that 

whether we serve customers 
directly or support the people who 

do. 
We all work for the customer. 
Success here also means accepting 
that customer feedback is a gift. 

If we accept the gift, we™re certain 

to improve. For instance, feedback 

from customers led us to make 

several enhancemo 

our credit card products, including 

launching two new credit card

Prd Propel We˚

American Express network and 

expandinxibility in our credit 

card rewards program. Based on 

feedback from business customers, 

we added a feature on Wellargo 

CEobile® (our mobile service for 

business customers) that enables 

commercial card customers to easily 

photograph their receipts and upload 

them for out-of-pocket-expense 

reimbursement.˚
Digitizing the enterpris
The

 enhancement 

rur focus on ﬁdigitizing the 

enterprise,ﬂ our way of calling out 

how data and technology are shaping 

the customer experiences we deliver.˚
Digital is playing a larger role in 
all of our channels, from our award-

winning website and mobile banking 

experience to newer services at 

our bank locations, ATMs, and call 

centers. For example, we were one of 

thst banks ter Apple PayŽ as 

a convenient mobile-payment option. 

We anticipate more payment options 

to come for our mobile customers, 

because these more th

active users represent our fastest-

growing digital market segment.˚
We™re also using technology to 
enhance our store experience while 

preserving valued personal service. 

We do this because customers still 

choose to bank with us at a physical 

location; in fact, 7cent of deposit 

customers visited a bank location 

within the past six months. Many of 

our customers use three or more of our˚

service channels. This gives us a great˚

opportunity to connect our digital and˚

physical services, providing customers˚

a true omni-channel experience.˚
Customers researching new 
products can easily make an 

appointment to visit a banker directly 

from our website or mobile app. We 

are beginning ter customers the 

option to receive and acknowledge new˚

deposit account terms and conditions 

on their mobile phones, instead of 

receiving lengthy paper disclosures. 

And instead of paper receipts for teller˚

or ATM transactions, our customers 

can opt for email or text.˚
And we continue to reduce the use 
of paper in other ways. For example, 

e made substantial progress 

eliminating paper-transaction 

processing in our bank locations. 

Now, more than 4,500 bank locations 

have fully digitized processing of 

deposits, withdrawals, payments, and 

other teller transactions. For most 

transactions, customers make their 

selections on a touch screen interface,˚

withog out a paper slip. Tellers 

use high-speed scanners to process 

check deposits, eliminating the need 

for downstream paper processing. 

Electronic transactions, which we 

plan to fully impleme 

faster, provide customers quicker 

access to their deposits, and reduce 

transportation and processing costs. 

A win-win fll.˚
We are also experimenting by 
connecting our full-service teller 

and self-service ATM experiences. 

elect pilot locations, customers 

can begin their transaction at an 

ATM, but if they need more assistance˚

or if a transaction requires approval, 

a store team member is alerted 

on a wireless tablet and provides 

in-person assistance to complete 

the transaction. This assisted-

service option allows us to deliver 

the best digital experience without 

compromising on personal service.˚
Additionallye launched 
the Wellargo Startup Accelerator, 

which invests in new companies that 

are developing banking technologies 

in areas such as payments, deposits, 

and fraud detection. The accelerator™s 

equity investments range from $50,000˚

we can better understand and serve

Inclusion Council and have seen 

sthand the advantages of having 

a culture that respects and values 

team members for who they are and 

the creativity and innovation that 

come from multiple perspectives

Our multicultural focus starts at 
the top. It is no coincidence that we 

have one of the most diverse boards 

of directors in the industry: Of our 

ectors, 10 are women and/or 

people of color. I also hold each of my

.˚Leading the way in risk and 
operational excellenc

Wellargo has always been strong 

in risk management, particularly 

credit risk. Our goal is to build on our 

strengths and set the global standard 

for risk management excellence 

among aancial institutions. 

We want to incorporate robust risk 

management practices and principles 

into every aspect of our culture.˚
We believe that to continue our 
success and meet the heightened 

expectations of our key stakeholders, 

we must excel in all types of risk 

management, including credit, interest˚

rate, market, liquidity, operational, 

and reputational risk. This also 

includes cybersecurity, in which we 

are makinant investments 

to protect our customers™ information 

and assets and to safeguard our 

infrastructure and systems.˚
This doesn™t mean that we won™t 
take risks; in fact, as a bank we are in 

the business of managing risks. But we˚

will attempt to do so prudently, only 

taking risks that we fully understand 

and avoiding shortcuts for pr

the expense of our culture.˚
We manage risk in three ways: 
Our business lines have primary 

responsibility for risk and act as our 
ﬁst line of defense.ﬂ Our enterprise 

Corporate Risk team provides an 

independent review of our risks as 

a ﬁsecond line of defense.ﬂ And our 

independent Corporate Audit team 

has thal say as a ﬁthird line 

ense.ﬂ˚
Most important, though, is that 
team members understand they 

have a responsibility to raise their 

hands when they see activities that 

could put our company at risk or are 

inconsistent with our culture. This 

shared responsibility is red 

even in how we pay our people. We 

take great care to align our incentives 

with our risk management objectives.˚

management experience. She brings 

exceptional industry knowledge and 

a strong combination of leadership 

and risk management experience to 

our company. Betsy serves on the

I want to close by thanking our 
265,000 team members for our success˚

And if there is one job I must do for 

them and our customers, it is to be 

the keeper of our company™s culture.

         Innovation˚
The Digital Innovation Lab fosters 
innovation and ways to enhance customer 

experiences. Conducting pilots and 

gathering feedback are key components 

of˚Wells˚Fargo™s approach. 
Mobile banking. Real-time account 
alerts. Making an appointment 

online with a banker. Wellargo 

developed all of these digital solutions˚

by emphasizing a test-and-learn 

approach to innovation.˚
ﬁWe™re developing digital solutions 
to simplify customerancial lives 

and help them succancially,ﬂ 

said Miranda Hill, a digital product 

manager. ﬁTechnology should enable 

and enhance the relationships we™re 

building with customers.ﬂ˚
One manifestation of that 
approach is the Digital Innovation 

Lab, where Wellargo tests new 

technologies to understand how they 
can improve customerancial 

liv
before
 introducing these 

concepts tustomers.˚
From enabling customers to check˚
balances with a smart watch or 

o a mobile session using their˚

voice, the Digital Innovation Lab 

develops ways to enhance customer 

experiences. Building demos, 

launching pilots, and gathering 

feedback are key components of 

thipproach.˚
Not all of the concepts get adopted,˚
but Miranda said this strategy 

ensures that when we roll a product 

or technology into production, 

ﬁWo in an informed way.ﬂ˚

           Relationships˚
A focus on long-term relationships has 
helped take Vermeer Corporation from 

a˚single employee to 3,000. 
In 1948, Gary Vermeer started a 
company with just one product idea, 

one employee, and one building 

he™d built himself. Today Vermeer 

Corporation is a global manufacturer 

of agricultural and industrial 

equipment that makodels 

of various products, employs 

3,000 people, and operates out of 

quare-foot facility in 

Pella, Iowa, its headquarters.˚
ﬁWe develop products focused on 
improving infrastructure, managing 

natural resources, and assisting 

working farms and ranches,ﬂ said 

Mary Andringa, Gary™s daughter and 

the company™s CEO. ﬁFocusing on 

niche products is part of the culture 

my father established.ﬂ˚
Wellargo has been working with 
Vermeer since 1950, and for the past 

2ears, Mark Conway has served as 

the Commercial Banking relationship 

manager for Vermeer.˚
ﬁMark is one of the most frequent 
visitors to our headquarters,ﬂ said 

Mary, ﬁwhere everyone knows 
him by name.ﬂ Mark said Vermeer 

and Wellargo line up culturally 

ﬁbecause we both value long-term 

relationships and trust.ﬂ˚
The trust Vermeer has in WellFargo˚
was apparent when Vermeer began 

expanding internationally. CFO Steve 

Van Dusseldorp explained, ﬁWneeded˚

help understanding foreign exchange,˚

and Wellargo was therot only 

with products and services but also 

with education and forecasting tools.ﬂ˚
And when Vermeer needed to  
move its China facility from one 

location to another, a line of credit 

from Wellargo helped the 

company maintain working capital 

throughout the transition.˚
Steve said, ﬁWellargo helps us 
steward our assets and has a strong 

understanding of our business and 

cash management stratll of 

which has helped us in our company™s 

success. Even in today™s digital world, 

relationships 
are
 still important, 
and it™s clear that Wellargo values 

relationships.ﬂ˚

community-based financial services company with $1.7 trillion 

in assets. Founded in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, 
we provide banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and 
consumer and commercial finance through more than 
8,700€locations, 12,500€ATMs, the internet (wellsfargo.com) and 
mobile banking, and we have offices in 36 countries to support 
our customers who conduct business in the global economy. 
With approximately 265,000 active, full-time equivalent team 
members, we serve one in three households in the United States 
and ranked No. 29 on Fortune™s€2014 rankings of America™s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and first in the 
market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at 
December 31, 2014.€We use our Vision and Values to guide us toward growth and success. Our vision is to satisfy all our customers™ financial 
needs, help them succeed financially, be recognized as the 
premier financial services company in our markets and be one of 
America™s great companies. Important to our strategy to achieve 
this vision is to increase the number of our products our 
customers use and to offer them all of the financial products that 
fulfill their financial needs. We aspire to create deep and 
enduring relationships with our customers by discovering their 
needs and delivering the most relevant products, services, 
advice, and guidance. We have six primary values, which are based on our vision and provide the foundation for everything we do. First, we value 
and support our people as a competitive advantage and strive to 
attract, develop, retain and motivate the most talented people we 
can find. Second, we strive for the highest ethical standards with 
our team members, our customers, our communities and our 
shareholders. Third, with respect to our customers, we strive to 
base our decisions and actions on what is right for them in 
everything we do. Fourth, for team members we strive to build 
and sustain a diverse and inclusive culture - one where they feel 
valued and respected for who they are as well as for the skills and 
experiences they bring to our company. Fifth, we also look to 
each of our team members to be leaders in establishing, sharing 
and communicating our vision. Sixth, we strive to make risk 
management a competitive advantage by working hard to ensure 1 Financial information for certain periods prior to 2014 was revised to reflect our determination that certain factoring arrangements did not 
qualify as loans.€See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for more information. that appropriate controls are in place to reduce risks to our 
customers, maintain and increase our competitive market 
position, and protect Wells Fargo™s long-term safety, soundness 
and reputation. Financial Performance We completed another outstanding year of financial results in 
2014 and remained America™s most profitable bank. We 
generated record earnings, produced strong loan and deposit 
growth, grew the number of customers we serve, improved credit 
quality, enhanced our strong risk management practices, 
strengthened our capital and liquidity levels and rewarded our 
shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying back more 
shares. Wells Fargo net income was $23.1€billion in 2014, an 
increase of 5% compared with 2013, with record diluted earnings 
per share (EPS) of $4.10, also up 5% from the prior year. Our 
achievements during 2014 demonstrated the benefit of our 
diversified business model and our continued focus on the real 
economy.€Noteworthy items included:€Ł revenue of $84.3 billion, up 1% from 2013; Ł pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) of $35.3 billion, up 1%; Ł our loans increased $40.3 billion, up 5%, even with the 
planned runoff in our non-strategic/liquidating portfolios, 
and our core loan portfolio grew by $60.3 billion, up 8%; Ł our deposit franchise continued to generate strong 
customer deposit growth, with total deposits up 
$89.1€billion, or 8%; Ł our credit performance continued to be strong with total 
net charge-offs down $1.6 billion, or 35%, from a year ago 
and our net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points of 
average loans; Ł we continued to maintain solid customer relationships 
across the Company, with retail banking household cross-
sell of 6.17€products per household (November 2014); 
Wholesale Banking cross-sell of 7.2 products per 
relationship (September 2014); and Wealth, Brokerage and 
Retirement cross-sell of 10.49€products per retail banking 
household (November 2014); Ł we maintained strong capital levels as our estimated 
Common Equity Tier I ratio under Basel III (Advanced 
Approach, fully phased-in) was 10.43%; andŁ our€common stock price increased 21% and we returned 
$12.5 billion in capital to our shareholders through an 
increased common stock dividend and additional net share 
repurchases (up 74% from 2013). 30 €Balance Sheet and Liquidity Our balance sheet grew 11% in 2014 to $1.7 trillion, as we increased our liquidity position, improved the quality of our 
assets and held more capital. We grew deposits by 8% in 2014 
while reducing our deposit costs. We also grew our loans on a 
year-over-year basis for the 14th consecutive quarter (for the 
past 11 quarters year-over-year loan growth has been 3% or 
greater) despite the planned runoff from our non-strategic/ 
liquidating portfolios. Our non-strategic/liquidating loan 
portfolios decreased $20.1€billion during the year (now less than 
8% of total loans) and our core loan portfolios increased 
$60.3€billion from the prior year. Our federal funds sold, 
securities purchased under resale agreements and other short-
term investments (collectively referred to as federal funds sold 
and other short-term investments elsewhere in this Report) 
increased by $44.6€billion, or 21%, during the year on continued 
strong growth in interest-earning deposits, and we grew our 
investment securities portfolio by $48.6 billion in 2014. While 
we believe our liquidity position continued to remain strong with 
increased regulatory expectations, we have added to our position 
over the past year. We issued $24.0 billion of liquidity-related 
long-term debt as well as additional liquidity-related short-term 
funding in 2014. Deposit growth remained strong with period-end deposits up $89.1€billion from 2013. This increase reflected solid growth 
across both our commercial and consumer businesses. We grew 
our primary consumer checking customers by 5.2% and primary 
small business and business banking checking customers by 
5.4% from a year ago (November 2014 compared with November 
2013). Our ability to grow primary customers is important to our 
results because these customers have more interactions with us, 
have higher cross-sell and are more than twice as profitable as 
non-primary customers. Credit Quality Credit quality continued to improve in 2014, with solid 
performance in several of our commercial and consumer loan 
portfolios as losses remained near historically low levels, 
reflecting our long-term risk focus and the benefit from the 
improving housing market. Net charge-offs of $2.9€billion were 
0.35% of average loans, down 21€basis points from a year ago. 
Net losses in our commercial portfolio were only $44 million, or 
1 basis point of average loans. Net consumer losses declined to 
65 basis points in 2014 from 98 basis points in 2013. Our 
commercial real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position 
for each quarter of 2014 and 2013, reflecting our conservative 
risk discipline and improved market conditions. Losses on our 
consumer real estate portfolios declined $1.4€billion, or 55%, from a year ago. The consumer loss levels reflected the benefit of 
the improving economy and our continued focus on originating 
high quality loans. Approximately 60% of the consumer first 
mortgage portfolio was originated after 2008, when new 
underwriting standards were implemented. Reflecting these improvements in our loan portfolios, our provision for credit losses in 2014 was $1.4 billion compared 
with $2.3€billion a year ago. This provision reflected a release of 
$1.6€billion from the allowance for credit losses, compared with a 
release of $2.2 billion a year ago. Future allowance levels may 
increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan 
growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. In addition to lower net charge-offs and provision expense, nonperforming assets (NPAs) also improved and were down 
$4.1€billion, or 21%, from 2013. Nonaccrual loans declined 
$2.8€billion from the prior year while foreclosed assets were 
down $1.3 billion from 2013. Capital We continued to strengthen our capital levels in 2014 even as we 
returned more capital to our shareholders, increasing total 
equity to $185.3 billion at December 31, 2014, up $14.3 billion 
from the prior year. In 2014, our common shares outstanding 
declined by 86.8 million shares as we continued to reduce our 
common share count through the repurchase of 183.1 million 
common shares during the year. Also, we entered into a 
$750€million forward repurchase contract with an unrelated 
third party in October 2014 that settled in January 2015 for 
14.3€million shares. In addition, we entered into another 
$750€million forward repurchase contract with an unrelated 
third party in January 2015 that is expected to settle in second 
quarter 2015 for approximately 14.3 million shares. We expect 
our share count to continue to decline in 2015 as a result of 
anticipated net share repurchases. We believe an important measure of our capital strength is the estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, using 
the Advanced Approach, fully phased-in, which increased to 
10.43% in 2014 from 9.76% a year ago. Our regulatory capital ratios under Basel III (General Approach) remained strong with a total risk-based capital ratio 
of 15.53%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.45% and Tier 1 
leverage ratio of 9.45% at December 31, 2014, compared with 
15.43%, 12.33% and 9.60%, respectively, at December 31, 2013. 
See the ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section in this Report for more 
information regarding our capital, including the calculation of 
common equity for regulatory purposes. 31 Overview (continued) Table 1: Six-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data

33      Earnings Performance Wells Fargo net income for 2014 was $23.1 billion ($4.10 diluted 
earnings per common share), compared with $21.9 billion 

($3.89 diluted per share) for 2013 and $18.9 billion 

($3.36€diluted per share) for 2012. Our 2014 earnings reflected 

strong execution of our business strategy as well as growth in 
many of our businesses. Our financial performance in 2014 

benefited from a $914 million reduction in our provision for 

credit losses, reflecting strong underlying credit performance. 
We also generated diversified sources of fee income across many 
of our businesses and grew loans and deposits. Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, was $84.3 billion in 2014, compared with $83.8 billion 

in 2013 and $86.1 billion in 2012. The increase in revenue for 

2014 compared with 2013 was predominantly due to an increase 

in net interest income, reflecting increases in income from 
trading assets and investment securities. Our diversified sources 
of revenue generated by our businesses continued to be balanced 
between net interest income and noninterest income. In 2014, 

net interest income of $43.5 billion represented 52% of revenue, 

compared with $42.8 billion (51%) in 2013 and $43.2 billion 

(50%) in 2012. 
Noninterest income was $40.8 billion in 2014, representing 
48% of revenue, compared with $41.0 billion (49%) in 2013 and 

$42.9 billion (50%) in 2012. The decrease in 2014 was driven 

predominantly by a 27% decline in mortgage banking income 

due to decreased net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales 
activities, partially offset by higher trust and investment fee 
income. Mortgage loan originations were $175 billion in 2014, 

down from $351 billion a year ago. 
Noninterest expense was $49.0 billion in 2014, compared 
with $48.8 billion in 2013 and $50.4 billion in 2012. The 

increase in noninterest expense in 2014, compared with 2013, 

reflected higher salaries expense and other expenses, including 
operating losses and outside professional services. Noninterest 
expense as a percentage of revenue (efficiency ratio) was 58.1% 

in 2014, 58.3% in 2013 and 58.5% in 2012, reflecting our 

expense management efforts. Table 3 presents the components of revenue and noninterest expense as a percentage of revenue for year-over-year results. 34 Table 3:€Net Interest Income, Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense as a Percentage of Revenue

35 Earnings Performance (continued) Net Interest Income Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid for deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest 
income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-
equivalent basis in Table 5 to consistently reflect income from 
taxable and tax-exempt loans and securities based on a 35% 
federal statutory tax rate. While the Company believes that it has the ability to increase net interest income over time, net interest income and 
the net interest margin in any one period can be significantly 
affected by a variety of factors including the mix and overall size 
of our earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those 
assets. In addition, some variable sources of interest income, 
such as resolutions from purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, 
loan prepayment fees and collection of interest on nonaccrual 
loans, can vary from period to period. Net interest income 
growth has been challenged during the prolonged low interest 
rate environment as higher yielding loans and securities runoff 
have been replaced with lower yielding assets. The pace of this 
repricing has slowed in recent quarters. Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $44.4€billion in 2014, compared with $43.6 billion in 2013, and 
$43.9 billion in 2012. The net interest margin was 3.11% in 2014, 
down 29 basis points from 3.40% in 2013, which was down 
36€basis points from 3.76% in 2012. The increase in net interest 
income for 2014, compared with 2013, was largely driven by 
securities purchases, higher trading balances, and reduced 

term debt yields.€Strong growth in commercial, retained real 
estate and automobile loans also contributed to higher net 

strategic/liquidating portfolios.€The improvement in net interest 
income was partially offset by the impact of lower mortgages 
held for sale (MHFS) balances.€The decline in net interest 
margin in 2014, compared with a year ago, was primarily driven 
by higher funding balances, including actions taken in response 

term debt and term deposits in addition to customer-driven 
deposit growth. This growth in funding increased cash and 
federal funds sold and other short-term investments and was 
dilutive to net interest margin although essentially neutral to net 
interest income. Table 4 presents the components of earning assets and funding sources as a percentage of earning assets to provide a 
more meaningful analysis of year-over-year changes that 
influenced net interest income. Average earning assets increased $147.3 billion in 2014 
from a year ago, as average investment securities increased 
$30.6 billion and average federal funds sold and other short-

term investments increased $86.4 billion for the same period, 

respectively. In addition, average loans increased $31.8 billion in 

2014, compared with a year ago. The increases in average 
investment securities, average federal funds sold and other 
short-term investments and average loans were partially offset 
by a $16.3 billion decline in average MHFS. 
Core deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 
Core deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-
bearing checking, savings certificates, market rate and other 
savings, and certain foreign deposits (Eurodollar sweep 
balances). Average core deposits rose to $1.0 trillion in 2014, 

compared with $942.1 billion in 2013, and funded 120% of 

average loans compared with 117% a year ago. Average core 

deposits decreased to 70% of average earning assets in 2014, 

compared with 73% a year ago. The cost of these deposits has 

continued to decline due to a sustained low interest rate 
environment and a shift in our deposit mix from higher cost 
certificates of deposit to lower yielding checking and savings 
products. About 96% of our average core deposits are in 
checking and savings deposits, one of the highest industry 
percentages. Table 5 presents the individual components of net interest income and the net interest margin. The effect on interest 
income and costs of earning asset and funding mix changes 
described above, combined with rate changes during 2014, are 
analyzed in Table 6. 36 Table 4:€Average Earning Assets and Funding Sources as a Percentage of Average Earnings Assets

for 2014 compared with $41.0 billion, or 49%, for 2013 and 
$42.9 billion, or 50%, for 2012. The decrease in noninterest 
income in 2014 was primarily due to a decline in mortgage 
banking, partially offset by growth in many of our other 
businesses including debit card, corporate banking, principal 
investments, asset-backed finance, equipment finance, 
international, venture capital, wealth management and retail 
brokerage. Excluding mortgage banking, noninterest income 
increased $2.2 billion from a year ago. 
Service charges on deposit accounts increased $27 million from 2013 due to account growth, new commercial product sales 
and commercial product re-pricing, partially offset by changes 
we implemented in early October 2014 designed to provide 
customers with more real time information to manage their 
deposit accounts and avoid overdrafts. Service charges on 
deposit accounts in 2013 increased $340€million, or 7%, from 
2012 due to primary consumer checking customer growth, 
product changes and customer adoption of overdraft services. Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees are received for providing services to full-service and discount 
brokerage customers. Income from these brokerage-related 
activities include asset-based fees, which are based on the 
market value of the customer™s assets, and transactional 
commissions based on the number and size of transactions 
executed at the customer™s direction. These fees increased to 
$9.2 billion in 2014, from $8.4 billion and $7.5€billion in 2013 

and 2012, respectively. The increase in brokerage income was 
predominantly due to higher asset-based fees as a result of 
higher market values and growth in assets under management, 
partially offset by a decrease in brokerage transaction revenue. 
Retail brokerage client assets totaled $1.42€trillion at 
December€31, 2014, up 4% from $1.36 trillion at December€31,€2013, which was up 12% from $1.22 trillion at 
December 31, 2012. We earn trust and investment management fees from managing and administering assets, including mutual funds, 
corporate trust, personal trust, employee benefit trust and 
agency assets. Trust and investment management fees are 
largely based on a tiered scale relative to the market value of the 
assets under management or administration. These fees 
increased to $3.4 billion in 2014 from $3.3 billion in 2013 and 

$3.1 billion in 2012, primarily due to growth in assets under 
management reflecting higher market values. At 
December€31,€2014, these assets totaled $2.5 trillion, an increase 
from $2.4€trillion and $2.2 trillion at December 31, 2013 and 
2012, respectively. We earn investment banking fees from underwriting debt and equity securities, arranging loan syndications, and 
performing other related advisory services. Investment banking 
fees remained unchanged at $1.7 billion in 2014 compared with 

2013 as higher advisory services results were offset by lower loan 
syndication and origination fees. Investment banking fees 
increased $460 million in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily 
due to increased loan syndication volume and equity 
originations. Card fees were $3.4 billion in 2014, compared with 
$3.2€billion€in 2013 and $2.8 billion in 2012. Card fees increased 
in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to account growth and increased 
purchase activity. Other fees of $4.3 billion in 2014 were unchanged compared 
with 2013 as a decline in charges and fees on loans was offset by 
an increase in commercial real estate brokerage commissions. 
Other fees in 2013 declined $179 million compared with 2012 
due to a decline in charges and fees on loans. Charges and fees 
on loans decreased to $1.3 billion in 2014 compared with 

$1.5€billion and $1.7€billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively, 
primarily due to the phase out of the direct deposit advance 
product during the first half of 2014. Commercial real estate 
brokerage commissions increased to $469 million in 2014 

compared with $338 million in 2013 and $307 million in 2012, 
driven by increased sales and other property-related activities 
including financing and advisory services. Mortgage banking income, consisting of net servicing income and net gains on loan origination/sales activities, totaled 
$6.4 billion in 2014, compared with $8.8€billion in 2013 and 
$11.6 billion in 2012. In addition to servicing fees, net mortgage loan servicing income includes amortization of commercial mortgage servicing 
rights (MSRs), changes in the fair value of residential MSRs 
during the period, as well as changes in the value of derivatives 
(economic hedges) used to hedge the residential MSRs. Net 
servicing income of $3.3 billion for 2014 included a $1.4 billion 

net MSR valuation gain ($2.1€billion decrease in the fair value of 

the MSRs offset by a $3.5 billion hedge gain). Net servicing 

income of $1.9 billion for 2013 included a $489 million net MSR 
valuation gain ($3.4€billion increase in the fair value of the MSRs 
offset by a $2.9 billion hedge loss), and net servicing income of 
$1.4 billion for 2012 included a $681 million net MSR valuation 
gain ($2.9€billion decrease in the fair value of MSRs offset by a 
$3.6€billion hedge gain). The lower net MSR valuation gain in 
2013, compared with 2014, was attributable to MSR valuation 
adjustments associated with higher prepayments and increases 
in servicing and foreclosure costs. Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.86 trillion at December 31, 2014, $1.90€trillion at December€31, 2013, and 
$1.91 trillion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2014, the 
ratio of MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 0.75%, 
41   Earnings Performance (continued) compared with 0.88% at December€31,€2013 and 0.67% at December 31, 2012. See the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability 
Management Œ Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Riskﬂ section in this Report for additional information regarding 
our MSRs risks and hedging approach. Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sale activities were $3.0 billion in 2014, compared with $6.9 billion in 2013 and 

$10.3 billion in 2012. The decrease from 2013 and 2012 was 
primarily driven by lower origination volume and margins. 
Mortgage loan originations were $175 billion in 2014, of which 

68% were for home purchases, compared with $351 billion and 
47%, respectively, for 2013 and $524 billion and 35%, 
respectively, for 2012. Mortgage applications were $262 billion 

in 2014, compared with $438 billion in 2013 and $736 billion in 
2012. The 1-4 family first mortgage unclosed pipeline was 
$26€billion at December 31, 2014, compared with $25€billion at 

December 31, 2013 and $81 billion at December 31, 2012. For 
additional information about our mortgage banking activities 
and results, see the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability 
Management Œ Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Riskﬂ section and Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and 
Note€17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities include adjustments to the mortgage repurchase liability. 
Mortgage loans are repurchased from third parties based on 
standard representations and warranties, and early payment 
default clauses in mortgage sale contracts. For 2014, we released 
a net $140 million from the repurchase liability, compared with 
a provision of $428 million for 2013 and $1.9 billion for 2012. 
For additional information about mortgage loan repurchases, see 
the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Management Œ Liability for 
Mortgage Loan Repurchase Lossesﬂ section and Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We engage in trading activities primarily to accommodate the investment activities of our customers, execute economic 
hedging to manage certain of our balance sheet risks and for a 
very limited amount of proprietary trading for our own account. 
Net gains (losses) from trading activities, which reflect 
unrealized changes in fair value of our trading positions and 
realized gains and losses, were $1.2 billion in 2014, $1.6 billion 

in 2013 and $1.7 billion in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in 
2014 was driven by lower trading from customer 
accommodation activity within our capital markets business and 
lower deferred compensation gains (offset in employee benefits 
expense), and the decrease in 2013 from 2012 was largely driven 
by lower results in customer accommodation activity. Net gains 
from trading activities do not include interest and dividend 
income and expense on trading securities. Those amounts are 
reported within interest income from trading assets and other 
interest expense from trading liabilities. Interest and fees related 
to proprietary trading are reported in their corresponding 
income statement line items. Proprietary trading activities are 
not significant to our client-focused business model. For 
additional information about proprietary and other trading, see 
the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Management Œ Market 
Risk Œ Trading Activitiesﬂ section in this Report. Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $3.0€billion 
for 2014 and $1.4€billion

than-temporary impairment (OTTI) write-downs of 
$322€million, $344€million and $416€million, respectively, for 

the same periods. The increase in net gains on debt and equity 
securities reflected the benefit of strong public and private equity 
markets. All other income was $456 million for 2014 compared with 
$113 million in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012. All other income 
includes ineffectiveness recognized on derivatives that qualify 
for hedge accounting, losses on low-income housing tax credit 
investments, foreign currency adjustments and income from 
investments accounted for under the equity method, any of 
which can cause decreases and net losses in other income. 
Higher other income for 2014 compared with a year ago 
primarily reflected larger ineffectiveness gains on derivatives 
that qualify for hedge accounting, a gain on sale of government-
guaranteed student loans in fourth quarter 2014, and a gain on 
sale of 40 insurance offices in second quarter 2014. These were

2012. The increase in 2014 was driven predominantly by higher 
operating losses ($1.2 billion, up from $821 million in 2013) and 
higher outside professional services ($2.7 billion, up from 
$2.5€billion in 2013), partially offset by lower personnel 
expenses ($29.9€billion, down from $30.1 billion in 2013). The 
decrease in 2013 from 2012 was driven by lower operating 
losses, lower foreclosed assets expense and lower FDIC and 
other deposit assessments, as well as the completion of 
Wachovia merger integration activities in first quarter 2012. Personnel expenses, which include salaries, commissions, incentive compensation and employee benefits, were down 
$194€million, or 1%, in 2014 compared with 2013, due to lower 
deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue) 
and other employee benefit costs, and reduced staffing and lower 
volume-related compensation in our mortgage business. These 
decreases were partially offset by higher revenue-based 
compensation, annual salary increases, and increased staffing 
for risk management and our non-mortgage businesses. For 
2013, these expenses were up 5% compared with 2012, due to 
annual salary increases and related salary taxes, higher revenue-based compensation, and higher employee benefit costs. Outside professional services were up 7% in 2014 compared with 2013 due to continued investments by our businesses in their service delivery systems and in our risk management 
infrastructure to meet increased regulatory and compliance 
requirements as well as evolving cybersecurity risk. Operating losses were up $428 million, or 52%, in 2014 compared with 2013, predominantly due to higher litigation 
accruals. All other expenses of $2.0 billion in 2014 were down slightly from $2.1 billion in 2013, which were down from $2.4€billion in 
2012. The decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily 
due to a $250 million charitable contribution to Wells Fargo 
Foundation in 2012. Our full year 2014 efficiency ratio improved slightly to 58.1% compared with 58.3% in 2013. The Company expects to 
operate within its targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% - 59% for 
full year 2015. Income Tax Expense The 2014 annual effective tax rate was 30.9% compared with 
32.2% in 2013 and 32.5% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2014 
included a net reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax 
positions primarily due to the resolution of prior period matters 
with state taxing authorities. The effective tax rate for 2013 
included a net reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax 
positions primarily due to settlements with authorities regarding 
certain cross border transactions and tax benefits recognized 
from the realization for tax purposes of a previously written 
down investment. The 2012 effective tax rate included a tax 
benefit resulting from the surrender of previously written-down 
Wachovia life insurance investments. See Note€21 (Income 
Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for information 
regarding tax matters related to undistributed foreign earnings. 43 Earnings Performance (continued) Operating Segments We are organized for management reporting purposes into three operating segments: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; 
and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement (WBR). These segments 
are defined by product type and customer segment and their 
results are based on our management accounting process, for 
which there is no comprehensive, authoritative financial 
accounting guidance equivalent to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). In addition to measuring financial Table 9:€Operating Segment Results Œ Highlights 
performance, each of our operating segments monitors cross-sell 
metrics to measure the extent they are satisfying our customers™ 
financial needs. The following discussion presents our 
methodology for measuring cross-sell for each of our operating 
segments, and along with Tables 9, 9a, 9b and 9c, presents our 
results by operating segment. For additional financial 
information and the underlying management accounting 
process, see Note€24 (Operating Segments) to Financial

Cross-sell Our cross-sell strategy is to increase the number of products our customers use by offering them all of the financial 
products that satisfy their financial needs. We track our cross-
sell activities based on whether the customer is a retail banking 
household or has a wholesale banking relationship. A retail 
banking household is a household that uses at least one of the 
following retail products - a demand deposit account, savings 
account, savings certificate, individual retirement account (IRA) 
certificate of deposit, IRA savings account, personal line of 
credit, personal loan, home equity line of credit or home equity 
loan. A household is determined based on aggregating all 
accounts with the same address. For our wholesale banking 
relationships, we aggregate all related entities under common 
ownership or control. We report cross-sell metrics for our Community Banking and WBR operating segments based on the average number of 
retail products used per retail banking household. For 
Community Banking the cross-sell metric represents the 
relationship of all retail products used by customers in retail 
banking households. For WBR the cross-sell metric represents 
the relationship of all retail products used by customers in retail 
banking households who are also WBR customers. Products included in our retail banking household cross-sell metrics must be retail products and have the potential for revenue generation and long-term viability. Products and 
services that generally do not meet these criteria - such as ATM 
cards, online banking and direct deposit - are not included. In 
addition, multiple holdings by a brokerage customer within an 
investment category, such as common stock, mutual funds or 
bonds, are counted as a single product. We may periodically update the products included in our cross-sell metrics to account for changes in our product offerings. 
For our Wholesale Banking operating segment cross-sell retail) products used per Wholesale Banking customer 
relationship. What we include as products in the cross-sell 
metric comes from a defined set of revenue generating products 
within the following product families: credit, treasury 
management, deposits, risk management, foreign exchange, 
capital markets and advisory, investments, insurance, trade 
financing, and trust and servicing. The number of customer 
relationships is based on tax identification numbers adjusted to 
combine those entities under common ownership or another 
structure indicative of a single relationship and includes only 
relationships that produced revenue for the period of 
measurement. 44  Operating Segment Results The following discussion provides a description of each of our 
operating segments, including cross-sell metrics and financial 
results. COMMUNITY BANKING offers a complete line of diversified financial products and services for consumers and small 
businesses including checking and savings accounts, credit and 
debit cards, and auto, student, and small business lending. These 
products also include investment, insurance and trust services in 
39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 50 
states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo 
Home Lending business units. The Community Banking 
segment also includes the results of our Corporate Treasury 
activities net of allocations in support of the other operating 
segments and results of investments in our affiliated venture Table 9a - Community Banking capital partnerships. Our retail banking household cross-sell was 
6.17€products per household in November 2014, up from 6.16 in 
November 2013 and 6.05 in November 2012. The November 
2014 cross-sell ratio included the acquisition of an existing 
private label and co-branded credit card loan portfolio in 
connection with a new program agreement with Dillard's, Inc. 
(Dillard's), a major retail department store. We believe there is 
more opportunity for cross-sell as we continue to earn more 
business from our customers. Our goal is eight products per 
household, which is approximately one-half of our estimate of 
potential demand for an average U.S. household. In November 
2014, one of every four of our retail banking households had 
eight or more of our products. Table 9a provides additional 
financial information for Community Banking.

45  Earnings Performance (continued) Community Banking reported net income of $14.2 billion in 2014, up $1.4 billion, or 11%, from $12.7 billion in 2013, which was up 21% from $10.5 billion in 2012. Revenue was 
$50.9€billion in 2014, an increase of $523 million, or 1%, 
compared with $50.3 billion in 2013, which was down 6% 
compared with $53.4 billion in 2012. The increase in revenue for 
2014 was primarily driven by higher net interest income, gains 
on sale of equity investments and debt securities, higher trust 
and investment fees, and higher card fees, partially offset by 
lower mortgage banking revenue, the phase out of the direct 
deposit advance product during the first half of 2014, and lower 
deferred compensation plan investment gains (offset in 
employee benefits expense). Higher other income for 2014 
compared with a year ago reflected larger ineffectiveness gains 
on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and a gain on 
sale of government guaranteed student loans in fourth quarter 
2014. The decrease in 2013 was a result of lower mortgage 
banking revenue, partially offset by higher trust and investment 
fees, and revenue from debit, credit and merchant card volumes. 
Lower other segment income for 2013 compared with 2012 was 
due to larger ineffectiveness losses on derivatives that qualify for 
hedge accounting and interest-related valuation changes on 
certain mortgage-related assets carried at fair value. Average 
core deposits increased $22.2€billion in 2014, or 4%, from 2013, 
which increased $28.9€billion, or 5%, from 2012. Noninterest 
expense decreased $597 million in 2014, or 2%, from 2013, 
which declined $2.1 billion, or 7%, from 2012. The decrease in noninterest expense for 2014 largely reflected lower mortgage 
volume-related expenses and deferred compensation expense 
(offset in revenue), partially offset by higher operating losses. 
The decrease in noninterest expense for 2013 reflected lower 
FDIC and other deposit insurance assessments primarily due to 
lower FDIC assessment rates. The provision for credit losses of 
$1.7 billion in 2014 was 39% lower than 2013, which was 
$2.8€billion, or 60%, lower than 2012, due to improved 
performance of the consumer real estate portfolio in both 2014 
and 2013. WHOLESALE BANKING provides financial solutions to businesses across the United States and globally with annual 
sales generally in excess of $20 million. Products and business

in net income during 2014 was the result of lower revenues, increased noninterest expense and higher provision for credit losses. The year over year increase in net income during 2013 was the result of improvement in provision for credit losses and 
stable revenue performance partially offset by increased 
noninterest expense. Revenue in 2014 of $23.5€billion decreased $582 million, or 2%, from $24.1 billion in 2013, as growth in asset backed finance, asset management, commercial real estate brokerage, corporate banking, equipment finance, international, 
principal investing and treasury management was more than 
offset by lower PCI resolution income as well as lower crop insurance fee income. Revenue in 2013 of $24.1 billion was flat from 2012, as business growth from asset backed finance, asset management, capital markets and commercial real estate was offset by lower PCI resolution income. Net interest income of $12.0 billion in 2014 decreased $343€million, or 3%, from 2013, which was down 3% from 2012. The decrease in 2014 and 2013 was due to lower PCI resolutions 
and net interest margin compression due to declining loan yields and fees that was partially offset by increased interest income primarily from strong loan growth. Average loans of $313.4€billion in 2014 increased $25.7 billion, or 9%, from 
$287.7 billion in 2013, which was up 5% from $273.8 billion in 
2012. The loan growth in 2014 and 2013 was broad based across many Wholesale Banking businesses. Average core deposits of $274.0 billion in 2014 increased $36.8 billion, or 16%, from 2013 which was up 4%, from 2012, reflecting continued strong 
customer liquidity for both years. Noninterest income of $11.5€billion in 2014 decreased $239€million, or 2%, from 2013 as business growth in asset backed finance, asset management, commercial real estate brokerage, corporate banking, equipment finance, international, principal investing and treasury management was more than offset by lower customer accommodation related gains on 47 Earnings Performance (continued) trading assets, lower insurance income related to a decline in crop insurance fee income and the 2014 divestiture of 40 
insurance offices, and lower other income. The reduction in 
other income was caused by the financial results of low-income 
housing tax credits and other nonmarketable investments which 
are accounted for under the equity accounting method, partially 
offset by a gain on the divestiture of the 40 insurance offices. 
Noninterest income of $11.8€billion in 2013 increased 
$322€million, or 3%, from 2012 due to strong growth in asset 
backed finance, asset management, capital markets, commercial 
banking, commercial real estate and corporate banking. 
Noninterest expense in 2014 increased $597 million, or 5%, 
compared with 2013, which was up 2%, or $296 million, from 
2012. The increase in both 2014 and 2013 was due to higher 
personnel expenses and higher non-personnel expenses related 
to growth initiatives and compliance and regulatory 
requirements. The provision for credit losses increased 
$179€million from 2013 due primarily to strong commercial loan 
growth in 2014. The provision for credit losses in 2013 decreased 
$731 million from 2012, due to lower loan losses. Table 9c - Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement WEALTH, BROKERAGE AND RETIREMENT provides a full range of financial advisory services to clients using a planning

48     €Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement reported net income of $2.1 billion in 2014, up $371 million, or 22%, from 2013, which was up 29% from $1.3 billion in 2012. Net income growth in 
2014 was driven by significant growth in noninterest income and 
net interest income. Growth in net income for 2013 was driven 
by higher noninterest income and lower provision for credit 
losses due to improved credit quality. Revenue of $14.2€billion in 
2014 increased $1.0 billion from 2013, which was up 9% from $12.2 billion in 2012. The increase in revenue for both 2014 and 
2013 was due to increases in both net interest income and 
noninterest income. Net interest income increased 10% in 2014 due to growth in investment portfolios and loan balances. Net 
interest income increased 4% in 2013 due to growth in loan 
balances and low-cost core deposits, partially offset by lower 
interest rates on the loan and investment portfolios. Average loan balances of $52.1 billion in 2014 increased 13% 
from $46.1 billion in 2013, which was up 8% from $42.7 billion 

in 2012. Average core deposits in 2014 of $154.9 billion 
increased 3% from $150.1 billion in 2013, which was up 9% from Balance Sheet Analysis $137.5 billion in 2012. Noninterest income increased 7% in 2014 
from 2013, largely due to strong growth in asset-based fees from 
growth in assets under management primarily from net inflows 
and improved market performance, partially offset by lower 
brokerage transaction revenue. Noninterest income increased 
10% in 2013 from 2012, largely due to strong growth in asset-
based fees from improved market performance and growth in 
assets under management, partially offset by reduced securities 
gains in the brokerage business. Noninterest expense of 
$10.9€billion for 2014 was up 4% from $10.5 billion in 2013, 

which was up 6% from $9.9 billion in 2012. The increase in 2014 

was predominantly due to increased broker commissions and 
higher non-personnel expenses. The increase in 2013 was 
predominantly due to higher personnel expenses, primarily 
reflecting increased broker commissions. The provision for 
credit losses improved for both 2014 and 2013, driven by lower 
net charge-offs and continued improvement in credit quality. At December€31, 2014, our assets totaled $1.7 trillion, up 

$163.7€billion from December€31, 2013. The predominant areas 

of asset growth were in federal funds sold and other short-term 
investments, which increased $44.6 billion, investment 

securities, which increased $48.6 billion, loans, which increased 

$40.3 billion ($50.0 billion excluding the transfer of $9.7 billion 

of government guaranteed student loans to loans held for sale at 
June 30, 2014), and trading assets, which increased 
$15.4€billion. Deposit growth of $89.1 billion, an increase in 

long-term debt of $30.9 billion, total equity growth of 

$14.3€billion and an increase in short-term borrowings of 
$9.6€billion from December€31, 2013, were the predominant 

sources that funded our asset growth for 2014. Equity growth 

benefited from $14.7 billion in earnings net of dividends paid.

Table 10 presents a summary of our investment securities The size and composition of the investment securities portfolio, which increased $48.6 billion from December€31, 
portfolio is largely dependent upon the Company™s liquidity and 2013, predominantly due to purchases of U.S. Treasury 
interest rate risk management objectives.€Our business generates securities. The total net unrealized gains on available-for-sale assets and liabilities, such as loans, deposits and long-term debt, securities were $7.8 billion at December€31, 2014, up from net

characteristics and other provisions that expose us to interest primarily to a decrease in long-term interest rates. rate and liquidity risk.€The available-for-sale securities portfolio 
consists primarily of liquid, high quality U.S. Treasury and 49 Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) federal agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), privately issued residential and commercial MBS, securities 
issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt 
securities, and highly rated collateralized loan obligations. Due 
to its highly liquid nature, the available-for-sale portfolio can be 
used to meet funding needs that arise in the normal course of 
business or due to market stress.€Changes in our interest rate 
risk profile may occur due to changes in overall economic or 
market conditions, which could influence loan origination 
demand, prepayment speeds, or deposit balances and mix.€In 
response, the available-for-sale securities portfolio can be 
rebalanced to meet the Company™s interest rate risk 
management objectives.€In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the available-for-sale 
securities portfolio may provide yield enhancement over other 
short-term assets.€See the ﬁRisk Management - Asset/Liability 
Managementﬂ section in this Report for more information on 
liquidity and interest rate risk. The held-to-maturity securities 
portfolio consists of high quality U.S. Treasury debt, securities 
issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, agency MBS, 
asset-backed securities (ABS) primarily collateralized by auto 
loans and leases, and collateralized loan obligations, where our 
intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the 
contractual cash flows. The held-to-maturity portfolio may also 
provide yield enhancement over short-term assets. We analyze securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) quarterly or more often if a potential loss-triggering 
event occurs.€Of the $322 million in OTTI write-downs 

recognized in earnings in 2014, $49 million related to debt 

securities and $3 million related to marketable equity securities, 

which are each included in available-for-sale securities. Another 
$270 million in OTTI write-downs was related to nonmarketable 

equity investments, which are included in other assets. For a 
discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and underlying 
considerations and analysis see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Investment Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. At December€31, 2014, investment securities included 
$46.9€billion of municipal bonds, of which 91.7% were rated ﬁA-ﬂ 

or better based predominantly on external and, in some cases, 
internal ratings.€Additionally, some of the securities in our total 
municipal bond portfolio are guaranteed against loss by bond 
insurers. These guaranteed bonds are substantially all 
investment grade and were generally underwritten in accordance 
with our own investment standards prior to the determination to 
purchase, without relying on the bond insurer™s guarantee in 
making the investment decision. Our municipal bond holdings 
are monitored as part of our ongoing impairment analysis. The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities available-for-sale was 6.2 years at December€31, 2014. Because 

54% of this portfolio is MBS, the expected remaining maturity is 

shorter than the remaining contractual maturity because 
borrowers generally have the right to prepay obligations before 
the underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effects of a 
200€basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the fair 
value and the expected remaining maturity of the MBS available-
for-sale portfolio are shown in Table 11. Table 11:€Mortgage-Backed Securities

from December€31, 2013. Table 12 provides a summary of total 

outstanding loans by non-strategic/liquidating and core loan 
portfolios. The decrease in the non-strategic/liquidating 
portfolios was $20.1 billion, while loans in the core portfolio 

grew $60.3 billion from December 31, 2013. Our core loan 

growth during 2014 included: 
Ł a $38.6 billion increase in commercial loans, reflecting 

broad-based growth in our portfolios, including $6.5 billion 
from the financing related to the sale of government 
guaranteed student loans out of loans held for sale in fourth 
quarter 2014. For additional information on the government 
guaranteed student loan sale, see Note 8 (Securitizations 
and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in 
this Report; and Table 12:€Loan Portfolios 
Ł a $21.7 billion increase in consumer loans, predominantly 

from growth in the nonconforming mortgage, automobile, 
credit card and other revolving credit and installment loan 
portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the real estate 1-4 
family junior lien mortgage portfolio and the transfer of the 
government guaranteed student loan portfolio to loans held 
for sale at the end of second quarter 2014. The increase in 
consumer loans also included the acquisition of an existing 
private label and co-branded credit card loan portfolio in 
fourth quarter 2014 in connection with the new Dillard's 
program agreement. Additional information on the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios is included in Table 17 in the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Managementﬂ section in this Report.

Equity Total equity was $185.3 billion at December€31, 2014 compared 
with $171.0 billion at December€31, 2013. The increase was 

predominantly driven by a $14.7 billion increase in retained 

earnings from earnings net of dividends paid and a $2.1€billion 

increase in cumulative other comprehensive income (OCI). The 
increase in OCI was substantially due to a $3.9€billion 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ($2.4€billion after tax) increase in net unrealized gains on our 


term interest rates. See Note 5 (Investment Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend, 
transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. Commitments to Lend and Purchase Securities We enter into commitments to lend funds to customers, which 
are usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we make commitments, we 
are exposed to credit risk. However, the maximum credit risk for 
these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not expected to be fully used or will expire without being used by 
the customer. For more information on lending commitments, 
see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. We also enter into commitments to 
purchase securities under resale agreements. For more 
information on these commitments, see Note 4 (Federal Funds 
Sold, Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Other 
Short-Term Investments) to Financial Statements in this Report. Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities We routinely enter into various types of on- and off-balance 
sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which 
are corporations, trusts or partnerships that are established for a 
limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions. For more information on 
securitizations, including sales proceeds and cash flows from 
securitizations, see Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Guarantees and Certain Contingent 
Arrangements Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities 
lending and other indemnifications, written put options, 
recourse obligations for loans and mortgages sold, and other 
types of arrangements. For more information on guarantees and certain contingent arrangements, see Note 14 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and 
Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report. Derivatives We primarily use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and 
volumes can be measured in terms of the notional amount, 
which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on 
which interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of 
the instruments. For more information on derivatives, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. Contractual Cash Obligations In addition to the contractual commitments and arrangements 
previously described, which, depending on the nature of the 
obligation, may or may not require use of our resources, we enter 
into other contractual obligations that may require future cash 
payments in the ordinary course of business, including debt 
issuances for the funding of operations and leases for premises 
and equipment. 52 Table 15 summarizes these contractual obligations as of obligations is in Note 12 (Short-Term Borrowings) and Note 20

Statements in this Report for more information. 53 Risk Management Financial institutions must manage a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance. Among 
the key risks that we must manage are operational risks, credit 
risks, and asset/liability management risks, which include 
interest rate, market, and liquidity and funding risks. Our risk 
culture is strongly rooted in our Vision and Values, and in order to succeed in our mission of satisfying all our customers™ 
financial needs and helping them succeed financially, our 
business practices and operating model must support prudent 
risk management practices. Risk Management Framework and Culture The key elements of our risk management framework and 
culture include the following: 
Ł We strongly believe in managing risk as close to 
the source as possible.€We manage risk through three 
lines of defense, and the first line of defense is our team 
members in our lines of business who are responsible for 
identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, mitigating, 
and owning the risks in their businesses. All of our team 
members have accountability for risk management. Ł We recognize the importance of strong oversight.€Our Corporate Risk group, led by our Chief Risk Officer 
who reports to the Board™s Risk Committee, as well as 
other corporate functions such as the Law Department, 
Corporate Controllers, and the Human Resources 
Department serve as the second line of defense and 
provide company-wide leadership, oversight, an enterprise 
view, and appropriate challenge to help ensure effective 
and consistent understanding and management of all risks 
by our lines of business. Wells Fargo Audit Services, led by 
our Chief Auditor who reports to the Board™s Audit and 
Examination Committee, serves as the third line of defense 
and through its audit, assurance, and advisory work 
evaluates and helps improve the effectiveness of the 
governance, risk management, and control processes 
across the enterprise. Ł We have a significant bias for conservatism.€We 
strive to maintain a conservative financial position 
measured by satisfactory asset quality, capital levels, 
funding sources, and diversity of revenues. Our risk is 
distributed by geography, product type, industry segment, 
and asset class, and while we want to grow the Company, 

term goals and does not compromise our ability to manage 
risk. Ł We have a long-term customer focus.€Our focus is 
on knowing our customers and meeting our customers™ 
long-term financial needs by offering products and value-
added services that are appropriate for their needs and 
circumstances. In addition, our team members are 
committed to operational excellence, and we recognize 
that our infrastructure, systems, processes, and 
compliance programs must support the financial success 
of our customers through a superior customer service 
experience. Ł We must understand and follow our risk appetite.€Our risk management framework is based on 
understanding and following our overall enterprise 
statement of risk appetite, which describes the nature and 
level of risks that we are willing to take to achieve our 
strategic and business objectives. This statement provides the philosophical underpinnings that guide business and 
risk leaders as they manage risk on a day-to-day basis. Our 
CEO and Operating Committee, which consists of our 
Chief Risk Officer and other senior executives, develop our 
enterprise statement of risk appetite in the context of our 
risk management framework and culture described above. 
The Board approves our statement of risk appetite 
annually, and the Board™s Risk Committee reviews and 
approves any proposed changes to the statement to help 
ensure that it remains consistent with our risk profile. As part of our review of our risk appetite, we maintain metrics along with associated objectives to measure and monitor the amount of risk that the Company is prepared to 
take. Actual results of these metrics are reported to the 
Enterprise Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis 
as well as to the Risk Committee of the Board. Our operating 
segments also have business-specific risk appetite statements 
based on the enterprise statement of risk appetite. The metrics 
included in the operating segment statements are harmonized 
with the enterprise level metrics to ensure consistency where 
appropriate. Business lines also maintain metrics and 
qualitative statements that are unique to their line of business. 
This allows for monitoring of risk and definition of risk 
appetite deeper within the organization. Our risk culture seeks to promote proactive risk management and puts the customer first by implementing an 
ongoing program of training, performance management, and 
regular communication. Our risk culture also depends on the 
ﬁtone at the topﬂ set by our Board, CEO, and Operating 
Committee members. The Board and the Operating Committee 
are the starting point for establishing and reinforcing our risk 
culture and have overall and ultimate responsibility to provide 
oversight for the three lines of defense and the risks we take. 
The Board and the Operating Committee carry out their 
oversight through governance committees with specific risk 
management responsibilities described below. Board Oversight of Risk The Board allocates its oversight responsibilities across its 
seven standing committees, all of which report to the full 
Board. Each Board committee has defined authorities and 
responsibilities for considering a specific set of risk issues, as 
outlined in each of their charters and as summarized on the 
following chart, and works closely with management to 
understand and oversee the Company™s key risk exposures. 
Allocating risk responsibilities among each Board level 
committee increases the overall amount of attention devoted to 
risk management. The Risk Committee serves as a focal point 
for enterprise-wide risk issues, overseeing all key risks facing 
the Company, and supports and assists the other six Board 
level committees as they consider their specific risk issues. To 
ensure that the Risk Committee does not duplicate the risk 
oversight efforts of other Board committees, the Risk 
Committee includes the Chairs of each of the Board™s other standing committees to provide a comprehensive perspective on risk across the Company and across all individual risk types. 
In addition to providing a forum for risk issues at the Board 
level, the Risk Committee plays an active role in approving and 
overseeing the Company™s enterprise-wide risk management 
framework established by management to manage risk, and the 
functional framework and oversight policies established by 54 management for each key risk type. The Risk Committee also reviews and approves the enterprise statement of risk appetite 
and the enterprise-wide limit structure, and actively monitors 
the risk profile relative to the approved risk appetite. Board of Directors Annually approves overall enterprise risk appetite statement

issues, the Company has established several management-level 
governance committees (governance committees) to support 
Wells Fargo leaders in carrying out their responsibilities to 
manage risk on a daily basis. Each governance committee has a 
defined set of authorities and responsibilities specific to a 
single risk type or set of risk types. Accordingly, risk 
governance committees are responsible for making decisions 
on risk issues in line with each committee™s authorities, or 
escalating issues up the committee structure for further 
consideration. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Wells Fargo Chief Risk Officer, oversees the management 
of all types of risk across the Company. The Enterprise Risk 
Management Committee reports into and escalates matters 
directly to the Board™s Risk Committee, and as such serves as 
the focal point for risk governance and monitoring at the 
management level. The Enterprise Risk Management 
Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the 
Company™s risk profile relative to its risk appetite across risk 
types, businesses, and activities; providing active oversight of 
risk mitigation and the adequacy of risk management 
resources, skills, and capabilities across the enterprise; 
reporting periodically to senior management and the Board on 
the most significant current and emerging risks, risk 
management issues, initiatives, and concerns; and addressing 
key risk issues which are escalated to it by its members or its 
reporting committees. A number of governance committees that are responsible for issues specific to an individual risk type report into the 
Enterprise Risk Management Committee, including the Market 
Risk Committee, the Corporate Model Risk Committee, the 
Counterparty Credit Risk Committee, the Operational Risk 
Management Committee, the Regulatory Compliance Risk 
Management Committee, the BSA/AML (Financial Crimes) 
Risk Committee, the International Oversight Committee, and 
the Legal Entity Governance Committee. Certain of these 
governance committees have dual escalation and/or 
informational reporting paths to the Board level committee 
primarily responsible for the oversight of the specific risk type. The Market Risk Committee is responsible for addressing key market risk management issues related to the Company™s 
trading, hedging, market-making, and investment activities. 
The Corporate Model Risk Committee assists in evaluating and 
managing the Company™s exposure to model risk and conducts 
oversight of the model risk management processes. The 
Counterparty Credit Risk Committee provides broad oversight 
of Wells Fargo™s counterparty risk-taking activities and issuer 
concentration risk. The Operational Risk Management 
Committee™s primary responsibility is to understand 
operational risk issues and concerns and work with 
management across the Company to ensure risks are managed 
effectively. The mandates of the Regulatory Compliance Risk 
Management Committee and the BSA/AML (Financial Crimes) 
Risk Committee are to provide forums through which material 
regulatory compliance and BSA/AML risks of the Company, 
respectively, are appropriately identified, communicated, 
escalated, and managed within the Company™s corresponding 
risk management frameworks. The International Oversight Committee provides broad oversight of the Company™s foreign risk exposure to ensure it is 
consistent with the overall risk appetite of the Company. The 
Legal Entity Governance Committee provides executive 
leadership and oversight of the legal entity lifecycle framework 
and related corporate policies. While the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and the committees that report to it serve as the focal point for the 
management of enterprise-wide risk issues, the management of 
specific risk types is supported by additional management-level 
governance committees. These committees include the SOX 
Disclosure Committee, the Regulatory Reporting Oversight 
Committee, the Capital Reporting Sub-committee, which all 
report to the Board™s Audit & Examination Committee; the 
Stress Testing Committee, the Corporate Asset and Liability 
Committee, the Economic Scenario Approval Committee, 
which all report to the Board™s Finance Committee; the 
Allowance for Credit Losses Approval Committee, which 
reports to the Board™s Credit Committee; and the Incentive 
Compensation Committee and the Employee Benefit Review 
Committee, which both report to the Board™s Human 
Resources Committee. These committees help management facilitate enterprise-wide understanding and monitoring of risks and challenges 
faced by the Company. Management™s corporate risk 
organization, which is part of the second line of defense, is 
headed by the Company™s Chief Risk Officer who, among other 
things, provides oversight, opines on the performance and 
strategy of all risks taken by the businesses, and provides 
credible challenge to risks incurred. The Chief Risk Officer, as 
well as the Chief Enterprise, Credit, Market, Compliance, 
Operational, Information Security and Financial Crimes Risk 
Officers as his or her direct reports, work closely with the 
Board™s committees and frequently provide reports and 
updates to the committees and the committee chairs on risk 
issues during and outside of regular committee meetings, as 
appropriate. The full Board receives reports at each of its 
meetings from the committee chairs about committee 
activities, including risk oversight matters, and receives a 
quarterly report from the Enterprise Risk Management 
Committee regarding current or emerging risk issues. 56 Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal controls and processes, people and systems, or 
resulting from external events. These losses may be caused by 
events such as fraud, breaches of customer privacy, business 
disruptions, inappropriate employee behavior, vendors that do 
not perform their responsibilities and regulatory fines and 
penalties. To address these risks, Wells Fargo maintains an operational risk management framework that includes the 
following objectives: 
Ł Provide a structured approach for identifying, measuring, 
managing, reporting, and monitoring operational risks 
across all areas of Wells Fargo; Ł Understand operational risk across the Company by 
establishing and maintaining an effective operational risk 
management program; Ł Adequately control operational risk-related losses; Ł Establish and hold an appropriate level of capital for such 
losses in accordance with regulatory guidance; and Ł Support the Board as it carries out its oversight duties and 
responsibilities relating to management™s establishment of 
an effective operational risk management program. Wells Fargo™s operational risk management program seeks to accomplish these objectives by managing operational risk across the Company in a comprehensive, interconnected, and 
consistent manner, in line with the enterprise statement of risk 
appetite and relevant regulatory requirements. The Audit & Examination Committee of the Board (A&E Committee) has primary responsibility for oversight of 
operational risk. In this capacity it reviews and approves the 
operational risk management framework and significant 
supporting risk policies and programs, including the 
Company™s business continuity, information security, and third 
party risk management policies and programs. The A&E 
Committee periodically reviews updates from management on 
the state of operational risk and the general condition of 
operational risk management in the Company. At the management level, the Operational Risk Management Committee oversees operational risk 
management across the Company and informs and advises the 
Chief Operational Risk Officer on matters that affect the 
Company's operational risk profile. Information security is a significant operational risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and includes the risk 
of losses resulting from cyber attacks. Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions continue to be the target of various 
evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware and 
denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations 
of financial institutions, potentially test their cybersecurity 
capabilities, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other 
information. Wells Fargo has not experienced any material 
losses relating to these or other cyber attacks. Addressing 
cybersecurity risks is a priority for Wells Fargo, and we 
continue to develop and enhance our controls, processes and 
systems in order to protect our networks, computers, software 
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. We are 
also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and 
working with other parties, including our third-party service 
providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats. See 
the ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ section in this Report for additional 
information regarding the risks associated with a failure or 
breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, 
including as a result of cyber attacks. 57 € € €Credit Risk Management We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with 
many of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. The following discussion focuses 
on our loan portfolios, which represent the largest component of 
assets on our balance sheet for which we have credit risk. 
Table€16 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio 
segment and class of financing receivable. Table 16:€Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and 
Class of Financing Receivable Dec 31, Dec 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 Commercial: Commercial and industrial $ 271,795 235,358 Real estate mortgage 111,996 112,427 Real estate construction 18,728 16,934 Lease financing 12,307 12,371 Total commercial 414,826 377,090 Consumer: Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage 265,386 258,507 Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage 59,717 65,950 Credit card 31,119 26,882 Automobile 55,740 50,808 Other revolving credit and installment 35,763 43,049 Total consumer 447,725 445,196 Total loans $ 862,551 822,286 We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including:€
Ł Loan concentrations and related credit quality Ł Counterparty credit risk Ł Economic and market conditions Ł Legislative or regulatory mandates Ł Changes in interest rates Ł Merger and acquisition activities Ł Reputation risk Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for decentralized management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process 
includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit 
underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and 
modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual 
loan review and audit process. A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. Credit Quality Overview Credit quality continued to improve during 2014 due in part to improving economic conditions, in 
particular the housing market, as well as our proactive credit risk 
management activities. The improvement occurred for both 
commercial and consumer portfolios as evidenced by their credit 
metrics: 
Ł Nonaccrual loans decreased to $2.2 billion and $10.6 billion 

in our commercial and consumer portfolios, respectively, at 
December€31, 2014, from $3.5 billion and $12.2 billion at 

December€31, 2013. Nonaccrual loans represented 1.49% of 

total loans at December€31, 2014, compared with 1.91% at 

December€31, 2013. 
Ł Net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans 
improved to 0.35% in 2014 compared with 0.56% a year ago 

and were 0.01% and 0.65% in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, compared with 0.06% 

and 0.98% in 2013. Ł Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90€days or more past due and still accruing decreased to 
$47€million and $873 million in our commercial and 

consumer portfolios, respectively, at December€31, 2014, 

from $143 million and $902 million at December€31, 2013. 
In addition to credit metric improvements, we continued to see improvement in various economic indicators such as home prices that influenced our evaluation of the allowance and 
provision for credit losses. Accordingly: 
Ł Our provision for credit losses decreased to $1.4 billion in 

2014 from $2.3 billion in 2013. 
Ł The allowance for credit losses decreased to $13.2 billion or 

1.53% of total loans, at December€31, 2014 from 

$15.0€billion or 1.82% of total loans, at December€31, 2013. 
Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit quality trends follows. Non-Strategic and Liquidating Loan Portfolios We continually evaluate and, when appropriate, modify our credit policies to address appropriate levels of risk. We may designate 
certain portfolios and loan products as non-strategic or 
liquidating after which we cease their continued origination and 
actively work to limit losses and reduce our exposures. Table 17 identifies our non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios. They consist primarily of the Pick-a-Pay mortgage 
portfolio and PCI loans acquired from Wachovia, certain 
portfolios from legacy Wells Fargo Home Equity and 
Wells€Fargo Financial, and our education finance government 
guaranteed loan portfolio. We transferred the government 
guaranteed student loan portfolio to loans held for sale at the 
end of second quarter 2014, and substantially all of the portfolio 

strategic and liquidating loan portfolios has decreased 68% since 

the merger with Wachovia at December 31, 2008, and decreased 
25% from the end of 2013. Additional information regarding the liquidating PCI and Pick-a-Pay loan portfolios is provided in the discussion of loan 
portfolios that follows. 58 € Table 17:€Non-Strategic and Liquidating Loan Portfolios

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all 
contractually required principal and interest payments are PCI 
loans. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the 
Wachovia acquisition on December 31, 2008. PCI loans are 
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the 
historical allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not 
carried over. The carrying value of PCI loans totaled 
$23.3€billion at December€31, 2014, down from $26.7 billion and 

$58.8 billion at December€31, 2013 and 2008, respectively. Such 

loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. The accretable yield at December€31, 2014, was $17.8 billion.€
A nonaccretable difference is established for PCI loans to absorb losses expected on those loans at the date of acquisition. Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect 
the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Substantially all commercial and industrial and commercial real estate (CRE) PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. 
Conversely, Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been 
aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics. 
Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single 
composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash 
flows. Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or 
foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an 
individual PCI loan from a pool based on comparing the amount 
received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any 
difference between these amounts is absorbed by the 
nonaccretable difference. This removal method assumes that the 
amount received from resolution approximates pool 
performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is 
unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective 
yield for the remaining loans in the pool are addressed by our 
quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there is no difference between the amount received at resolution and the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be deemed TDRs. Modified PCI loans that are accounted for 
individually are TDRs, and removed from PCI accounting, if 
there has been a concession granted in excess of the original 
nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in our 
impaired loans. During 2014, we recognized as income $61 million released 
from the nonaccretable difference related to commercial PCI 
loans due to payoffs and other resolutions. We also transferred 
$2.2 billion from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable 

yield for PCI loans with improving credit-related cash flows and 
recognized $31 million 
for recoveries of previous write-downs. Our cash flows expected to be collected have been favorably 
affected by lower than expected defaults and losses as a result of 
observed economic strengthening, particularly in housing prices, 
and by our loan modification efforts. Table 18 provides an 
analysis of changes in the nonaccretable difference. 59 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) Table 18:€Changes in Nonaccretable Difference for PCI Loans

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews€Measuring and monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks 
delinquencies, collateral values, FICO scores, economic trends 
by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios 
(typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our 
credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early 
identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each 
of the following portfolios. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease€financing according to€market segmentation and€standard industry codes.€We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned 
to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized divided between special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio totaled $284.1€billion or 33% of total loans at 
December€31, 2014. The net charge-off rate for this portfolio was 

0.10% in 2014 compared with 0.15% in 2013. At December€31, 

2014, 0.20% of this portfolio was nonaccruing, compared with 

0.32% at December€31, 2013.€In addition, $16.7€billion of this 

portfolio was rated as criticized in accordance with regulatory 
guidance at December€31, 2014, compared with $17.5€billion at 

December€31, 2013.€
A majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and securities, as well as long-
lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. Table 20 provides a breakout of commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry, and includes $45.0 billion 

of foreign loans at December 31, 2014, that were reported in a 
separate foreign loan class in prior periods. Foreign loans totaled 
$14.9 billion within the investors category, $18.1 billion within 
the financial institutions category and $1.3 billion within the oil 
and gas category. The investors category includes loans to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) formed by sponsoring entities to invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial and 
residential real estate or corporate cash flow, and are repaid 

from the asset cash flows or the sale of assets by the SPV. We 
limit loan amounts to a percentage of the value of the underlying 
assets, as determined by us, based primarily on analysis of 
underlying credit risk and other factors such as asset duration and ongoing performance. The $18.1 billion of foreign loans in the financial institutions category were primarily originated by our Global Financial Institutions (GFI) business. GFI has relationships with over 
1,500 financial institutions, many of which are headquartered 
outside the U.S., and for whom we provide a variety of 
relationship focused products and services, including loans 
supporting short-term trade finance and working capital needs. Slightly more than half of our oil and gas loans were to businesses in the exploration and production (E&P) sector. 
Nearly all of these E&P loans are secured by oil and/or gas 
reserves and have underlying borrowing base arrangements 
which include regular (typically semi-annual) 
ﬁredeterminationsﬂ that consider refinements to borrowing 
structure and prices used to determine borrowing limits.€The 
remainder of the oil and gas loans were to midstream and 
services and equipment companies. 61 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) Table 20: Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease

in a separate foreign loan class in prior periods. See Note 6 (Loans and

(2) Includes $75 million PCI loans, which are considered to be accruing due to the 
existence of the accretable yield and not based on consideration given to 

contractual interest payments. 
(3) No other single category had loans in excess of $5.5 billion. 
Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower™s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 
collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 
repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly related to the guarantor™s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor™s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis as well as other lenders™ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor™s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
methodology. In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate the collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support 
of any repayment guarantor. In many cases the strength of the 
guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of 
the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan 
becomes uncertain, including the performance of the guarantor, 
we place the loan on nonaccrual status. As appropriate, we also 
charge the loan down in accordance with our charge-off policies, 
generally to the net realizable value of the collateral securing the 
loan, if any. 62 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)€We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized divided between special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included 
$5.0 billion of foreign CRE loans, totaled $130.7€billion, or 15%, 
of total loans at December€31, 2014, and consisted of 

$112.0€billion of mortgage loans and $18.7€billion of 
construction loans. Foreign loans were not reported in this 
category in prior periods, but in a separate foreign loan class. 
Table 21 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type with 
the related nonaccrual totals. The portfolio is diversified both 
geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of combined CRE loans are in California (28% of Table 21:€CRE Loans by State and Property Type 
the total CRE portfolio), and in Texas and Florida (8% in each 
state). By property type, the largest concentrations are office 
buildings at 27% and apartments at 14% of the portfolio. CRE 
nonaccrual loans totaled 1.3% of the CRE outstanding balance at 
December€31, 2014, compared with 2.1% at December€31, 2013. 

At December€31, 2014, we had $7.9€billion of criticized CRE 

mortgage loans, down from $13.1€billion at December€31, 2013, 
and $949 million of criticized CRE construction loans, down 
from $2.1€billion at December€31, 2013.€
At December€31, 2014, the recorded investment in PCI CRE 
loans totaled $1.4€billion, down from $12.3€billion when 
acquired at December€31,€2008, reflecting principal payments, 
loan resolutions and write-downs.

63 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) FOREIGN LOANS AND COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE€We classify loans for financial statement and certain regulatory purposes as foreign primarily based on whether the borrower™s 
primary address is outside of the United States. At December€31, 

2014, foreign loans totaled $50.6 billion, representing 

approximately 6% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, 
compared with $47.6 billion, or approximately 6% of total 
consolidated loans outstanding, at December€31, 2013. Foreign 

loans were approximately 3% of our consolidated total assets at 
December€31, 2014 and at December€31, 2013. 
Our foreign country risk monitoring process incorporates frequent dialogue with our financial institution customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies, enhanced by centralized 
monitoring of macroeconomic and capital markets conditions in 
the respective countries. We establish exposure limits for each 
country through a centralized oversight process based on 
customer needs, and in consideration of relevant economic, 
political, social, legal, and transfer risks. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure on an ultimate country of risk basis, which is normally based on the 
country of residence of the guarantor or collateral location, and 
is different from the reporting based on the borrower™s primary address. Our largest single foreign country exposure on an 
ultimate risk basis at December€31, 2014, was the United 

Kingdom, which totaled $21.1 billion, or approximately 1% of our 
total assets, and included $5.0 billion of sovereign claims. Our 
United Kingdom sovereign claims arise primarily from deposits 
we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory 
requirements in support of our London branch. We conduct periodic stress tests of our significant country risk exposures, analyzing the direct and indirect impacts on the 
risk of loss from various macroeconomic and capital markets 
scenarios. We do not have significant exposure to foreign 
country risks because our foreign portfolio is relatively small. 
However, we have identified exposure to increased loss from 
U.S. borrowers associated with the potential impact of a regional 
or worldwide economic downturn on the U.S. economy. We 
mitigate these potential impacts on the risk of loss through our 
normal risk management processes which include active 
monitoring and, if necessary, the application of aggressive loss 
mitigation strategies. Table 22 provides information regarding our top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) and our Eurozone 
exposure, on an ultimate risk basis. 64 Table 22:€Select Country Exposures

customers in Jersey, C.I. and the Netherlands, and $1.8 billion in defeased leases secured largely by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, or government 

guaranteed. 
(2) Represents issuer exposure on cross-border debt and equity securities. 
(3) Represents counterparty exposure on foreign exchange and derivative contracts, and securities resale and lending agreements. This exposure is presented net of 

counterparty netting adjustments and reduced by the amount of cash collateral. It includes credit default swaps (CDS) predominantly used to manage our U.S. and 

London-based cash credit trading businesses, which sometimes results in selling and purchasing protection on the identical reference entity. Generally, we do not use 

market instruments such as CDS to hedge the credit risk of our investment or loan positions, although we do use them to manage risk in our trading businesses. At 

December€31, 2014, the gross notional amount of our CDS sold that reference assets in the Top 20 or Eurozone countries was $3.3 billion, which was offset by the notional 

amount of CDS purchased of $3.4 billion. We did not have any CDS purchased or sold that reference pools of assets that contain sovereign debt or where the reference 

asset was solely the sovereign debt of a foreign country. 
(4) For countries presented in the table, total non-sovereign exposure comprises $20.9 billion exposure to financial institutions and $36.4 billion to non-financial corporations 

at December€31, 2014.

$ 324,457 100% 
The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only 
loans were approximately 12% and 15% of total loans at 
December€31, 2014 and December€31, 2013, respectively. We 

believe we have manageable adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our owned mortgage loan portfolios. We do not 
offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate 
mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly 
referred to within the financial services industry as negative 
amortizing mortgage loans. The option ARMs we do have are 
included in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio which was acquired from 
Wachovia and are part of our liquidating loan portfolios. Since 
our acquisition of the Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio at the end of 
2008, the option payment portion of the portfolio has reduced 
from 86% to 41% at December€31, 2014, as a result of our 

modification activities and customers exercising their option to 

a-Pay Portfolioﬂ section later in this Report. We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulties. Loans are underwritten at the time of the 
modification in accordance with underwriting guidelines 
established for governmental and proprietary loan modification 
programs. As a participant in the U.S. Treasury™s Making Home 
Affordable (MHA) programs, we are focused on helping 
customers stay in their homes. The MHA programs create a 
standardization of modification terms including incentives paid 
to borrowers, servicers, and investors. MHA includes the Home 
Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) for first lien loans and 
the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP) for junior lien 
loans. Under both our proprietary programs and the MHA 
programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate 
reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, 
principal forgiveness. These programs generally include trial 
payment periods of three to four months, and after successful 
completion and compliance with terms during this period, the 
loan is permanently modified. Once the loan is modified either through a permanent modification or a trial period, it is 
accounted for as a TDR. See the ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ 
Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ section in this Report for 
discussion on how we determine the allowance attributable to 
our modified residential real estate portfolios. Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values (LTV/ 
CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators, which exclude government 
insured/guaranteed loans, continued to improve in fourth 
quarter 2014 on the non-PCI mortgage portfolio. Loans 30 days 

or more delinquent at December€31, 2014, totaled $10.2 billion, 

or 3%, of total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $11.9 billion, 
or 4%, at December€31, 2013. Loans with FICO scores lower than 

640 totaled $25.8 billion at December€31, 2014, or 9% of total 

non-PCI mortgages, compared with $31.5 billion, or 10%, at 
December€31, 2013. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 

100% totaled $20.3 billion at December€31, 2014, or 7% of total 

non-PCI mortgages, compared with $34.3 billion, or 11%, at 
December€31, 2013. Information regarding credit risk indicators, 

including PCI credit risk indicators, can be found in Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. Real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans by state are presented in Table 24. Our real estate 1-4 family 
mortgage loans to borrowers in California represented 
approximately 13% of total loans at December€31, 2014, located 

mostly within the larger metropolitan areas, with no single 
California metropolitan area consisting of more than 4% of total 
loans. We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
loans secured by residential real estate collateral includes 
appraisals or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a 
lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of 66 €€ large numbers of properties in a short period of time using market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The 
primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of 
an individual property may vary significantly from the average 
for the market area. We have processes to periodically validate 
AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the 
circumstances when AVMs may be used. AVMs are generally 
used in underwriting to support property values on loan 
originations only where the loan amount is under $250,000. We 
generally require property visitation appraisals by a qualified 
independent appraiser for larger residential property loans. 
Additional information about AVMs and our policy for their use 
can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. Table 24:€Real Estate 1-4 Family First and Junior Lien

67 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) First Lien Mortgage Portfolio The credit performance associated with our real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage portfolio continued to improve in 2014, as measured through net 

charge-offs and nonaccrual loans. Net charge-offs as a 
percentage of average total loans improved to 0.19% in 2014, 

compared with 0.47% in 2013. Nonaccrual loans were 

$8.6€billion at December€31, 2014, compared with $9.8 billion at 
December€31, 2013. Improvement in the credit performance was 

driven by both an improving economic and housing environment Table 25: First Lien Mortgage Portfolios Performance (1) and declining balances in non-strategic and liquidating loans, 
which have been replaced with higher quality assets originated 
after 2008 utilizing tighter underwriting standards. Real estate 
1-4 family first lien mortgage loans originated after 2008 have 
resulted in minimal losses to date and were approximately 60% 
of our total real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage portfolio as 
of December€31, 2014. First lien mortgage portfolios by state are 

presented in Table 25. Outstanding balance % of loans two payments or more past due Loss rate (in millions) Dec 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2013 Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 Core portfolio: California New York

In 2014, we continued to grow our real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage portfolio through the retention of high-quality non-conforming mortgages. Substantially all non-conforming 
loans originated in 2014 were classified as non-conforming due 

to the loan amount exceeding conventional conforming loan 
amount limits established by federal government-sponsored 
entities (GSEs). Our total real estate 1-4 family first lien 
mortgage portfolio increased $6.9 billion in 2014. The growth in 

this portfolio has been largely offset by runoff in our real estate 
1-4 family first lien mortgage non-strategic and liquidating 
portfolios. Excluding this runoff, our core real estate 1-4 family 
first lien mortgage portfolio increased $14.4 billion, as we 
retained $42.3 billion in non-conforming originations, primarily 
consisting of loans that exceed GSE lending limits, in 2014. 
68 €€Pick-a-Pay Portfolio The Pick-a-Pay portfolio was one of the consumer residential first mortgage portfolios we acquired from Wachovia and a majority of the portfolio was identified as PCI 
loans. The Pick-a-Pay portfolio includes loans that offer payment options (Pick-a-Pay option payment loans), and also includes 
loans that were originated without the option payment feature, 
loans that no longer offer the option feature as a result of our 
modification efforts since the acquisition, and loans where the 

a-Pay portfolio is included in the consumer real estate 1-4 family 
first mortgage class of loans throughout this Report. Table 26 Table 26:€Pick-a-Pay Portfolio - Comparison to Acquisition Date 
provides balances by types of loans as of December 31, 2014, as a 
result of modification efforts, compared to the types of loans 
included in the portfolio at acquisition. Total adjusted unpaid 
principal balance of PCI Pick-a-Pay loans was $26.3 billion at 

December€31, 2014, compared with $61.0 billion at acquisition. 

Primarily due to modification efforts, the adjusted unpaid 
principal balance of option payment PCI loans has declined to 
16% of the total Pick-a-Pay portfolio at December€31, 2014, 

compared with 51% at acquisition. December 31,€December 31, 2014 2008 Adjusted Adjusted unpaid unpaid principal principal (in millions) balance (1)€% of total€balance (1)€% of total€Option payment loans $ 20,258 41%

options). Total interest deferred due to negative amortization on 
Pick-a-Pay loans was $606€million at December€31, 2014, and 

$902 million at December 31, 2013. Approximately 95% of the 
Pick-a-Pay customers making a minimum payment in 
December€2014 did not defer interest, compared with 93% in 
December 2013.€Deferral of interest on a Pick-a-Pay loan may continue as long as the loan balance remains below a pre-defined principal 
cap, which is based on the percentage that the current loan 
balance represents to the original loan balance. A significant 
portion of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio has a cap of 125% of the 
original loan balance. Most of the Pick-a-Pay loans on which 
there is a deferred interest balance re-amortize (the monthly 
payment amount is reset or ﬁrecastﬂ) on the earlier of the date 
when the loan balance reaches its principal cap, or generally the 
10-year anniversary of the loan. After a recast, the customers™ 
new payment terms are reset to the amount necessary to repay 
the balance over the remainder of the original loan term. Due to the terms of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, any remaining recast risk is covered through our allowance for credit losses and 
nonaccretable difference. Based on assumptions of a flat rate 
environment, if all eligible customers elect the minimum 
payment option 100% of the time and no balances prepay, we 
would expect the following balances of loans to recast based on 
reaching the principal cap and also experiencing a payment 
change over the annual 7.5% reset: $56€million in 2015, 
$29€million in 2016, $26 million in 2017, $0.4 million in 2018 
and $0.2 million in 2019. In addition, in a flat rate environment, 
we would expect the following balances of loans to start fully 
amortizing due to reaching their recast anniversary date and also 
having a payment change over the annual 7.5% reset: 
$339€million in 2015, $395 million in 2016, $1,496 million in 
2017, $208 million in 2018 and $4 million in 2019. In 2014, the amount of loans reaching their recast anniversary date and also 
having a payment change over the annual 7.5% reset was 
$96€million.€Table 27 reflects the geographic distribution of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio broken out between PCI loans and all other loans. 
The LTV ratio is a useful metric in predicting future real estate 
1-4 family first mortgage loan performance, including potential 
charge-offs. Because PCI loans were initially recorded at fair 
value, including write-downs for expected credit losses, the ratio 
of the carrying value to the current collateral value will be lower 
compared with the LTV based on the adjusted unpaid principal 
balance. For informational purposes, we have included both 
ratios for PCI loans in the following table. 69  Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) Table 27: Pick-a-Pay Portfolio

(2) Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial 
stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan. 
(3) The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated 

valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market 

data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas. 
(4) Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the 

nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-

offs. (5) The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value. 
To maximize return and allow flexibility for customers to avoid foreclosure, we have in place several loss mitigation 
strategies for our Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio. We contact 
customers who are experiencing financial difficulty and may in 
certain cases modify the terms of a loan based on a customer™s 
documented income and other circumstances. We also have taken steps to work with customers to refinance or restructure their Pick-a-Pay loans into other loan products. 
For customers at risk, we offer combinations of term extensions 
of up to 40 years (from 30 years), interest rate reductions, 
forbearance of principal, and, in certain cases we may offer 
principal forgiveness to customers with substantial property 
value declines based on affordability needs. In 2014, we completed more than 5,300 proprietary and Home Affordability Modification Program (HAMP) Pick-a-Pay 
loan modifications. We have completed nearly 130,000 modifications since the Wachovia acquisition, resulting in $6.0 billion of principal forgiveness to our Pick-a-Pay customers. There remains $30 million of conditional forgiveness that can be 
earned by borrowers through performance over a three year period. Due to better than expected performance observed on the Pick-a-Pay PCI portfolio compared with the original acquisition estimates, we have reclassified $6.0 billion from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield since acquisition. Our cash flows expected to be collected have been favorably affected by lower expected defaults and losses as a result of observed and forecasted economic strengthening, particularly in housing prices, and our loan modification efforts. These factors 
are expected to reduce the frequency and severity of defaults and 
keep these loans performing for a longer period, thus increasing 
future principal and interest cash flows. The resulting increase in 
the accretable yield will be realized over the remaining life of the 
portfolio, which is estimated to have a weighted-average 
remaining life of approximately 11.7€years at December€31, 2014, 

down from 12.7 years at December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting 
the passage of time. The accretable yield percentage at 
December€31, 2014 was 6.15%, up from 4.98% at the end of 2013 

due to favorable changes in the expected timing and composition of cash flows resulting from improving credit and prepayment 
expectations. Fluctuations in the accretable yield are driven by 
changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, 
prepayment assumptions, and expected principal and interest 
payments over the estimated life of the portfolio, which will be 
affected by the pace and degree of improvements in the U.S. 
economy and housing markets and projected lifetime 
performance resulting from loan modification activity. Changes 
in the projected timing of cash flow events, including loan 
liquidations, modifications and short sales, can also affect the 
accretable yield rate and the estimated weighted-average life of 
the portfolio. The predominant portion of our PCI loans is included in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. For further information on the judgment 
involved in estimating expected cash flows for PCI loans,€see the 
ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ Purchased Credit-Impaired Loansﬂ section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio The junior lien mortgage portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, interest only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar features. The majority of our junior lien loan products are amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit performance of our junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of loss. We have observed 
that the severity of loss for junior lien mortgages is high and 
generally not affected by whether we or a third party own or 
service the related first mortgage, but the frequency of 
delinquency is typically lower when we own or service the first 
lien mortgage. In general, we have limited information available 
on the delinquency status of the third party owned or serviced 
senior lien where we also hold a junior lien. To capture this 
inherent loss content, we use the experience of our junior lien

We monitor the number of borrowers paying the minimum amount due on a monthly basis. In December 2014, approximately 94% of our borrowers with a junior lien mortgage 
outstanding balance paid the minimum amount due or more, 
including approximately 47% who paid only the minimum 
amount due. Table 29 shows the credit attributes of the core and liquidating junior lien mortgage portfolios and lists the top five 
states by outstanding balance for the core portfolio. Loans to 
California borrowers represent the largest state concentration in 
each of these portfolios. The decrease in outstanding balances 
since December 31, 2013 predominantly reflects loan paydowns. 
As of December 31, 2014, 20% of the outstanding balance of the 
junior lien mortgage portfolio was associated with loans that had Table 29:€Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolios (1) a combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of 
those junior mortgage liens with a CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 
3.03% were two payments or more past due as of 
December€31,€2014. CLTV means the ratio of the total loan 
balance of first mortgages and junior lien mortgages (including 
unused line amounts for credit line products) to property 
collateral value. The unsecured portion (the outstanding amount 
that was in excess of the most recent property collateral value) of 
the outstanding balances of these loans totaled 8% of the junior

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit products the draw period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding generally have a draw period of 10 years (with some up to 15 or principal balance plus accrued interest. During the draw period, 20 years) with variable interest rate and payment options during the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the 71 €€€€Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a fixed period between 
three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed 
period between five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a 
line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment 
schedule with repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the 
balance at time of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been 
structured with a balloon payment, which requires full 
repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term 
period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or 
balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase, 
which can affect some borrowers™ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. The lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the
 ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in 
an effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. Table 30 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of junior lien lines and loans and senior lien lines segregated into 
scheduled end of draw or end of term periods and products that 
are currently amortizing, or in balloon repayment status. It 
excludes real estate 1-4 family first lien line reverse mortgages, 
which total $2.3 billion, because they are predominantly insured 
by the FHA, and it excludes PCI loans, which total $130 million, 
because their losses were generally reflected in our 
nonaccretable difference established at the date of acquisition. Table 30: Junior Lien Mortgage Line and Loan and Senior Lien Mortgage Line Portfolios Payment Schedule

(1) The annual scheduled end of draw or term ranges from $1.7 billion to $10.0 billion and averages $5.3 billion per year for 2020 and thereafter. The loans that convert in 

2025 and thereafter have draw periods that generally extend to 15 or 20 years. 
(2) Junior loans within the term period predominantly represent principal and interest products that require a balloon payment upon the end of the loan term. Amortizing junior 

loans include $62 million of balloon loans that have reached end of term and are now past due. 
(3) Lines in their draw period are predominantly interest-only. The unfunded credit commitments total $70.1 billion at December 31, 2014. 
(4) Includes scheduled end-of-term balloon payments totaling $455 million, $386 million, $501 million, $518 million, $445 million, and $1.9 billion for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 

2019, 2020 and thereafter, respectively. Amortizing lines include $189 million of end-of-term balloon payments, which are past due. At December 31, 2014, $425 million, 

or 7% of outstanding lines of credit that are amortizing, are 30 or more days past due compared to $1.3 billion, or 2% for lines in their draw period. 
CREDIT CARDS Our credit card portfolio totaled $31.1 billion at 
December€31, 2014, which represented 4% of our total 

outstanding loans. In November 2014, we purchased an existing 
private label and co-branded credit card loan portfolio in 
connection with the Dillard's program agreement. The net 
charge-off rate for our credit card portfolio was 3.14% for 2014, 

compared with 3.62% for 2013. 
AUTOMOBILE Our automobile portfolio, predominantly composed of indirect loans, totaled $55.7 billion at December€31, 

2014. The net charge-off rate for our automobile portfolio was 

0.70% for 2014, compared with 0.63% for 2013.€
OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT Other revolving credit and installment loans totaled $35.8 billion at 

December€31, 2014, and primarily included student and security-

based loans. Student loans totaled $11.9 billion at December€31, 

2014, compared with $22.0 billion at December€31, 2013, 

reflecting the transfer of $9.7 billion in government guaranteed 
student loans to loans held for sale at June€30, 2014, of which 

$8.3 billion were sold in fourth quarter 2014. The net charge-off 
rate for other revolving credit and installment loans was 1.35% 

for 2014, compared with 1.41% for 2013. 
72  €€€NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS) Table 31 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for each of the last five years. We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
Ł the full and timely collection of interest or principal 
becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower™s financial condition and the adequacy of 
collateral, if any); Ł they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 
family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest 
or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of 
collection; Ł part of the principal balance has been charged off (including 
loans discharged in bankruptcy); Ł for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 
process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status; or Ł performing consumer loans are discharged in bankruptcy, 
regardless of their delinquency status. Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Œ Loans) to Financial Statements in this Report describes our accounting policy for nonaccrual and impaired loans. Table 31: Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that 
are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance 
and an improvement in the borrower™s financial condition and 
loan repayment capabilities. Also, reductions can come from 
borrower repayments even if the loan remains on nonaccrual. While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we believe exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the 
following factors at December€31, 2014: 

Ł 98% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 

consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 98% are secured by real estate and 72% 

have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. Ł losses of $495 million and $3.5 billion have already been 

recognized on 29% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 53% 

of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively. Generally, when 
a consumer real estate loan is 120 days past due (except 
when required earlier by guidance issued by bank regulatory 
agencies), we transfer it to nonaccrual status. When the loan 
reaches 180 days past due, or is discharged in bankruptcy, it 
is our policy to write these loans down to net realizable 
value (fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell), 
except for modifications in their trial period that are not 
written down as long as trial payments are made on time. 
Thereafter, we reevaluate each loan regularly and record 
additional write-downs if needed. Ł 71% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 

interest. Ł the risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been considered 
and we believe is adequately covered by the allowance for 
loan losses. Ł $2.0 billion of consumer loans discharged in bankruptcy 

and classified as nonaccrual were 60 days or less past due, 
of which $1.9 billion were current. 
We continue to work with our customers experiencing financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under both 
our proprietary modification programs and the MHA programs, 
customers may be required to provide updated documentation, 
and some programs require completion of payment during trial 
periods to demonstrate sustained performance before the loan 
can be removed from nonaccrual status. In addition, for loans in 
foreclosure in certain states, including New York and New 
Jersey, the foreclosure timeline has significantly increased due 
to backlogs in an already complex process. Therefore, some 
loans may remain on nonaccrual status for a long period. If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that were, but are no longer on nonaccrual at year end) had been 
accrued under the original terms, approximately $741 million of 

interest would have been recorded as income on these loans, 
compared with $598 million actually recorded as interest 

income in 2014, versus $764 million and $575 million, 

respectively, in 2013. Table 34 provides a summary of foreclosed assets and an analysis of changes in foreclosed assets. 75 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) Table 34: Foreclosed Assets

Balance, end of period $ 2,609 2,831 3,005 3,422 2,609 3,937 (1) During fourth quarter 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-14, 
Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure, effective as of January€1, 2014. This ASU requires that government guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans that meet specific criteria be recognized as other 
receivables upon foreclosure; previously, these assets were included in foreclosed assets. Government guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans that completed 

foreclosure during 2014 and met the criteria specified by ASU 2014-14 totaled $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion, and $693 million at September€30, 2014, June€30, 2014, and 

March€31, 2014, respectively, and are excluded from this table. For more information on the changes in foreclosures for government guaranteed residential real estate 

mortgage loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 7 (Premises, Equipment, Lease Commitments and Other Assets). 
(2) Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. The net change 

in government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets is made up of inflows from mortgages held for investment and MHFS, and outflows when we are reimbursed by FHA/ 

VA. Transfers from government insured/guaranteed loans to foreclosed assets amounted to $45 million, $41 million, $43 million, and $62 million for the quarters ended 

December 31, September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2014 and $191 million and $2.9 billion for the years ended December€31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amounts 

previously reported for the quarterly net change in government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets have been revised to exclude $375 million, $409 million and 

$693€million at September€30, 2014, June€30, 2014, and March€31, 2014, respectively, to reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-14. 
(3) Predominantly include loans moved into foreclosure from nonaccrual status, PCI loans transitioned directly to foreclosed assets and repossessed automobiles. 
Foreclosed assets at December€31, 2014, included 
$1.6€billion of foreclosed residential real estate that had 

collateralized commercial and consumer loans, of which 59% is 

predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining foreclosed 
assets balance of $1.0 billion has been written down to estimated 

net realizable value. The decrease in foreclosed assets at 
December€31, 2014, compared with December€31, 2013, was the 

result of the adoption of ASU 2014-14, which requires that 
government guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans 
that meet specific criteria be recognized as other receivables 
upon foreclosure (previously, these were included in foreclosed 
assets). Of the $2.6 billion in foreclosed assets at December€31, 

2014, 33% have been in the foreclosed assets portfolio one year 

or less. 76 TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs) Table 35:€Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)

The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $3.6 billion and $4.5 billion at 
December 31,€2014€and 2013, respectively. See Note 6 (Loans 
and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information regarding TDRs. In those 
situations where principal is forgiven, the entire amount of such 
forgiveness is immediately charged off to the extent not done so 
prior to the modification. We sometimes delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal forbearance) and 
charge off the amount of forbearance if that amount is not 
considered fully collectible. Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan types when a restructuring is involved. We re-underwrite loans 
at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is 
sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the 
borrower™s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other 
factors. Loans lacking sufficient evidence of sustained repayment 77 €Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) capacity at the time of modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that 
has been modified, if the borrower has demonstrated 
performance under the previous terms and the underwriting 
process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the 
restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing 
status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual status 
until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of 
performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or 
equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to 
modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual, and a 
corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when Table 37:€Analysis of Changes in TDRs 
we believe that principal and interest contractually due under 
the modified agreement will not be collectible. Table 37 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans that may be modified more than once are reported as TDR 
inflows only in the period they are first modified. Other than 
resolutions such as foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for 
sale, we may remove loans held for investment from TDR 
classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

enter into a permanent modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved. Our experience is that substantially all of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing the program 

requirements. 2013 78  €LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING€Loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal are still accruing if they are (1) well-secured and in the process of 
collection or (2) real estate 
mortgage loans or 
consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans are not included in past due and still 
accruing loans even though they are 90 days or more 
contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be 
accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable 
yield, independent of performance in accordance with their 
contractual terms. Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2014, were down 
$125 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2013, due to payoffs, Table 38:€Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing 

strategic and liquidating portfolios, and credit stabilization. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or 
guaranteed by the VA for mortgages and the U.S. Department of 
Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education

(1) Quarterly net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 
Table 39 presents net charge-offs for the four quarters and full year of 2014 and 2013. Net charge-offs in 2014 were $2.9€billion (0.35% of average total loans outstanding) compared with $4.5 billion (0.56%) in 2013. We continued to have strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate secured portfolios. Our commercial real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position every quarter in 2014 and 2013. Our consumer real estate portfolios continued to benefit from the improvement in the housing market with losses down $1.4€billion, or 55%, from 2013. 80 €ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The allowance for credit losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management™s 
estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans carried at fair value. The detail of the changes in 
the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including 
charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This 
process takes into consideration many factors, including 
historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality Table 40: Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 
ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process 
involves subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we 
review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit 
metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the 
amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools. For 
additional information on our allowance for credit losses, see the 
ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ 
section and€Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) 
and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. Table 40 presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan segment and class for the last five years.

December€31,€2013, of nonaccretable difference to absorb losses 
for PCI loans. The allowance for credit losses is lower than 
otherwise would have been required without PCI loan 
accounting. As a result of PCI loans, certain ratios of the 
Company may not be directly comparable with credit-related 
metrics for other financial institutions. For additional 
information on PCI loans, see the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Management Œ Purchased Credit-Impaired Loansﬂ section, 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.€The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to 
period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the 
portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and 
marketability of collateral. Substantially all of our nonaccrual 81 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) loans were real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans at December 31, 2014. The allowance for credit losses again declined in 2014, which reflected continued credit improvement, particularly in 
residential real estate and primarily associated with continued 
improvement in the housing market. The total provision for 
credit losses was $1.4€billion in 2014, $2.3€billion in 2013 and 
$7.2€billion in 2012. The 2014 provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, $1.6€billion less than net charge-offs, due to strong underlying 
credit, and improvement in the housing market. The 2013 provision was $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion less than net charge-offs, and the 2012 provision was $7.2€billion, 
$1.8€billion less than net charge-offs. In each of 2013 and 2012 
the provision was influenced by continually improving credit 
performance. We believe the allowance for credit losses of $13.2€billion at December€31,€2014, was appropriate to cover credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at that date. The allowance for credit losses is 
subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of 
determination, including economic or market conditions and 
ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the 
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in the 
economic and business environment, it is possible that we will 
incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance 
sheet date. Future allowance levels may increase or decrease 
based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio 
performance and general economic conditions. Our process for 
determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the 
ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ 
section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 82   LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES€We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage 
loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may 
be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice 
of the breach. The majority of repurchase demands are on loans 
that default in the first 24 to 36 months following origination of 
the mortgage loan. In connection with our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a 
mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to 
various representations and warranties that reflect 
management™s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently 
service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our 
mortgage repurchase liability estimation process also 
incorporates a forecast of repurchase demands associated with 
mortgage insurance rescission activity. Because we retain the servicing for most of the mortgage loans we sell or securitize, we believe the quality of our 
residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio provides helpful 
information in evaluating our repurchase liability. Of the 
$1.8€trillion in the residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
at December 31, 2014, 94% was current and less than 2% was 
subprime at origination. Our combined delinquency and 
foreclosure rate on this portfolio was 5.79% at 
December€31,€2014, compared with 6.40% at December 31, 2013. 
Three percent of this portfolio is private label securitizations for 
which we originated the loans and therefore have some 
repurchase risk. The overall level of unresolved repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescissions outstanding at 
December€31,€2014, was down from a year ago both in number of 
outstanding loans and in total dollar balances as we continued to 
work through the new demands and mortgage insurance 
rescissions and as we announced settlements with both Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal 
National Mortgage Association (FNMA) in 2013, that resolved 
substantially all repurchase liabilities associated with loans sold 
to FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009, and loans sold to FNMA 
that were originated prior to January€1, 2009. Demands from 
private investors declined from December 31, 2013 primarily due 
to settlements with two private investors in first quarter 2014 
that resolved many of the increased demands we experienced 
commencing in 2012 and significantly in fourth quarter 2013. Customary with industry practice, we have the right of recourse against correspondent lenders from whom we have 
purchased loans with respect to representations and warranties. 
Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender performance 
are incorporated in the establishment of our mortgage 
repurchase liability. We do not typically receive repurchase requests from GNMA, FHA and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) or VA. As an originator of an FHA-insured 
or VA-guaranteed loan, we are responsible for obtaining the 
insurance with FHA or the guarantee with the VA. To the extent 
we are not able to obtain the insurance or the guarantee we must 
request permission to repurchase the loan from the GNMA pool. 
Such repurchases from GNMA pools typically represent a self-
initiated process upon discovery of the uninsurable loan (usually 
within 180€days from funding of the loan). Alternatively, in lieu 
of repurchasing loans from GNMA pools, we may be asked by 
FHA/HUD or the VA to indemnify them (as applicable) for 
defects found in the Post Endorsement Technical Review process 
or audits performed by FHA/HUD or the VA. The Post 
Endorsement Technical Review is a process whereby HUD 
performs underwriting audits of closed/insured FHA loans for 
potential deficiencies. Our liability for mortgage loan repurchase 
losses incorporates probable losses associated with such 
indemnification. Table 41 provides the number of unresolved repurchase demands and mortgage insurance rescissions. 83 Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) Table 41:€Unresolved Repurchase Demands and Mortgage Insurance Rescissions

$190 million and 674 and $147 million at December 31, September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2014, and December 31, September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2013, respectively, received from investors on mortgage servicing rights acquired from other originators. We generally have the right of recourse against the seller and may be 

able to recover losses related to such repurchase demands subject to counterparty risk associated with the seller. 
(2) As part of our representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we typically represent to GSEs and private investors that certain loans have mortgage insurance 

to the extent there are loans that have loan to value ratios in excess of 80% that require mortgage insurance. To the extent the mortgage insurance is rescinded by the 

mortgage insurer due to a claim of breach of a contractual representation or warranty, the lack of insurance may result in a repurchase demand from an investor. Similar to 

repurchase demands, we evaluate mortgage insurance rescission notices for validity and appeal for reinstatement if the rescission was not based on a contractual breach. 

When investor demands are received due to lack of mortgage insurance, they are reported as unresolved repurchase demands based on the applicable investor category 

for the loan (GSE or private). 
(3) While the original loan balances related to these demands are presented above, the establishment of the repurchase liability is based on a combination of factors, such as 

our appeals success rates, reimbursement by correspondent and other third party originators, and projected loss severity, which is driven by the difference between the 

current loan balance and the estimated collateral value less costs to sell the property. 
Table 42 summarizes the changes in our mortgage $746€million and the $508 million cash payments for the repurchase liability. We incurred net losses on repurchased FHLMC and FNMA settlement agreements, respectively.

FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009. Year ended December 31, 2013, reflects $508 million as a result of the agreement with FNMA that resolves substantially all repurchase 

liabilities related to loans sold to FNMA that were originated prior to January 1, 2009. Our liability for mortgage repurchases, included in ﬁAccrued expenses and other liabilitiesﬂ in our consolidated balance sheet, 
represents our best estimate of the probable loss that we expect 
to incur for various representations and warranties in the 
contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. The 
mortgage repurchase liability estimation process requires 
management to make difficult, subjective and complex 
judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, 
including demand expectations, economic factors, and the 
specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. Our 
evaluation considers all vintages and the collective actions of the 
GSEs and their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
(FHFA), mortgage insurers and our correspondent lenders. We 
maintain regular contact with the GSEs, the FHFA, and other significant investors to monitor their repurchase demand 
practices and issues as part of our process to update our 
repurchase liability estimate as new information becomes 
available. The liability was $615 million at December 31, 2014, 
and $899 million at December 31, 2013. In 2014, we released 
$140 million, which increased net gains on mortgage loan 
origination/sales activities, compared with a provision of 
$428€million in 2013. The release in 2014 was primarily due to a 
re-estimation of our liability based on recently observed trends. Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability 
that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of 
possible loss for representations and warranties does not 84 €represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions 
that are subject to change. The high end of this range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded liability was 
$973 million at December 31, 2014, and was determined based 
upon modifying the assumptions (particularly to assume 
significant changes in investor repurchase demand practices) 
used in our best estimate of probable loss to reflect what we 
believe to be the high end of reasonably possible adverse 
assumptions. Table 43 provides information on the sensitivity of the mortgage repurchase liability estimate to changes in 
assumptions. For additional information on our repurchase 
liability, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. Table 43:€Mortgage Repurchase Liability - Sensitivity

repurchased loans for which no loss is expected to be realized. 
(2) Represents the combination of the estimated investor audit/file review rate, 

the investor demand rate on those audited loans, and the unsuccessful appeal 

rate on those demands. As such, the repurchase rate can be significantly 

impacted by changes in investor behavior if they decide to review/audit more 

loans or demand more repurchases on the loans they audit. These behavior 

changes drive a significant component of our estimated high end of the range 

of reasonably possible losses in excess of our recorded repurchase liability, 

which includes adverse assumptions in excess of the sensitivity ranges 

presented in this table. RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master 
servicer of residential mortgage loans included in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed 
mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as 
for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. The 
following discussion summarizes the primary duties and 
requirements of servicing and related industry developments. General Servicing Duties and Requirements The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage 
loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are typically to 
(1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain 
delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage 
loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary 
mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) 
maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and 
insurance and administer escrow payments, (5) foreclose on 
defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the 
related servicing agreement, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales, and (6) for loans sold 
into private label securitizations, manage the foreclosed property 
through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of 
the mortgage loans by the servicer, (2) consult with each servicer 
and use reasonable efforts to cause the servicer to observe its 
servicing obligations, (3) prepare monthly distribution 
statements to security holders and, if required by the 
securitization documents, certain periodic reports required to be 
filed with the SEC, (4) if required by the securitization 
documents, calculate distributions and loss allocations on the 
mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax and information 
returns of the securitization trust, and (6) advance amounts 
required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their 
advancing obligations. Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity and provides protection against 
expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with 
the specified standard. For example, most private label 
securitization agreements under which we act as servicer or 
master servicer typically provide that the servicer and the master 
servicer are entitled to indemnification by the securitization 
trust for taking action or refraining from taking action in good 
faith or for errors in judgment. However, we are not 
indemnified, but rather are required to indemnify the 
securitization trustee, against any failure by us, as servicer or 
master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or against 
any of our acts or omissions that involve willful misfeasance, bad 
faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless 
disregard of, our duties. In addition, if we commit a material 
breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may 
be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a 
specified period following notice, which can generally be given 
by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security 
holders. Whole loan sale contracts under which we act as 
servicer generally include similar provisions with respect to our 
actions as servicer. The standards governing servicing in GSE-
guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for 
violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and 
remedies are determined by servicing guides maintained by the 
GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and individual servicers and 
topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such 
remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an 
affected mortgage loan. Consent Orders and Settlement Agreements for 
Mortgage Servicing and Foreclosure Practices 
In connection with our servicing activities we have entered into 
various settlements with federal and state regulators to resolve 
certain alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these 
settlements required us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention 
and assistance, as well as imposed certain monetary penalties on 
us. In particular, on February 28, 2013, we entered into amendments to an April 2011 Consent Order with both the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FRB, 
which effectively ceased the Independent Foreclosure Review 
program created by such Consent Order and replaced it with an 
accelerated remediation commitment to provide foreclosure 
prevention actions on $1.2 billion of residential mortgage loans, 
subject to a process to be administered by the OCC and the FRB. 
During 2014, we believe we reported sufficient foreclosure 
prevention actions to the monitor of the accelerated remediation 85   Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) process to meet the $1.2 billion commitment, but are awaiting monitor approval. In addition, on February 9, 2012, a federal/state settlement was announced among the DOJ, HUD, the Department of the 
Treasury, the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Federal Trade 
Commission, the Executive Office of the U.S. Trustee, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a task force of Attorneys 
General, Wells Fargo, and four other servicers related to 
investigations of mortgage industry servicing and foreclosure 
practices. Under the terms of this settlement, we agreed to 
certain programmatic commitments, consisting of three 
components totaling approximately $5.3 billion. As announced 
on March 18, 2014, we have successfully fulfilled our remaining 
commitments (and state-level sub-commitments) in accordance 
with the terms of this settlement. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors (Board), 
which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial 
risk management policies and processes used to assess and 
manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding 
resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. At the 
management level we utilize a Corporate Asset/Liability 
Management Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of 
senior financial, risk, and business executives, to oversee these 
risks and report on them periodically to the Board™s Finance 
Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. Each of our 
principal lines of business has its own asset/liability 
management committee and process linked to the Corporate 
ALCO process. As discussed in more detail for trading activities 
below, we employ separate management level oversight specific 
to market risk. Market risk, in its broadest sense, refers to the 
possibility that losses will result from the impact of adverse 
changes in market rates and prices on our trading and non-
trading portfolios and financial instruments. INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk, which potentially can have a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
Ł assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities 
and interest rates are generally falling, earnings will initially 
decline); Ł assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts (for example, when the general level of 
interest rates is falling, we may reduce rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is 
less than the general decline in market interest rates); Ł short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); Ł the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, MBS held 
in the investment securities portfolio may prepay 
significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce 
portfolio income); or Ł interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on 
loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, the fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments, the value of the pension liability and 
other items affecting earnings. 
We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various earnings simulations using many interest rate scenarios 
that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of 
change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of 
the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions 
regarding how changes in interest rates and related market 
conditions could influence drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan origination demand, prepayment 
speeds, deposit balances and mix, as well as pricing strategies. Our risk measures include both net interest income sensitivity and interest rate sensitive noninterest income and 
expense impacts. We refer to the combination of these exposures 
as interest rate sensitive earnings. In general, the Company is 
positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. Currently, our 
profile is such that net interest income will benefit from higher 
interest rates as our assets reprice faster and to a greater degree 
than our liabilities, and, in response to lower market rates, our 
assets will reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and 
expense is largely driven by mortgage activity, and tends to move 
in the opposite direction of our net interest income. So, in 
response to higher interest rates, mortgage activity, primarily 
refinancing activity, generally declines. And in response to lower 
rates, mortgage activity generally increases. Mortgage results are 
also impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge 
positions. See the ﬁRisk Management - Asset/Liability 
Management - Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Riskﬂ section in this Report for more information. The degree to which these sensitivities offset each other is dependent upon the timing and magnitude of changes in interest 
rates, and the slope of the yield curve. During a transition to a 
higher or lower interest rate environment, a reduction or 
increase in interest-sensitive earnings from the mortgage 
banking business could occur quickly, while the benefit or 
detriment from balance sheet repricing could take more time to 
develop. For example, our lower rate scenarios (scenario 1 and 
scenario 2) in the following table initially measure a decline in 
long-term interest rates versus our most likely scenario. 
Although the performance in these rate scenarios contain initial 
benefit from increased mortgage banking activity, the result is 
lower earnings relative to the most likely scenario over time 
given pressure on net interest income. The higher rate scenarios 
(scenario 3 and scenario 4) measure the impact of varying 
degrees of rising short-term and long-term interest rates over 
the course of the forecast horizon relative to the most likely 
scenario, both resulting in positive earnings sensitivity. As of December 31, 2014, our most recent simulations estimate earnings at risk over the next 24 months under a range 
of both lower and higher interest rates. The results of the 
simulations are summarized in Table 44, indicating cumulative 
net income after tax earnings sensitivity relative to the most 
likely earnings plan over the 24 month horizon (a positive range 
indicates a beneficial earnings sensitivity measurement relative 
to the most likely earnings plan and a negative range indicates a 
detrimental earnings sensitivity relative to the most likely 
earnings plan). 86  Table 44: Earnings Sensitivity Over 24 Month Horizon

We use the investment securities portfolio and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposures. See the ﬁBalance Sheet 
Analysis - Investment Securitiesﬂ section in this Report for more 

maturity securities portfolios. The notional or contractual 
amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used 
to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of 
December€31,€2014, and December 31, 2013, are presented in 
Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
Ł to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios, including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and Ł to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options. MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK€We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects 
us to various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate 
risks. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce 
credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing some or all of 
the long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans we originate and most 
of the ARMs we originate. On the other hand, we may hold 
originated ARMs and fixed-rate mortgage loans in our loan 
portfolio as an investment for our growing base of core deposits. 
We determine whether the loans will be held for investment or 
held for sale at the time of commitment. We may subsequently 
change our intent to hold loans for investment and sell some or 
all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as part of our corporate 
asset/liability management. We may also acquire and add to our 
securities available for sale a portion of the securities issued at 
the time we securitize MHFS. As expected, with the increase in average mortgage interest rates in 2014, our mortgage banking revenue declined as the 
level of mortgage loan refinance activity decreased compared 
with 2013. The decline in mortgage loan origination income 
(primarily driven by the decline in mortgage loan refinancing 
volume) more than offset the increase in net servicing income. 
Despite the increase in average mortgage interest rates, the slow 
recovery in the housing sector, and the continued lack of 
liquidity in the nonconforming secondary markets, our mortgage 
banking revenue was strong in 2014, reflecting the 
complementary origination and servicing strengths of the business. The secondary market for agency-conforming mortgages functioned well during 2014. Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates may potentially 
reduce total origination and servicing fees, the value of our 
residential MSRs measured at fair value, the value of MHFS and 
the associated income and loss reflected in mortgage banking 
noninterest income, the income and expense associated with instruments (economic hedges) used to hedge changes in the fair 
value of MSRs and MHFS, and the value of derivative loan 
commitments (interest rate ﬁlocksﬂ) extended to mortgage 
applicants. Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination and servicing fees because consumer demand for new mortgages 
and the level of refinancing activity are sensitive to changes in 
mortgage interest rates. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest 
rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees 
and may also lead to an increase in servicing fee income, 
depending on the level of new loans added to the servicing 
portfolio and prepayments. Given the time it takes for consumer 
behavior to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the 
time required for processing a new application, providing the 
commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate 
changes will affect origination and servicing fees with a lag. The 
amount and timing of the impact on origination and servicing 
fees will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the 
change in interest rates. We measure originations of MHFS at fair value where an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist 
to reliably support fair value pricing models used for these loans. 
Loan origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, 
and related€direct loan origination costs are recognized when 
incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other 
interests held related to residential loan sales and 
securitizations. We believe fair value measurement for MHFS 
and other interests held, which we hedge with free-standing 
derivatives (economic hedges) along with our MSRs measured at 
fair value, reduces certain timing differences and better matches 
changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of 
derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. During 
2014 and 2013, in response to continued secondary market 
illiquidity, we continued to originate certain prime non-agency 
loans to be held for investment for the foreseeable future rather 
than to be held for sale. In addition, in 2013, we originated 
certain prime agency-eligible loans to be held for investment as 
part of our asset/liability management strategy. We initially measure all of our MSRs at fair value and carry substantially all of them at fair value depending on our strategy 
for managing interest rate risk. Under this method, the MSRs 
are recorded at fair value at the time we sell or securitize the 
related mortgage loans. The carrying value of MSRs carried at 
fair value reflects changes in fair value at the end of each quarter 
and changes are included in net servicing income, a component 
of mortgage banking noninterest income. If the fair value of the 
MSRs increases, income is recognized; if the fair value of the 
MSRs decreases, a loss is recognized. We use a dynamic and 
sophisticated model to estimate the fair value of our MSRs and 
periodically benchmark our estimates to independent appraisals. 
The valuation of MSRs can be highly subjective and involve 
complex judgments by management about matters that are 
inherently unpredictable. See ﬁCritical Accounting Policies -
Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rightsﬂ section in 
this Report for additional information. Changes in interest rates 
influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the 
periodic valuation of MSRs, including prepayment speeds, 
expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset 
portfolio, the value of escrow balances and other servicing 
valuation elements. A decline in interest rates generally increases the propensity for refinancing, reduces the expected duration of the servicing 
portfolio and therefore reduces the estimated fair value of MSRs. 
This reduction in fair value causes a charge to income for MSRs 
carried at fair value, net of any gains on free-standing derivatives 87 Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) (economic hedges) used to hedge MSRs. We may choose not to fully hedge all the potential decline in the value of our MSRs 
resulting from a decline in interest rates because the potential 
increase in origination/servicing fees in that scenario provides a 
partial ﬁnatural business hedge.ﬂ An increase in interest rates 
generally reduces the propensity for refinancing, extends the 
expected duration of the servicing portfolio and therefore 
increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an 
increase in interest rates can also reduce mortgage loan demand 
and therefore reduce origination income. The price risk associated with our MSRs is economically hedged with a combination of highly liquid interest rate forward 
instruments including mortgage forward contracts, interest rate 
swaps and interest rate options. All of the instruments included 
in the hedge are marked to market daily. Because the hedging 
instruments are traded in highly liquid markets, their prices are 
readily observable and are fully reflected in each quarter™s mark 
to market. Quarterly MSR hedging results include a combination 
of directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any 
carry income generated. If the economic hedge is effective, its 
overall directional hedge gain or loss will offset the change in the 
valuation of the underlying MSR asset. Gains or losses 
associated with these economic hedges are included in mortgage 
banking noninterest income. Consistent with our longstanding 
approach to hedging interest rate risk in the mortgage business, 
the size of the hedge and the particular combination of forward 
hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce 
the volatility of the mortgage business™s earnings over various 
time frames within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because 
market factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing 
portfolio and the relationship between the origination and 
servicing sides of our mortgage business change continually, the 
types of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and 
rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors 
and the interest rate risk inherent in our MSRs portfolio. 
Throughout 2014, our economic hedging strategy generally used 
forward mortgage purchase contracts that were effective at 
offsetting the impact of interest rates on the value of the MSR 
asset. Mortgage forward contracts are designed to pass the full economics of the underlying reference mortgage securities to the 
holder of the contract, including both the directional gain and 
loss from the forward delivery of the reference securities and the 
corresponding carry income. Carry income represents the 
contract™s price accretion from the forward delivery price to the 
spot price including both the yield earned on the reference 
securities and the market implied cost of financing during the 
period. The actual amount of carry income earned on the hedge 
each quarter will depend on the amount of the underlying asset 
that is hedged and the particular instruments included in the 
hedge. The level of carry income is driven by the slope of the 
yield curve and other market driven supply and demand factors 
affecting the specific reference securities. A steep yield curve 
generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted 
yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry 
income. The level of carry income is also affected by the type of 
instrument used. In general, mortgage forward contracts tend to 
produce higher carry income than interest rate swap contracts. 
Carry income is recognized over the life of the mortgage forward 
as a component of the contract™s mark to market gain or loss. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. While we attempt to balance 
these various aspects of the mortgage business, there are several 
potential risks to earnings: Ł Valuation changes for MSRs associated with interest rate 
changes are recorded in earnings immediately within the 
accounting period in which those interest rate changes 
occur, whereas the impact of those same changes in interest 
rates on origination and servicing fees occur with a lag and 
over time. Thus, the mortgage business could be protected 
from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time 
on a cumulative basis but still display large variations in 
income from one accounting period to the next. Ł The degree to which our net gains on loan originations 
offsets valuation changes for MSRs is imperfect, varies at 
different points in the interest rate cycle, and depends not 
just on the direction of interest rates but on the pattern of 
quarterly interest rate changes. Ł Origination volumes, the valuation of MSRs and hedging 
results and associated costs are also affected by many 
factors. Such factors include the mix of new business 
between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages, the relationship 
between short-term and long-term interest rates, the degree 
of volatility in interest rates, the relationship between 
mortgage interest rates and other interest rate markets, and 
other interest rate factors. Additional factors that can 
impact the valuation of the MSRs include changes in 
servicing and foreclosure costs due to changes in investor or 
regulatory guidelines, as well as individual state foreclosure 
legislation, and changes in discount rates due to market 
participants requiring a higher return due to updated 
market expectations on costs and risks associated with 
investing in MSRs. Many of these factors are hard to predict 
and we may not be able to directly or perfectly hedge their 
effect. Ł While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial 
instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the 
values and income being hedged. For example, the change 
in the value of ARM production held for sale from changes 
in mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by 
Treasury and LIBOR index-based financial instruments 
used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Additionally, 
hedge-carry income we earn on our economic hedges for the 
MSRs may not continue if the spread between short-term 
and long-term rates decreases, we shift composition of the 
hedge to more interest rate swaps, or there are other 
changes in the market for mortgage forwards that affect the 
implied carry. The total carrying value of our residential and commercial MSRs was $14.0 billion and $16.8 billion at December 31, 2014 
and 2013, respectively. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.45% and 4.52% at 

December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The carrying value of 
our total MSRs represented 0.75% and 0.88% of mortgage loans 

serviced for others at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As part of our mortgage banking activities, we enter into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified 
times in the future. A mortgage loan commitment is an interest 
rate lock that binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a 
specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, 
generally up to 60 days after inception of the rate lock. These 
loan commitments are derivative loan commitments if the loans 
that will result from the exercise of the commitments will be held 
for sale. These derivative loan commitments are recognized at 
fair value on the balance sheet with changes in their fair values 
recorded as part of mortgage banking noninterest income. The 
fair value of these commitments include, at inception and during 88 €€the life of the loan commitment, the expected net future cash 
flows related to the associated servicing of the loan as part of the 
fair value measurement of derivative loan commitments. 
Changes subsequent to inception are based on changes in fair 
value of the underlying loan resulting from the exercise of the 
commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will not 

out factor. The value of the underlying loan commitment is 
affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of 
time. Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose us to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the 
commitments might decline due to increases in mortgage 
interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the 
loan. To minimize this risk, we employ mortgage forwards and 
options, Eurodollar futures and options, and Treasury futures, 
forwards and options contracts as economic hedges against the 
potential decreases in the values of the loans. We expect that 
these derivative financial instruments will experience changes in 
fair value that will either fully or partially offset the changes in 
fair value of the derivative loan commitments. However, changes 
in investor demand, such as concerns about credit risk, can also 
cause changes in the spread relationships between underlying 
loan value and the derivative financial instruments that cannot 
be hedged. MARKET RISK - TRADING ACTIVITIES€The Finance Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the acceptable 
market risk appetite for our trading activities. We engage in 
trading activities primarily to accommodate the investment and 
risk management activities of our customers, execute economic 
hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks and, to a very 
limited degree, for proprietary trading for our own account. 
These activities primarily occur within our Wholesale Banking 
businesses and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. 
This includes entering into transactions with our customers that 
are recorded as trading assets and liabilities on our balance 
sheet. All of our trading assets and liabilities, including 
securities, foreign exchange transactions, commodity 
transactions, and derivatives are carried at fair value. Income 
earned related to these trading activities include net interest 
income and changes in fair value related to trading assets and 
liabilities. Net interest income earned on trading assets and 
liabilities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our income statement. Changes in fair value of 
trading assets and liabilities are reflected in net gains on trading 
activities, a component of noninterest income in our income 
statement. Table 45 presents total revenue from trading activities. Table 45:€Income from Trading Activities

(4) Excludes economic hedging of mortgage banking activities and asset/liability 

management. Customer accommodation Customer accommodation activities are conducted to help customers manage their investment and 
risk management needs. We engage in market-making activities 
or act as an intermediary to purchase or sell financial 
instruments in anticipation of or in response to customer needs. 
This category also includes positions we use to manage our 
exposure to customer transactions. For the majority of our customer accommodation trading, we serve as intermediary between buyer and seller. For example, 
we may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to 
manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into 
offsetting derivative or security positions with a separate 
counterparty or exchange to manage our exposure to the 
derivative with our customer. We earn income on this activity 
based on the transaction price difference between the customer 
and offsetting derivative or security positions, which is reflected 
in the fair value changes of the positions recorded in net gains on 
trading activities. Customer accommodation trading also includes net gains related to market-making activities in which we take positions to 
facilitate customer order flow. For example, we may own 
securities recorded as trading assets (long positions) or sold 
securities we have not yet purchased, recorded as trading 
liabilities (short positions), typically on a short-term basis, to 
facilitate support of buying and selling demand from our 
customers. As a market maker in these securities, we earn 
income due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or 
received for the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask 
spread), (2) the net interest income, and (3) the change in fair 
value of the long or short positions during the short-term period 
held on our balance sheet. Additionally, we may enter into 
separate derivative or security positions to manage our exposure 
related to our long or short security positions. Collectively, 
income earned on this type of market-making activity is reflected 
in the fair value changes of these positions recorded in net gain 
on trading activities. 89 Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) Economic hedges and other Economic hedges in trading are not designated in a hedge accounting relationship and exclude economic hedging related to our asset/liability risk management 
and substantially all mortgage banking risk management 
activities. Economic hedging activities include the use of trading 
securities to economically hedge risk exposures related to non-
trading activities or derivatives to hedge risk exposures related 
to trading assets or trading liabilities. Economic hedges are 
unrelated to our customer accommodation activities. Other 
activities include financial assets held for investment purposes 
that we elected to carry at fair value with changes in fair value 
recorded to earnings in order to mitigate accounting 
measurement mismatches or avoid embedded derivative 
accounting complexities. Proprietary trading Proprietary trading consists of security or derivative positions executed for our own account based upon market expectations or to benefit from price differences between 
financial instruments and markets. Proprietary trading activity 
has been substantially restricted by the Dodd-Frank Act Table 46:€Distribution of Daily Trading-Related Revenues 
provisions known as the ﬁVolcker Rule.ﬂ Accordingly, we 
reduced and are exiting certain business activities in anticipation 
of the rule™s compliance date. As discussed within this section 
and the noninterest income section of our financial results, 
proprietary trading activity is insignificant to our business and 
financial results. For more details on the Volcker Rule, see the 
ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ section in this Report. Daily Trading-Related Revenue Table 46 provides information on the distribution of daily trading-related revenues for the Company™s trading portfolio. This trading-related revenue is 
defined as the change in value of the trading assets and trading 
liabilities, trading-related net interest income, and trading-
related intra-day gains and losses. Net trading-related revenue does not include activity related to long-term positions held for 
economic hedging purposes, period-end adjustments, and other activity not representative of daily price changes driven by 
market factors. Market Risk is the risk of adverse changes in the fair value of the trading portfolios and financial instruments held by the 
Company due to changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and 
commodity prices. Market risk is intrinsic to the Company™s 
sales and trading, market making, investing, and risk 
management activities. The Company uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in 
measuring and monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are monitored at both the business unit level and at 
aggregated levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk 
management function aggregates and monitors all exposures to 
ensure risk measures are within our established risk appetite. 
Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on 
a daily basis. The Company monitors various market risk 
exposure measures from a variety of perspectives, which include 
line of business, product, risk type, and legal entity. 90    VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets. The VaR measures assume that historical changes in market values 
(historical simulation analysis) are representative of the 
potential future outcomes and measure the expected loss over a 
given time interval (for example, 1 day or 10 days) within a given 
confidence level. Our historical simulation analysis approach 
uses historical observations of daily changes of each of the 
market risk factors from each trading day in the previous 
12€months. The risk drivers of each market risk exposure are 
updated on a daily basis. We measure and report VaR for a 1-day 
holding period at a 99% confidence level. This means that we 
would expect to incur single day losses greater than predicted by 
VaR estimates for the measured positions one time in every 
100€trading days. We treat data from all historical periods as 
equally relevant and consider using data for the previous 12 
months as appropriate for determining VaR. We believe using a 
12-month look back period helps ensure the Company™s VaR is responsive to current market conditions. VaR measurement between different financial institutions is not readily comparable due to modeling and assumption 
differences from company to company. VaR measures are more 
useful when interpreted as an indication of trends rather than an 
absolute measure to be compared across financial institutions. VaR models are subject to limitations which include, but are not limited to, the use of historical changes in market factors 
that may not accurately reflect future changes in market factors, 
and the inability to predict market liquidity in extreme market 
conditions. All limitations such as model inputs, model 
assumptions, and calculation methodology risk are monitored by 
the Corporate Market Risk Group and the Corporate Model Risk 
Group. The VaR models measure exposure to the following categories: Table 47:€Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR Risk Category 
Ł credit risk - exposures from corporate credit spreads, asset-
backed security spreads, and mortgage prepayments. Ł interest rate risk - exposures from changes in the level, 
scope, and curvature of interest rate curves and the volatility 
of interest rates. Ł equity risk - exposures to changes in equity prices and 
volatilities of single name, index, and basket exposure. Ł commodity risk - exposures to changes in commodity prices 
and volatilities. Ł foreign exchange risk - exposures to changes in foreign 
exchange rates and volatilities. VaR is the primary market risk management measure for the assets and liabilities classified as trading and is used as a supplemental analysis tool to monitor exposures classified as 
available for sale (AFS) and other exposures that we carry at fair 
value. Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the market risk exhibited by the Company™s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions 
classified as trading assets or trading liabilities on our balance 
sheet. Table 47 shows the results of the Company™s Trading VaR by risk category. As presented in the table, average Trading VaR 
was $21 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, 
compared with $17 million for the quarter ended 

September€30,€2014. The increase was primarily driven by 
changes in portfolio composition. Quarter ended (in millions) Period€end€Average€December 31, 2014 Low€High€Period

risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days. 
Sensitivity Analysis Given the inherent limitations of the VaR Stress Testing While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the testing captures the Company™s exposure to extreme but low measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% probability market movements. Stress scenarios estimate the increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We risk of losses based on management™s assumptions of abnormal conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, but severe market movements such as severe credit spread volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. widening or a large decline in equity prices. These scenarios Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an assume that the market moves happen instantaneously and no indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market moves. events unfold (a conservative approach since experience 
demonstrates otherwise). 91 Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation and 
differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the impact 
of large movements in financial variables on portfolio values. 
Typical examples include a 100 basis point increase across the 
yield curve or a 10% decline in stock market indexes. Historical 
scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress scenarios 
are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors relevant 
to a portfolio. The Company™s stress testing framework is also used in calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board™s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis & Review (CCAR) and internal 
stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section in 
this Report. Regulatory Market Risk Capital is based on U.S. regulatory agency risk-based capital regulations that are based on the Basel Committee Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision. Prior to January 1, 2013, U.S. banking regulators™ 
market risk capital requirements were subject to Basel I and 
thereafter based on Basel 2.5. Effective January 1, 2014, the 
Company must calculate regulatory capital based on the Basel III 
market risk capital rule, which integrated Basel 2.5, and requires 
banking organizations with significant trading activities to adjust 
their capital requirements to better account for the market risks 
of those activities based on a comprehensive and risk sensitive 
method and models. The market risk capital rule is intended to Table 48:€Market Risk Regulatory Capital€and RWAs 
cover the risk of loss in value of covered positions due to changes 
in market conditions. Composition of Material Portfolio of Covered Positions The market risk capital rule substantially modified the determination of market risk risk-weighted assets (RWAs), and implemented a 
more risk-sensitive methodology for the risks inherent in certain 
ﬁcoveredﬂ trading positions. The positions that are ﬁcoveredﬂ by 
the market risk capital rule are generally a subset of our trading 
assets and trading liabilities, specifically those held by the 
Company for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent 
of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price 
movements, or to lock in arbitrage profits. Positions excluded 
from market risk regulatory capital treatment are subject to the 
credit risk capital rules applicable to the ﬁnon-coveredﬂ trading 
positions. The material portfolio of the Company™s ﬁcoveredﬂ positions is predominantly concentrated in the trading assets and trading 
liabilities managed within Wholesale Banking where the 
substantial portion of market risk capital is required. Wholesale 
Banking engages in the fixed income, traded credit, foreign 
exchange, equities, and commodities markets businesses. Other 
business segments hold small additional trading positions 
covered under the market risk capital rule. Table 48 summarizes the market risk-based capital requirements charge and market RWAs in accordance with the 
Basel III market risk capital rule as of December 31, 2014, and in 
accordance with the Basel 2.5 market risk capital rule as of 
December 31, 2013. The market RWAs are calculated as the sum 
of the components in the table below. December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (in millions) Total VaR $ Risk-based capital 146 Risk-weighted assets 1,822 Risk-

49,613 The increase in standardized specific risk charge for risk-based capital and RWAs in 2014 resulted primarily from a change during the quarter ended March 31, 2014, in positions 
now subject to standardized specific risk charges. All changes to 
market risk regulatory capital and RWAs in the quarter ended Table 50:€Regulatory 10-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 
December 31, 2014, were associated with changes in positions 
due to normal trading activity. 
Regulatory Market Risk Capital Components The capital required for market risk on the Company™s ﬁcoveredﬂ positions is 
determined by internally developed models or standardized 
specific risk charges. The market risk regulatory capital models 
are subject to internal model risk management and validation. 
The models are continuously monitored and enhanced in 
response to changes in market conditions, improvements in 
system capabilities, and changes in the Company™s market risk 
exposure. The Company is required to obtain and has received 
prior written approval from its regulators before using its 
internally developed models to calculate the market risk capital 
charge. Basel III prescribes various VaR measures in the determination of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. 
The Company uses the same VaR models for both market risk 
management purposes as well as regulatory capital calculations. 
For regulatory purposes, we use the following metrics to 
determine the Company™s market risk capital requirements: General VaR measures the risk of broad market movements such 
as changes in the level of credit spreads, interest rates, equity 
prices, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. General 
VaR uses historical simulation analysis based on 99% confidence 
level and a 10-day time horizon. Table 50 shows the General VaR measure categorized by major risk categories. Average 10-day General VaR was 
$36€million for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, compared 
with $29 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2014
. The increase was primarily driven by changes in portfolio 
composition. Quarter ended€December 31, 2014 September 30, 2014 Period Period

risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days. 
Specific Risk measures the risk of loss that could result from

Total 
Stressed VaR uses the same methodology and models as Total Total VaR (as presented in Table 51) is composed of General VaR VaR. and Specific Risk and uses the previous 12 months of historical 
market data to comply with regulatory requirements. 93  €    Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) Incremental Risk Charge according to the market risk capital rule, must capture losses due to both issuer default and 
migration risk at the 99.9% confidence level over the one-year 
capital horizon under the assumption of constant level of risk or 

securitized credit-sensitive products. The Company calculates Incremental Risk by generating a portfolio loss distribution using Monte Carlo simulation, which 
assumes numerous scenarios, where an assumption is made that 
the portfolio™s composition remains constant for a one-year time 
horizon. Individual issuer credit grade migration and issuer 
default risk is modeled through generation of the issuer™s credit 
rating transition based upon statistical modeling. Correlation 
between credit grade migration and default is captured by a Table 51:€Market Risk Regulatory Capital Modeled Components 
multifactor proprietary model which takes into account industry 
classifications as well as regional effects. Additionally, the 
impact of market and issuer specific concentrations is reflected 
in the modeling framework by assignment of a higher charge for 
portfolios that have increasing concentrations in particular 
issuers or sectors. Lastly, the model captures product basis risk; 
that is, it reflects the material disparity between a position and 
its hedge. Table 51 provides information on the Incremental Risk Charge results for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. For this 
charge, the required capital at quarter end equals the average for

Securitized Products Charge Basel III requires a separate market risk capital charge for positions classified as a 
securitization or re-securitization. The primary criteria for 
classification as a securitization are whether there is a transfer of 
risk and whether the credit risk associated with the underlying 
exposures has been separated into at least two tranches 
reflecting different levels of seniority. Covered trading 
securitizations positions include consumer and commercial 
asset-backed securities (ABS), commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities 
(RMBS), and collateralized loan and other debt obligations 
(CLO/CDO) positions. The securitization capital requirements 
are the greater of the capital requirements of the net long or 
short exposure, and are capped at the maximum loss that could 
be incurred on any given transaction. Table 52 shows the 
aggregate net fair market value of securities and derivative 
securitization positions by exposure type that meet the 
regulatory definition of a covered trading securitization position 
at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Table 52:€Covered Securitization Positions by Exposure Type

489 SECURITIZATION DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK MONITORING The market risk capital rule requires that the Company conduct due diligence on the risk of each position within three days of the 
purchase of a securitization position. The Company's due 
diligence on the creditworthiness of each position provides an 
understanding of the features that would materially affect the 
performance of a securitization or re-securitization. The due 
diligence analysis is performed again on a quarterly basis for 
each securitization and re-securitization position. The Company 
uses an automated solution to track the due diligence associated 
with securitization activity. The Company aims to manage the 
risks associated with securitization and re-securitization 
positions through the use of offsetting positions and portfolio 
diversification. Standardized Specific Risk Charge For debt and equity positions that are not evaluated by the approved internal specific risk 
models, a regulatory prescribed standard specific risk charge is 
applied. The standard specific risk add-on for sovereign entities, 
public sector entities, and depository institutions is based on the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) country risk classifications (CRC) and the remaining 
contractual maturity of the position. These risk add-ons for debt 
positions range from 0.25% to 12%. The add-on for corporate 
debt is based on creditworthiness and the remaining contractual 
maturity of the position. All other types of debt positions are 
subject to an 8% add-on. The standard specific risk add-on for 
equity positions is generally 8%. Comprehensive Risk Charge / Correlation Trading The market risk capital rule requires capital for correlation trading positions. The Company's remaining correlation trading exposure covered 
under the market risk capital rule matured in fourth quarter 
2014. VaR Backtesting The market risk capital rule requires backtesting as one form of validation of the VaR model. Backtesting is a comparison of the daily VaR estimate with the 
actual clean profit and loss (clean P&L) as defined by the market 94 risk capital rule. Clean P&L is the change in the value of the Company™s covered trading positions that would have occurred 
had previous end-of-day covered trading positions remained 
unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, net interest 
income, and intraday trading gains and losses). The backtesting 
analysis compares the daily Total VaR for each of the trading 
days in the preceding 12 months with the net clean P&L. Clean 
P&L does not include credit adjustments and other activity not 
representative of daily price changes driven by market risk 
factors. The clean P&L measure of revenue is used to evaluate 
the performance of the Total VaR and is not comparable to our 
actual daily trading net revenues, as reported elsewhere in this 
Report. Any observed clean P&L loss in excess of the Total VaR is considered a market risk regulatory capital backtesting 
exception. The actual number of exceptions (that is, the number Table 53:€Daily Total 1-Day 99% VaR Measure (Rolling 12 Months) 
of business days for which the clean P&L losses exceed the 
corresponding 1-day, 99% Total VaR measure) over the 
preceding 12 months is used to determine the capital multiplier 
for the capital calculation. The number of actual backtesting 
exceptions is dependent on current market performance relative 
to historic market volatility. This capital multiplier increases 
from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on 
the number of exceptions. No backtesting exceptions occurred 
over the preceding 12 months. Backtesting is also performed at 
granular levels within the Company with sub-portfolio results 
provided to federal regulators. Table 53 shows daily Total VaR (1-day, 99%) for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. The Company™s average Total 
VaR for fourth quarter 2014 was $22 million with a low of $17 
million and a high of $28 million. Market Risk Governance The Finance Committee of our Board has primary oversight over market risk-taking activities of the 
Company and reviews the acceptable market risk appetite. The 
Corporate Risk Group™s Market Risk Committee, which reports 
to the Finance Committee of the Board, is responsible for 
governance and oversight over market risk-taking activities 
across the Company as well as the establishment of market risk 
appetite and associated limits. The Corporate Market Risk 
Group, which is part of the Corporate Risk Group, administers 
and monitors compliance with the requirements established by 
the Market Risk Committee. The Corporate Market Risk Group 
has oversight responsibilities in identifying, measuring and 
monitoring the Company™s market risk. The group is responsible 
for developing corporate market risk policy, creating 
quantitative market risk models, establishing independent risk 
limits, calculating and analyzing market risk capital, and 
reporting aggregated and line-of-business market risk information. Limits are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain 
relevant and within the market risk appetite for the Company. 
An automated limits-monitoring system enables a daily comprehensive review of multiple limits mandated across 
businesses. Limits are set with inner boundaries that will be 
periodically breached to promote an ongoing dialogue of risk 
exposure within the Company. Each line of business that exposes 
the Company to market risk has direct responsibility for 
managing market risk in accordance with defined risk tolerances 
and approved market risk mandates and hedging strategies. We 
measure and monitor market risk for both management and 
regulatory capital purposes. Model Risk Management The market risk capital models are governed by our Corporate Model Risk Committee (CMoR) policies and procedures, which include model validation. The 
purpose of model validation includes ensuring the model is 
appropriate for its intended use and that appropriate controls 
exist to help mitigate the risk of invalid results. Model validation 
assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of the model, 
including reviewing its key components such as inputs, 
processing components, logic or theory, output results and 
supporting model documentation. Validation also includes 95 Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate given observable market transactions or other market data 
within the same or similar asset classes. This ensures modeled 
approaches are appropriate given similar product valuation 
techniques and are in line with their intended purpose. The 
Corporate Model Risk Group provides oversight of model 
validation and assessment processes. All internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by business-unit-level management, and all models are subject 
to additional oversight by a corporate-level risk management 
department. Corporate oversight responsibilities include 
evaluating the adequacy of business unit risk management 
programs, maintaining company-wide model validation policies 
and standards, and reporting the results of these activities to 
management. MARKET RISK - EQUITY INVESTMENTS We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make 
and manage direct equity investments in start-up businesses, 
emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, 
acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in 
non-affiliated funds that make similar private equity 
investments. These private equity investments are made within 
capital allocations approved by management and the Board. The 
Board™s policy is to review business developments, key risks and 
historical returns for the private equity investment portfolio at 
least annually. Management reviews these investments at least 
quarterly and assesses them for possible OTTI. For 
nonmarketable investments, the analysis is based on facts and 
circumstances of each individual investment and the 
expectations for that investment™s cash flows and capital needs, 
the viability of its business model and our exit strategy. 
Nonmarketable investments include private equity investments 
accounted for under the cost method, equity method and fair 
value option. As part of our business to support our customers, we trade public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds.€We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities in the available-for-sale 
securities portfolio, including securities relating to our venture 
capital activities. We manage these investments within capital 
risk limits approved by management and the Board and 
monitored by Corporate ALCO. Gains and losses on these 
securities are recognized in net income when realized and 
periodically include OTTI charges. Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net income by (1) the value of third party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose 
ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the 
stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission 
income and other business activities. Each business line 
monitors and manages these indirect risks. Table 54 provides information regarding our marketable and nonmarketable equity investments as of December 31, 2014 
and 2013. Table 54:€Nonmarketable and Marketable Equity

96 LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING€The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board of Directors 
establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-
based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to 
avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. 
These guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the 
Corporate ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board of 
Directors. These guidelines are established and monitored for 

alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for 
its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid securities. These assets 
make up our primary sources of liquidity which are presented in Table 55:€Primary Sources of Liquidity 
Table 55. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Securities included as part of our primary sources of 
liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, 
and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies 
within our investment securities portfolio. We believe these 
securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Some of these securities are within the held-to-maturity portion 
of our investment securities portfolio and as such are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. Some 
of the legal entities within our consolidated group of companies 
are subject to various regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions 
that can limit the transferability of their funds.€We believe we 
maintain adequate liquidity at these entities in consideration of 
such funds transfer restrictions.

97 € €Risk Management - Asset/Liability Management (continued) We access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and 
asset-backed secured funding. Investors in the long-term capital 
markets, as well as other market participants, generally will 
consider, among other factors, a company™s debt rating in 
making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings 
on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and 
quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. In light of industry changes and regulatory developments related to the Title II Orderly Liquidation Authority of the Dodd-
Frank Act, rating agencies have proposed changes to various 
aspects of their ratings methodologies. Moody™s Investors 
Service has proposed significant revisions to its rating 
methodology, with a focus on how each type of creditor would be 
affected in any bank failure. Standard and Poor™s Ratings 
Services (S&P) is continuing its reassessment of whether to Table 57: Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2014 
incorporate the likelihood of extraordinary government support 
into the ratings of certain bank holding companies, including the 
Parent. In addition, S&P has recently issued a proposal to 
incorporate into its bank-level rating methodology an 
assessment of additional capital available to absorb losses to 
reduce default risk. During fourth quarter 2014, our ratings were 
affirmed by Fitch Ratings and formally reviewed by S&P, with no 
changes. Both the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. remain 
among the top-rated financial firms in the U.S. See the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Managementﬂ and ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ sections in this Report for additional 
information regarding our credit ratings as of 
December€31,€2014, and the potential impact a credit rating 
downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations, as well

consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule 
requires banking institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold 
high-quality liquid assets, such as central bank reserves and 
government and corporate debt that can be converted easily 
and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its 
projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. The 
final LCR rule will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2015, 
and requires full compliance with a minimum 100% LCR by 
January€1, 2017. The FRB also recently finalized rules imposing 
enhanced liquidity management standards on large bank 
holding companies (BHC) such as Wells Fargo. We will continue 
to analyze these recently finalized rules and other regulatory 
proposals that may affect liquidity risk management to 
determine the level of operational or compliance impact to 
Wells€Fargo. For additional information see the ﬁCapital

statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. In 
May 2014, the Parent€filed€a registration statement€with the SEC 
for the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, preferred 
stock and other securities. The Parent™s ability to issue debt and 
other securities under this€registration statement€is limited by 
the debt issuance authority granted by the Board. The Parent is 
currently authorized by the Board to issue $60 billion in 

outstanding short-term debt and $170 billion in outstanding 
long-term debt. At December€31, 2014, the Parent had available 

$42.3 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and 

$67.8€billion in long-term debt issuance authority.€The Parent™s 
debt issuance authority granted by the Board includes short-
term and long-term debt issued to affiliates. During 2014, the 
Parent issued $18.1 billion of senior notes, of which $11.5 billion 

were registered with the SEC. In addition, during 2014, the 
Parent issued $4.5 billion of subordinated notes, all of which 

were registered with the SEC. Additionally, in February 2015, the 
Parent issued $5.2 billion of registered senior notes. 
The Parent™s proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in 
the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect 
the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for 
the same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender 
offer, or otherwise. Table 58 provides information regarding the Parent™s medium-term note (MTN) programs. The Parent may issue 
senior and subordinated debt securities under Series L & M, 
Series N & O, and the European and Australian programmes. 
Under Series K, the Parent may issue senior debt securities 
linked to one or more indices or bearing interest at a fixed or 
floating rate. 98  €Table 58: Medium-Term Note (MTN) Programs

by its board of directors to issue $100 billion€in outstanding 

short-term debt and $125 billion in outstanding long-term debt. 

At December€31, 2014, Wells€Fargo Bank, N.A. had available 

$100 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and 
$63.5€billion in long-term debt issuance authority. In March 

2012, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. established a $100 billion bank 

note program under which, subject to any other debt 
outstanding under the limits described above, it may issue $50€billion in outstanding short-term senior notes and $50€billion in outstanding long-term senior or subordinated 
notes. During 2014, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. issued $3.1 billion of 

senior notes under the bank note program. At 
December€31,€2014, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had remaining 
issuance capacity under the bank note program of $50 billion in 

short-term senior notes and $33.5 billion in long-term senior or 

subordinated notes. In addition, during 2014, Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A. executed advances of $15.0 billion with the Federal Home 

Loan Bank of Des Moines, and as of December 31, 2014, 
Wells€Fargo Bank N.A. had outstanding advances of $34.1 billion

across the Federal Home Loan Bank System.Wells€Fargo Canada Corporation In February 2014, Wells€Fargo Canada Corporation (WFCC), an indirect wholly 
owned Canadian subsidiary of the Parent, qualified with the 
Canadian provincial securities commissions a base shelf 
prospectus for the distribution from time to time in Canada of up 
to CAD $7.0 billion in medium-term notes. At 

December€31,€2014, CAD $7.0 billion still remained available for 

future issuance under this prospectus. During 2014, WFCC 
issued CAD $1.3 billion in medium-term notes under a prior 

base shelf prospectus. All medium-term notes issued by WFCC 
are unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP The Federal Home Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that 
lending institutions use to finance housing and economic 
development in local communities. We are a member of the 
FHLBs based in Dallas, Des Moines and San€Francisco. Each 
member of the FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum 
investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB. The board of 
directors of each FHLB can increase the minimum investment 
requirements in the event it has concluded that additional 
capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital 
requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment 
requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of 
the Federal Housing Finance Board. Because the extent of any 
obligation to increase our investment in any of the FHLBs 
depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential 
future payments to the FHLBs are not determinable. 99 Capital Management We have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the Company™s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
Our potential sources of capital primarily include retention of 
earnings net of dividends, as well as issuances of common and 
preferred stock. Retained earnings increased $14.7 billion from 

December€31, 2013, predominantly from Wells€Fargo net income 

of $23.1 billion, less common and preferred stock dividends of 

$8.4€billion. During 2014, we issued 96.3 million shares of 

common stock. In April 2014, we issued 2 million Depositary 
Shares, each representing 1/25th interest in a share of the 
Company™s newly issued 5.9% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series S, for an 
aggregate public offering price of $2.0 billion. In July 2014, we 
issued 32 million Depositary Shares, each representing 1/1000th 
interest in a share of the Company™s newly issued Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series T, for an 
aggregate public offering price of $800 million. In addition, in 
January 2015, we issued 2 million Depositary Shares, each 
representing 1/25th interest in a share of the Company™s newly 
issued 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual 
Class A Preferred Stock, Series U, for an aggregate public 
offering price of $2.0 billion. During 2014, we repurchased 
183.1€million shares of common stock in open market 

transactions, private transactions and from employee benefit 
plans, at a cost of $9.2€billion. We also entered into a $750 

million forward repurchase contract with an unrelated third 
party in October€2014 that settled in January 2015 for 14.3 
million shares. In addition, we entered into another $750 million 
forward repurchase contract with an unrelated third party in 
January 2015 that is expected to settle in second quarter 2015 
for approximately 14.3 million shares. For additional 
information about our forward repurchase agreements, see 
Note€1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. Regulatory Capital Guidelines The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are 
subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) 
guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to 
different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At 
December€31, 2014, the Company and each of our insured 

depository institutions were ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. See Note 26 (Regulatory 
and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for additional information. The RBC guidelines, which have their roots in the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS) establishing international guidelines for determining 
regulatory capital, reflect broad credit risk considerations and 
market-related risks, but do not take into account other types of 
risk facing a financial services company. Our capital adequacy assessment process contemplates a wide range of risks that the Company is exposed to and also takes into consideration our 
performance under a variety of stressed economic conditions, as 
well as regulatory expectations and guidance, rating agency 
viewpoints and the view of capital markets participants. The market risk capital rule, effective January 1, 2013, is reflected in the Company™s calculation of RWAs to address the market risks of significant trading activities. In December 2013, 
the FRB approved a final rule, effective April 1, 2014, revising the 
market risk capital rule to, among other things, conform to the 
FRB™s new capital framework finalized in July 2013 and 
discussed below. For additional information see the ﬁRisk 
Management - Asset/Liability Managementﬂ section in this 
Report. In 2007, federal banking regulators approved a final rule adopting revised international guidelines for determining 
regulatory capital known as ﬁBasel II.ﬂ Basel II incorporates 
three pillars that address (a) capital adequacy, (b) supervisory 
review, which relates to the computation of capital and internal 
assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through 
increased disclosure requirements. We entered the ﬁparallel run 
phaseﬂ of Basel II in July 2012. During the ﬁparallel run phase,ﬂ 
banking organizations must successfully complete an evaluation 
period under supervision from regulatory agencies in order to 
receive approval to calculate risk-based capital requirements 
under the Advanced Approach guidelines. The parallel run phase 
will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel 
reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our 
Advanced Approach regulatory capital results and related 
disclosures. In December 2010, the BCBS finalized a set of further revised international guidelines for determining regulatory 
capital known as ﬁBasel III.ﬂ These guidelines were developed in 
response to the 2008 financial crisis and were intended to 
address many of the weaknesses identified in the previous Basel 
standards, as well as in the banking sector that contributed to 
the crisis including excessive leverage, inadequate and low 
quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers. In July 2013, federal banking regulators approved final and interim final rules to implement the BCBS Basel III capital 
guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. These final capital 
rules, among other things: 
Ł implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory 
capital reforms including those that revise the definition of 
capital, increase minimum capital ratios, and introduce a 
minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5% and a 
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (for a total minimum 
CET1 ratio of 7.0%) and a potential countercyclical buffer of 
up to 2.5%, which would be imposed by regulators at their 
discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive credit 
growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk; Ł require a Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets 
ratio of 4% and introduce, for large and internationally 
active bank holding companies (BHCs), a Tier 1 
supplementary leverage ratio of 3% that incorporates off-
balance sheet exposures; Ł revise Basel I rules for calculating RWA to enhance risk 
sensitivity under a standardized approach; Ł modify the existing Basel II advanced approaches rules for 
calculating RWA to implement Basel III; Ł deduct certain assets from CET1, such as deferred tax assets 
that could not be realized through net operating loss carry-
backs, significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities, and MSRs, to the extent any one category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% 
of CET1; Ł eliminate the accumulated other comprehensive income or 
loss filter that applies under RBC rules over a five-year 
phase-in period beginning in 2014; and 100 Ł comply with the Dodd-Frank Act provision prohibiting the reliance on external credit ratings. We were required to comply with the final Basel III capital rules beginning January 2014, with certain provisions subject to phase-in periods. The Basel III capital rules are scheduled to be 
fully phased in by January 1, 2022. Based on the final capital 
rules, we estimate that our CET1 ratio under the final Basel III 
capital rules using the Advanced Approach (fully phased-in) 
exceeded the minimum of 7.0% by 343 basis points at 

December€31, 2014. 
Consistent with the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, banking organizations that have completed their parallel 
run process and have been approved by the FRB to use the 
Advanced Approach methodology to determine applicable 
minimum risk-weighted capital ratios and additional buffers, 
must use the higher of their RWA as calculated under (i) the 
Advanced Approach rules, and (ii) from January 1, 2014, to 
December€31, 2014, the general approach under Basel III capital 
rules and, commencing on January 1, 2015, and thereafter, the 
risk weightings under the standardized approach. In April 2014, federal banking regulators finalized a rule that enhances the supplementary leverage ratio requirements for 
large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured depository 
institutions. The rule, which becomes effective on January 1, 
2018, will require a covered BHC to maintain a supplementary 
leverage ratio of at least 5% to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rule will 
also require that all of our insured depository institutions 
maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% in order to be 
considered well capitalized. Based on our review, our current 
leverage levels would exceed the applicable requirements for the 
holding company and each of our insured depository 
institutions. Federal banking regulators, however, recently 
finalized additional changes to the supplementary leverage ratio 
requirements to implement revisions to the Basel III leverage 
framework finalized by the BCBS in January 2014. These 
additional changes, among other things, modify the 
methodology for including off-balance sheet items, including 
credit derivatives, repo-style transactions and lines of credit, in 
the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio, and will 
become effective on January 1, 2018. In addition, as discussed in 
the ﬁRisk Management - Asset/Liability Management - Liquidity 
and Fundingﬂ section in this Report, a final rule regarding the 
U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR was issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC in September 2014. The FRB has also indicated that it is in the process of considering new rules to address the amount of equity and 
unsecured debt a company must hold to facilitate its orderly 
liquidation, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC). In November 2014, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 
issued for public consultation policy proposals on TLAC. Under 
the FSB™s TLAC proposal, global systemically important banks 
(G-SIBs) would be required to hold loss absorbing equity and 
unsecured debt of 16-20% of RWAs, with at least 33% of this 
total being unsecured debt rather than equity. The FRB will 
likely propose related rules sometime after the FSB™s public 
consultation on the TLAC proposal ends. In addition, in December 2014, the FRB proposed rules to implement an additional CET1 capital surcharge on those U.S. 
banking organizations, such as the Company, that have been 
designated by the FSB as G-SIBs. The G-SIB surcharge would be 
in addition to the minimum Basel III 7.0% CET1 requirement. 
Under the FRB proposal, a G-SIB would calculate its surcharge 
under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method would consider the G-SIB™s size, 
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, 
and complexity, consistent with a methodology developed by the 
BCBS and FSB. The second would use similar inputs, but would 
replace substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding 
and would generally result in higher surcharges than the BCBS 
methodology. Under the FRB proposal, estimated surcharges for 
G-SIBs would range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of a firm™s RWAs. 
The G-SIB surcharge would be phased in beginning on 
January€1, 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019. 
The FSB, in an updated listing published in November 2014 
based on year-end 2013 data, identified the Company as one of 
the 30 G-SIBs. Capital Planning and Stress Testing Under the FRB™s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 
submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC™s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses the overall financial 
condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs while 
considering both quantitative and qualitative factors when 
evaluating capital plans. On March 26, 2014, the FRB notified us that it did not object to our 2014 capital plan included in the 2014 CCAR. Since 
the FRB notification, the Company took several capital actions 
during 2014, including increasing its quarterly common stock 
dividend rate to $0.35 per share and repurchasing shares of our 
common stock. Our 2015 CCAR, which was submitted on January 2, 2015, included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an 
assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given 
planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, 
similar to the process the FRB used to conduct the CCAR in 
2014. As part of the 2015 CCAR, the FRB also generated a 
supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp decline in the 
economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the 
information provided by the Company to estimate performance. 
The FRB is expected to review the supervisory stress results both 
as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of 
capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking into account the 
Company™s proposed capital actions. The FRB has indicated that 
it will publish its supervisory stress test results as required under 
the Dodd-Frank Act, and the related CCAR results taking into 
account the Company™s proposed capital actions, in March€2015. In addition to CCAR, federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient 
capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse 
economic and financial conditions. These stress testing 
requirements set forth the timing and type of stress test activities 
large BHCs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing 
stress testing controls, oversight and disclosure requirements. 
The FRB recently finalized rules amending the existing capital 
plan and stress testing rules to modify the start date of capital 
plan and stress testing cycles and to limit a large BHC™s ability to 
make capital distributions to the extent its actual capital 
issuances were less than amounts indicated in its capital plan. As 
required under the FRB™s stress testing rule, we completed a 
mid-cycle stress test based on March 31, 2014, data and 
scenarios developed by the Company. We submitted the results 
of the mid-cycle stress test to the FRB in July 2014 and disclosed 
a summary of the results in September 2014. 101 Capital Management (continued) Securities Repurchases From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do 
not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. 
Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market 
repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed 
block transactions, forward transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount and 
timing of our share repurchases, including our capital 
requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for 
employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions 
(including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and 
legal considerations, including the FRB™s response to our capital 
plan and to changes in our risk profile. In October 2012, the Board authorized the repurchase of 200€million shares, which was completed by July 2014. The 
Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 350 million 
shares in March 2014. At December€31, 2014, we had remaining 

authority to repurchase approximately 240 million shares, 
subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For more information 
about share repurchases during fourth quarter 2014, see Part II, 
Item 5 in our 2014 Form 10-K. Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under the ﬁsafe harborﬂ conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule€10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or 
all of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, 
including the standing daily volume limitation that applies 
whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. In connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program 
(TARP), we issued to the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to 
purchase 110,261,688 shares of our common stock with an 
original exercise price of $34.01 per share expiring on October 
28, 2018. The terms of the warrants require the exercise price to 
be adjusted under certain circumstances when the Company™s 
quarterly common stock dividend exceeds $0.34 per share, 
which began occurring in second quarter 2014. Accordingly, with 
each quarterly common stock dividend above $0.34 per share, 
we must calculate whether an adjustment to the exercise price is 
required by the terms of the warrants, including whether certain 
minimum thresholds have been met to trigger an adjustment, 
and notify the holders of any such change. The Board authorized 
the repurchase by the Company of up to $1 billion of the 
warrants. At December€31, 2014, there were 

38,424,434€warrants outstanding, exercisable at $33.996 per 
share, and $452 million of unused warrant repurchase authority. 
Depending on market conditions, we may purchase from time to 
time additional warrants in privately negotiated or open market 
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Risk-Based Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets Table 59 and Table 60 provide information regarding the

(5) Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to 

one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category 

is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total 
RWAs.

corresponding reconciliation to total equity, because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants. 
(2) The Basel III CET1 and RWAs are estimated based on the Basel III capital rules adopted July 2, 2013, by the FRB. The rules establish a new comprehensive capital 

framework for U.S. banking organizations that implement the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are being fully phased in 

effective January 1, 2014, through the end of 2021.

(4) The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach intended to replace Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain 

institutions. Under the final rules, we will be subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the 

assessment of our capital adequacy. While the amount of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches has been converging, the amount of RWAs 

as of December€31, 2014, was based on the Advanced Approach, which was higher than RWAs under the Standardized Approach, and thus resulted in a lower CET1 ratio 

compared with the Standardized Approach. Basel III capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board incorporate different classification of assets, with risk weights 

based on Wells Fargo's internal models, along with adjustments to address a combination of credit/counterparty, operational and market risks, and other Basel III 

elements. 137.1 2.4 105   Regulatory Reform Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. practices within covered banks and create certain risk financial services industry has been subject to a significant oversight responsibilities for their boards of directors. increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives.

The OCC, under separate authority, has also June 30, 2014. Wells Fargo has begun submitting such recently finalized guidelines establishing heightened metrics to the Volcker supervisory regulators. During the governance and risk management standards for large conformance period, banking entities are expected to national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC engage in good-faith planning efforts, appropriate for their guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to activities and investments, to enable them to conform all of a written risk governance framework in order to manage their activities and investments to the Volcker Rule™s and control their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also restrictions by no later than July 21, 2015. Limited further formalize roles and responsibilities for risk management extensions of the compliance period may be granted at the 
discretion of the FRB. The FRB has extended the rule™s 106 compliance date to give banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform their ownership interests in and sponsorships of 
covered funds that were in place prior to 
December€31,€2013, and the FRB has announced that it 
intends to provide an additional one-year extension to this 
date in the future. As a banking entity with more than 
$50€billion in consolidated assets, we will also be subject to 
enhanced compliance program requirements. At this time, 
we do not anticipate a material impact to our financial 
results from the rule as prohibited proprietary trading and 
covered fund investment activities are not significant to our 
financial results. Moreover, we already have reduced or 
exited certain businesses in anticipation of the rule™s 
compliance date and expect to have to make limited 
divestments in non-conforming funds as a result of the rule. Ł Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives and authorized the 
CFTC and the SEC to regulate swaps and security-based 
swaps, respectively. The CFTC and SEC jointly adopted new 
rules and interpretations that established the compliance 
dates for many of their rules implementing the new 
regulatory framework, including provisional registration of 
our national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as a 
swap dealer, which occurred at the end of 2012. In addition, 
the CFTC has adopted final rules that, among other things, 
require extensive regulatory and public reporting of swaps, 
require certain swaps to be centrally cleared and traded on 
exchanges or other multilateral platforms, and require swap 
dealers to comply with comprehensive internal and external 
business conduct standards. Also included in this regulatory 
framework are so-called push-out provisions affecting U.S. 
banks acting as dealers in commodity swaps, equity swaps 
and certain credit default swaps, which require that these 
activities be conducted through an affiliate. These push-out 
provisions have since been amended to apply only to 
structured finance swaps. Margin rules for swaps not 
centrally cleared have been proposed, and in September 
2014 were re-proposed. If adopted as re-proposed, the 
margin and capital requirements for swaps not centrally 
cleared may significantly increase the cost of hedging in the 
over-the-counter market. All of these new rules, as well as 
others being considered by regulators in other jurisdictions, 

counter derivatives and may increase our costs for engaging 
in swaps and other derivatives activities. Ł Changes to asset-backed securities (ABS) markets. The Dodd-Frank Act requires sponsors of ABS to hold at least a 
5% ownership stake in the ABS. Exemptions from the 
requirement include qualified residential mortgages 
(QRMs) and FHA/VA loans. In October 2014, federal 
regulatory agencies issued final rules to implement this 
credit risk retention requirement, which included an 
exemption for the GSE™s mortgage-backed securities. The 
final rules also aligned the definition of QRMs, which are 
exempt from the risk retention requirements, with the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau™s definition of 
ﬁqualified mortgage.ﬂ In addition, the final rules addressed 
the measures for complying with the risk retention 
requirement and continued to provide limited exemptions 
for qualifying commercial loans, qualifying commercial real 
estate loans, and qualifying automobile loans that meet 
certain requirements. We continue to evaluate the final 
rules and assess their impact on our ability to issue certain asset-backed securities or otherwise participate in various 
securitization transactions. Ł Enhanced regulation of money market mutual funds. On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted a rule governing money 
market mutual funds that, among other things, requires 
significant structural changes to these funds, including 
requiring institutional prime money market funds to 
maintain a variable net asset value and providing for the 
imposition of liquidity fees and redemption gates for all 
non-governmental money market funds during periods in 
which they experience liquidity impairments of a certain 
magnitude. The SEC has provided a period of two years 
following the effective date of the rule for funds to comply 
with these structural changes. Ł Regulation of interchange transaction fees (the Durbin 
Amendment). On October 1, 2011, the FRB rule enacted to implement the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act 
that limits debit card interchange transaction fees to those 
reasonable and proportional to the cost of the transaction 
became effective. The rule generally established that the 
maximum allowable interchange fee that an issuer may 
receive or charge for an electronic debit transaction is the 
sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points 
multiplied by the value of the transaction. On July 31, 2013, 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled 
that the approach used by the FRB in setting the maximum 
allowable interchange transaction fee impermissibly 
included costs that were specifically excluded from 
consideration under the Durbin Amendment. In August 
2013, the FRB filed a notice of appeal of the decision to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
In March 2014, the Court of Appeals reversed the District 
Court™s decision, but did direct the FRB to provide further 
explanation regarding its treatment of the costs of 
monitoring transactions. The plaintiffs did not file a petition 
for rehearing with the Court of Appeals but filed a petition 
for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. In 
January 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition 
for writ of certiorari. Regulatory Capital Guidelines and Capital Plans 
During 2013, federal banking regulators issued final rules that 
substantially amended the risk-based capital rules for banking 
organizations. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory 
capital reforms in the U.S., comply with changes required by the 
Dodd-Frank Act, and replace the existing Basel I-based capital 
requirements. We were required to begin complying with the 
rules on January 1, 2014, subject to phase-in periods that are 
scheduled to be fully phased in by January 1, 2022. In 2014, 
federal banking regulators also finalized rules to impose a 
supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo 
and our insured depository institutions and to implement the 
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio. For more information on the 
final capital, leverage and liquidity rules, and additional capital 
requirements under consideration by federal banking regulators, 
see the ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section in this Report. ﬁLiving Willﬂ Requirements and Related Matters Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically revise resolution plans, so-called 
ﬁliving-willsﬂ, that would facilitate their resolution in the event of 
material distress or failure. Under the rules, resolution plans are 
required to provide strategies for resolution under the 
Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency regimes that 107  Regulatory Reform (continued) can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that mitigates the risk that failure would have serious 
adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. 
Wells Fargo submitted its second annual resolution plan under 
these rules on June 26, 2014. On November 25, 2014, the FRB 
and FDIC announced that our 2014 resolution plan submission 
provided a basis for a resolution strategy that could facilitate an 
orderly resolution under bankruptcy; however, they identified 
specific shortcomings in the 2014 resolution plan that would 
need to be addressed in the 2015 resolution plan. If the FRB and 
FDIC determine that our resolution plan is deficient, the Dodd-
Frank Act authorizes the FRB and FDIC to impose more 
stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or 
restrict our growth or activities until we submit a plan 
remedying the deficiencies. If the FRB and FDIC ultimately 
determine that we have been unable to remedy the deficiencies, 
they could order us to divest assets or operations in order to 
facilitate our orderly resolution in the event of our material 
distress or failure. Our national bank subsidiary, Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., is also required to prepare a resolution plan for the Critical Accounting Policies€FDIC under separate regulatory authority and submitted its 
second annual resolution plan on June 26, 2014. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes an orderly liquidation process which allows for the appointment of the FDIC as a 
receiver of a systemically important financial institution that is 
in default or in danger of default. The FDIC has issued rules to 
implement its orderly liquidation authority and released a notice 
and request for comment regarding a proposed resolution 
strategy, known as ﬁsingle point of entry,ﬂ designed to resolve a 
large financial institution in a manner that holds management 
responsible for its failure, maintains market stability, and 
imposes losses on shareholders and creditors in accordance with 
statutory priorities, without imposing a cost on U.S. taxpayers. 
Implementation of the strategy would require that institutions 
maintain a sufficient amount of available equity and unsecured 
debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. The 
FDIC has not issued any final statements on the single point of 
entry resolution strategy. Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
Ł the allowance for credit losses; Ł PCI loans; Ł the valuation of residential MSRs; Ł the fair valuation of financial instruments; and Ł income taxes. Management and the Board's Audit and Examination committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies. Allowance for Credit Losses We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which consists of the 
allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit 
commitments, which is management™s estimate of credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans carried 
at fair value. For a description of our related accounting policies, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. Changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net 
income. In applying the review and judgment required to 
determine the allowance for credit losses, management 
considers changes in economic conditions, customer behavior, 
and collateral value, among other influences. From time to time, 
economic factors or business decisions, such as the addition or 
liquidation of a loan product or business unit, may affect the 
loan portfolio, causing management to provide or release 
amounts from the allowance for credit losses. While our 
methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments (commercial and consumer), the entire 
allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
inherent in the total loan portfolio and unfunded credit 
commitments. Judgment is specifically applied in: Ł Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans 
and unfunded credit commitments. We estimate the probability of default in accordance with the borrower™s 
financial strength using a borrower quality rating and the 
severity of loss in the event of default using a collateral 
quality rating. Collectively, these ratings are referred to as 
credit risk ratings and are assigned to our commercial loans. 
Probability of default and severity at the time of default are 
statistically derived through historical observations of 
defaults and losses after default within each credit risk 
rating. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on 
each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are 
subject to periodic review by an internal team of credit 
specialists. Ł Economic assumptions applied to pools of consumer loans 
(statistically modeled). Losses are estimated using economic variables to represent our best estimate of 
inherent loss. Our forecasted losses are modeled using a 
range of economic scenarios. Ł Selection of a credit loss estimation model that fits the 
credit risk characteristics of its portfolio. We use both internally developed and vendor supplied models in this 
process. We often use expected loss, roll rate, net flow, 
vintage maturation, behavior score, and time series or 
statistical trend models, most with economic correlations. 
Management must use judgment in establishing additional 
input metrics for the modeling processes, considering 
further stratification into reference data time series, sub-
product, origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic 
location and other predictive characteristics. The models 
used to determine the allowance are validated by an internal 
model validation group operating in accordance with 
Company policies. Ł Assessment of limitations to credit loss estimation models. 
We apply our judgment to adjust or supplement our 
modeled estimates to reflect other risks that may be 108 €identified from current conditions and developments in selected portfolios. Ł Identification and measurement of impaired loans, 
including loans modified in a TDR. Our experienced senior credit officers may consider a loan impaired based on their 
evaluation of current information and events, including 
loans modified in a TDR. The measurement of impairment 
is typically based on an analysis of the present value of 
expected future cash flows. The development of these 
expectations requires significant management review and 
judgment. Ł An amount for imprecision or uncertainty which reflects 
management™s overall estimate of the effect of quantitative 
and qualitative factors on inherent credit losses. This amount represents management™s judgment of risks 
inherent in the processes and assumptions used in 
establishing the allowance. This imprecision considers 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES Table 64 demonstrates the impact of the sensitivity of our estimates on our allowance for credit 
losses. Table 64: Allowance Sensitivity Summary 
December 31, 2014 Estimated increase / (decrease) (in billions) in allowance Assumption: Favorable (1) $ (2.5) 
Adverse (2) 7.8 (1) Represents a one risk rating upgrade throughout our commercial portfolio

segment, a more pessimistic economic outlook for modeled losses on our 
consumer portfolio segment, and incremental deterioration for PCI loans. 
The sensitivity analyses provided in the previous table are hypothetical scenarios and are not considered probable. They do 
not represent management™s view of inherent losses in the 
portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Because significant 
judgment is used, it is possible that others performing similar 
analyses could reach different conclusions. See the ﬁRisk 
Management - Credit Risk Management - Allowance for Credit 
Lossesﬂ section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for further 
discussion of our allowance for credit losses. Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) Loans Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their 
origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all 
contractually required principal and interest payments are PCI 
loans. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the 
Wachovia acquisition on December 31, 2008. For a description 
of our related accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We apply judgment for PCI loans in: Ł identifying loans that meet the PCI criteria at acquisition 
based on our evaluation of credit quality deterioration using 
indicators such as past due and nonaccrual status, commercial risk ratings, recent borrower credit scores and 
recent loan-to-value percentages. Ł determining initial fair value at acquisition, which is based 
on an estimate of cash flows, both principal and interest, 
expected to be collected, discounted at the prevailing market 
rate of interest. We estimate the cash flows expected to be 
collected at acquisition using our internal credit risk, 
interest rate risk and prepayment risk models, which 
incorporate our best estimate of current key assumptions, 
such as property values, default rates, loss severity and 
prepayment speeds. Our estimation includes the timing and 
amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Ł regularly evaluating our estimates of cash flows expected to 
be collected, subsequent to acquisition. These evaluations, 
performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key 
assumptions and estimates, similar to our initial estimate of 
fair value. We must apply judgment to develop our 
estimates of cash flows for PCI loans given the impact of 
changes in value of underlying collateral such as home price 
and property value changes, changing loss severities, 
modification activity, and prepayment speeds. The amount of cash flows expected to be collected and, accordingly, the appropriateness of the allowance for loan loss due to certain decreases in cash flows expected to be collected, is 
particularly sensitive to changes in loan credit quality. The 
sensitivity of the overall allowance for credit losses, including 
PCI loans, is presented in the preceding section, ﬁCritical 
Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses.ﬂ See the ﬁRisk Management - Credit Risk Management -Purchased Credit Impaired Loansﬂ section and Note 6 (Loans 
and Allowance for Credit Losses - Purchased Credit Impaired 
Loans") to Financial Statements in this Report for further 
discussion of PCI loans. Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing 
Rights (MSRs) MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we purchase 
servicing rights from third parties, or retain servicing rights in 
connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate 
(asset transfers). We also have MSRs acquired in the past under 
co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that 
were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and 
the economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are 
reflected in earnings. We use a model to estimate the fair value of our residential MSRs. The model is validated by an internal model 
validation group operating in accordance with Company 
policies. The model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income and incorporates inputs and 
assumptions that market participants use in estimating fair 
value. Certain significant inputs and assumptions are not 
observable in the market and require judgment to determine: 
Ł The mortgage loan prepayment speed used to estimate 
future net servicing income. The prepayment speed is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their 
mortgage loan principal. Prepayment speeds are influenced 
by changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower 
behavior, including estimates for borrower default. Ł The discount rate used to present value estimated future 
net servicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset 109 Critical Accounting Policies (continued) with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties from servicing 
operations (e.g., possible changes in future servicing costs, 
ancillary income and earnings on escrow accounts). Ł The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future 
net servicing income. The cost to service loans includes estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing processes 
associated with default and foreclosure management. Both prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions can, and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in 
the future. Additionally, while our current valuation reflects our 
best estimate of servicing costs, future regulatory changes in 
servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state 
foreclosure legislation, may have an impact on our servicing cost 
assumption and our MSR valuation in future periods. For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the 
financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine 
fair value disclosures. For example, trading assets, securities 
available for sale, derivatives and substantially all of our 
residential MHFS are carried at fair value each period. Other 
financial instruments, such as certain MHFS and loans held for 
investment, are not carried at fair value each period but may 
require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due to application 
of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of 
individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair value for 
financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans 
held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. The accounting provisions for fair value measurements include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable 
or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or 
market-based information obtained from independent sources, 
while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market 
data. For additional information on fair value levels, see Note 17 
(Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of 
unobservable inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in 
active markets to measure fair value. If quoted prices in active 
markets are not available, fair value measurement is based upon 
models that use primarily market-based or independently 
sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, 
prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. 
However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for 
model-based valuation techniques are not readily available, we 
are required to make judgments about assumptions market 
participants would use to estimate fair value. Additionally, we 
use third party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are 
used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate 
internally developed prices. For additional information on our 
use of pricing services, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 17 (Fair Value of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent 
upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or 
observable market parameters. For financial instruments with 
quoted market prices or observable market parameters in active 
markets, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair 
value. When quoted prices and observable data in active markets 
are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to 
estimate fair value. Changes in the market conditions, such as 
reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary 
market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of 
quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value. 
When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or 
inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based 
primarily on unobservable inputs. When an active market for a 
financial instrument does not exist, the use of management 
estimates that incorporate current market participant 
expectations of future cash flows, adjusted for an appropriate 
risk premium, is acceptable. Significant judgment is also required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider available 
information, including observable market data, indications of 
market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the 
valuation techniques and significant inputs used. For securities 
in inactive markets, we use a predetermined percentage to 
evaluate the impact of fair value adjustments derived from 
weighting both external and internal indications of value to 
determine if the instrument is classified as Level 2 or Level 3. 
Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon 
the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or 
instrument category and judgments are made regarding the 
significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments™ fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered 
significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Table 65 presents the summary of the fair value of financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the 
amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before 
derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining 
assets and liabilities were measured using valuation 
methodologies involving market-based or market-derived 
information (collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements). 110 €Table 65: Fair Value Level 3 Summary

See Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement 
techniques and the impact to our financial statements. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and 
municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we 
operate.€Our income tax expense consists of current and 
deferred income tax expense.€Current income tax expense 
represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the 
current period and includes income tax expense related to our 
uncertain tax positions.€We determine deferred income taxes 
using the balance sheet method.€Under this method, the net 
deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the 
differences between the book and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws 
in the period in which they occur.€Deferred income tax expense 
results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
between periods.€Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to 
management™s judgment that realization is ﬁmore likely than 
not.ﬂ Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not 
recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of 
benefit to recognize.€An uncertain tax position is measured at the 
largest amount of benefit that management believes has a 
greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.€Tax 
benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent 
unrecognized tax benefits. Our unrecognized tax benefits on 
uncertain tax positions are reflected in Note 21 (Income Taxes) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. Foreign taxes paid are 
generally applied as credits to reduce federal income taxes 
payable.€We account for interest and penalties as a component of 
income tax expense. The€income tax laws€of the jurisdictions in which we€operate€are complex and subject to different interpretations 
by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. 
In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must 
make judgments and interpretations about the application of 
these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates 
about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income 
in the various tax jurisdictions by the government taxing 
authorities, both domestic and foreign.€Our interpretations may 
be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities 
and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions.€We 
attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and 
audit process and ultimately through the court systems when 
applicable. We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 
taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and 
from the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions 
in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any 
given quarter. See Note 21 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report for a further description of our provision for income 
taxes and related income tax assets and liabilities. 111    Current Accounting Developments The following table provides accounting pronouncements applicable to us that have been issued by the FASB but are not yet effective. Effective date and financial Standard Description statement impact Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2015-02 - Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis The Update primarily amends the criteria companies use to evaluate whether they 
should consolidate certain variable 
interest entities that have fee 
arrangements and the criteria used to 
determine whether partnerships and 
similar entities are variable interest 
entities . The Update also excludes 
registered 2a-7 money market funds 
(including unregistered funds that 
operate in a similar manner) from the 
consolidation guidance. The changes are effective for us in first 
quarter 2016 with early adoption 
permitted. We are evaluating the impact 
the Update will have on our consolidated 
financial statements. ASU 2015-01 -Income Statement -Extraordinary and Unusual Items 
(Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income 
Statement Presentation by Eliminating 
the Concept of Extraordinary Items The Update removes the concept of 
extraordinary items from GAAP and 
eliminates the requirement for 
extraordinary items to be separately 
presented in the statement of income. The Update is effective for us in first 
quarter 2016 with prospective or 
retrospective application. Early adoption 
is permitted. The Update will not have a 
material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements. ASU 2014-16 -Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or Equity The Update clarifies that the nature of host contracts in hybrid financial 
instruments that are issued in share form 
should be determined based on the entire 
instrument, including the embedded 
derivative. The Update is effective for us in first 
quarter 2016 with retrospective 
application. The Update will not have a 
material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements. ASU 2014-13 -Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity The Update provides a measurement alternative to companies that consolidate 
collateralized financing entities (CFEs), 
such as collateralized debt obligation and 
collateralized loan obligation structures. 
Under the new guidance, companies can 
measure both the financial assets and 
financial liabilities of a CFE using the 
more observable fair value of the financial 
assets or of the financial liabilities. These changes are effective for us in first 
quarter 2016 with early adoption 
permitted at the beginning of an annual 
period. The guidance can be applied 
either retrospectively or by a modified 
retrospective approach. The Update will 
not have a material impact on our 
consolidated financial statements. ASU 2014-12 -Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting 
for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period The Update provides accounting guidance for employee share-based payment 
awards with specific performance targets. 
The Update clarifies that performance 
targets should be treated as performance 
conditions if the targets affect vesting and 
could be achieved after the requisite 
service period. The Update is effective for us in first 
quarter 2016 with early adoption 
permitted and can be applied 
prospectively or retrospectively. This 
Update will not have a material impact on 
our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2014-11 -Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures maturity transactions to be accounted for 
as secured borrowings versus sales. The 
guidance also requires separate 
accounting for transfers of financial assets 
that are executed contemporaneously 
with repurchase agreements. The Update 
also includes new disclosures for transfers 
accounted for as sales and for repurchase 
agreements and similar arrangements, 
such as classes of collateral pledged for 
gross obligations and the remaining 
contractual maturity of repurchase 
agreements. The accounting changes are effective for 
us in first quarter 2015 with early 
adoption prohibited. The disclosures are 
required in first quarter 2015 for transfers 
accounted for as sales with the remaining 
disclosures required in second quarter 
2015. This Update will not have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial 
statements. 112   Effective date and financial StandardDescription statement impact ASU 2014-09 -Revenue from Contracts With Customers (Topic 606) The Update modifies the guidance companies use to recognize revenue from 
contracts with customers for transfers of 
goods or services and transfers of 
nonfinancial assets, unless those 
contracts are within the scope of other 
standards. The guidance also requires 
new qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures, including information about 
contract balances and performance 
obligations. The Update is effective for us in first 
quarter 2017 with retrospective 
application. Early adoption is not 
permitted. We are evaluating the impact 
this Update will have on our consolidated 
financial statements. ASU 2014-08 -Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity The Update changes the definition and reporting requirements for discontinued 
operations. Under the new guidance, an 
entity™s disposal of a component or group 
of components must be reported in 
discontinued operations if the disposal is 
a strategic shift that has or will have a 
significant effect on the entity™s 
operations and financial results. These changes are effective for us in first 
quarter 2015 with prospective application. 
Early adoption is permitted for disposals 
that have not been previously reported. 
This Update will not have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial 
statements. ASU 2014-01 -Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects The Update amends the accounting guidance for investments in affordable 
housing projects that qualify for the low-
income housing tax credit. The Update 
allows companies to make an accounting 
policy election to amortize the cost of its 
investments in proportion to the tax 
benefits received if certain criteria are met 
and present the amortization as a 
component of income tax expense. 
Additionally, the Update requires 
incremental disclosures for all entities 
that invest in qualified affordable housing 
projects regardless of the policy election. The new disclosure requirements are 
effective for us in first quarter 2015. We 
do not intend to adopt the accounting 
policy election permitted by the Update, 
and therefore, it will not affect our 
consolidated financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains ﬁforward-looking statementsﬂ within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our 
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as 
ﬁanticipates,ﬂ ﬁintends,ﬂ ﬁplans,ﬂ ﬁseeks,ﬂ ﬁbelieves,ﬂ ﬁestimates,ﬂ ﬁexpects,ﬂ ﬁtarget,ﬂ ﬁprojects,ﬂ ﬁoutlook,ﬂ ﬁforecast,ﬂ ﬁwill,ﬂ ﬁmay,ﬂ ﬁcould,ﬂ ﬁshould,ﬂ ﬁcanﬂ and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but 
are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future 
operating or financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance releases; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or 
mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital levels 
and our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III 
capital standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage 
business and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome 
and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as 
well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) 
future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets 
and return on equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as 
legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company™s plans, objectives and 
strategies. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 
Ł current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and the overall slowdown in 
global economic growth;€Ł our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 113 €€€    Forward-Looking Statements (continued) standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; Ł financial services reform and other current, pending or 
future legislation or regulation that could have a negative 
effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-
Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to 
bank products and services; Ł the extent of our success in our loan modification efforts, as 
well as the effects of regulatory requirements or guidance 
regarding loan modifications; Ł the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we 
receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without 
having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise 
indemnify or reimburse third parties, and the credit quality 
of or losses on such repurchased mortgage loans; Ł negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing and 
foreclosure practices, including our obligations under the 
settlement with the Department of Justice and other federal 
and state government entities, as well as changes in industry 
standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, 
penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or 
obligations, including loan modification requirements, or 
delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; Ł our ability to realize our efficiency ratio target as part of our 
expense management initiatives, including as a result of 
business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in 
our business composition and operating environment, 
growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and 
unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; Ł the effect of the current low interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net 
interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage 
servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; Ł a recurrence of significant turbulence or disruption in the 
capital or financial markets, which could result in, among 
other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a 
reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding 
costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of 
other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our 
investment securities portfolio; Ł the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; Risk Factors Ł reputational damage from negative publicity, protests, fines, 
penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory 
violations and legal actions; Ł a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber 
attacks; Ł the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; Ł fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
and Ł the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ in this Report. In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), 
common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and 
regulations (including federal securities laws and federal 
banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company™s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ in this Report, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.€Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause 
our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it 
is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no 
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company. RISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES AND LIQUIDITY As one of the largest lenders in the U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and 
businesses across the U.S. and internationally, our 
financial results have been, and will continue to be, 
materially affected by general€economic conditions, 

particularly unemployment levels and home prices in 
the U.S., and a deterioration in economic conditions or 
in the financial markets may materially adversely affect 
our lending and other businesses and our financial 
results and condition.€We generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and 
services we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and 
earnings comes from the net interest income and fee income that 
we earn from our consumer and commercial lending and 
banking businesses, including our mortgage banking business 
where we currently are the largest mortgage originator in the 
U.S. These businesses have been, and will continue to be, 
materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly 
unemployment levels and home prices. Although the U.S. 
economy has continued to gradually improve from the depressed 
levels of 2008 and early 2009, economic growth has been slow 
and uneven. In addition, the negative effects and continued 
uncertainty stemming from U.S. fiscal and political matters, 114 € €including concerns about deficit levels, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact the 
continuing global economic recovery. Moreover, geopolitical 
matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, 
as well as continued concerns over energy prices and global 
economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial 
markets and the global economy. A prolonged period of slow 
growth in the global economy, particularly in the U.S., or any 
deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the 
financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other 
events or factors that may disrupt or dampen the global 
economic recovery,€could materially adversely affect our 
financial€results and condition.€The improvement in the U.S. economy as well as higher home prices contributed to our strengthened credit performance 
and allowed us to release amounts from our allowance for credit 
losses, however there is no guarantee we will have allowance 
releases in the future. If unemployment levels worsen€or if home 
prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and 
provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit 
losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer 
loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially 
for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries 
that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The 
ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may 
deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial lenders 
and the largest CRE lender in the U.S., to incur significantly 
higher credit losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic 
conditions make it more challenging for us to increase our 
consumer and commercial loan portfolios by making loans to 
creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. Although we have 
significant capacity to add loans to our balance sheet, weak 
economic conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in 
interest rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our 
retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets 
on our balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to 
improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, 
which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and 
business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit 
products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our 
interest and noninterest income and our earnings. A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including 
our investment advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, 
wealth management, and investment banking businesses. In 
2014, approximately 26% of our revenue was fee income, which 
included trust and investment fees, card fees and other fees. We 
earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing 
brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth 
management services. Because investment management fees are 
often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in 
the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. 
Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity 
of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from 
our brokerage business. The U.S. stock market experienced all-
time highs in 2014 and there is no guarantee that those price 
levels will continue. Poor economic conditions and volatile or 
unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt 
and equity underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our 
trading and venture capital businesses. Any deterioration in 
global financial markets and economies, including as a result of 
any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely 
affect the revenues and earnings of our international operations, particularly our global financial institution and correspondent 
banking services. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Managementﬂ and ﬁŒ Credit Risk Managementﬂ 
sections in this Report. Changes in interest rates and financial market values could reduce our net interest income and earnings, 
including as a result of recognizing losses or OTTI on 
the securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for 
our customers. Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans, debt securities and other assets we hold less 
the interest we pay on our deposits, long-term and short-term 
debt, and other liabilities. Net interest income is a measure of 
both our net interest margin Œ the difference between the yield 
we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits 
and our other sources of funding Œ and the amount of earning 
assets we hold. Changes in either our net interest margin or the 
amount or mix of earning assets we hold could affect our net 
interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can 
affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our 
assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction 
in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster 
than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or 
contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our 
assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in 
interest rates. When interest rates rise, our funding costs may 
rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net 
interest margin to contract until the asset yield increases. The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and investment securities, among other assets. As 
noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower demand 
for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our net interest 
income and yield. In addition, our net interest income and net 
interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged low 
interest rate environment, which as noted below is currently 
being experienced as a result of economic conditions and FRB 
monetary policies, as it may result in us holding short-term 
lower yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet, 
particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher 
yielding assets, including the loans in our non-strategic and 
liquidating loan portfolio, with similar higher yielding assets. 
Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan 
demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers 
may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As 
described below, changes in interest rates also affect our 
mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. Changes in the slope of the ﬁyield curveﬂ Œ or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates Œ could also 
reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is 

term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration 
than our assets, when the yield curve flattens, as is the case in 
the current interest rate environment, or even inverts, our net 
interest margin could decrease as our cost of funds increases 
relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. denominated interest rates such as the federal funds rate while 
the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international 
rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without 
a corresponding decrease in LIBOR, we might earn less on our 
loans without any offsetting decrease in our funding costs. This 
could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. 115 € €Risk Factors (continued) We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We hedge 
some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. We 
also rely on the ﬁnatural hedgeﬂ that our mortgage loan 
originations and servicing rights can provide. We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our 
net interest income and our earnings in material amounts, 
especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different 
than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall 
faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes, 
we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as 
investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance 
our investment and loan portfolios, refinance our debt and take 
other strategic actions. We may incur losses when we take such 
actions. We hold securities in our investment securities portfolio, including U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal 
agency MBS, securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, 
residential and commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, 
other asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities, 
including securities relating to our venture capital activities. We 
analyze securities held in our investment securities portfolio for 
OTTI on at least a quarterly basis. The process for determining 
whether impairment is other than temporary usually requires 
difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial 
performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the 
security in order to assess the probability of receiving 
contractual principal and interest payments on the security. 
Because of changing economic and market conditions, as well as 
credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of the 
underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize OTTI in 
future periods. Our net income also is exposed to changes in 
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices in connection with our trading activities, 
which are conducted primarily to accommodate our customers 
in the management of their market price risk, as well as when we 
take positions based on market expectations or to benefit from 
differences between financial instruments and markets. The 
securities held in these activities are carried at fair value with 
realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest 
income. As part of our business to support our customers, we 
trade public securities and these securities also are subject to 
market fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net 
income when realized and periodically include OTTI charges. 
Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the 
risks associated with our trading activities, including stress 
testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that 
our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding losses 
that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The value of our public and private equity investments can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.€Certain of these investments 
are carried under the cost or equity method, while others are 
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in 
earnings. Earnings from our equity investments may be volatile 
and hard to predict, and may have a significant effect on our 
earnings from period to period. When, and if, we recognize gains 
may depend on a number of factors, including general economic 
and market conditions, the prospects of the companies in which 
we invest, when a company goes public, the size of our position 
relative to the public float, and whether we are subject to any 
resale restrictions. Our venture capital investments could result in significant OTTI losses for those investments carried under the cost or 
equity method. Our assessment for OTTI is based on a number 
of factors, including the then current market value of each 
investment compared with its carrying value. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings. The 
amount of this charge could be significant. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Management Œ Interest Rate Riskﬂ, ﬁŒ Market 
Risk Œ Equity Investmentsﬂ, and ﬁŒ Market Risk Œ Trading 
Activitiesﬂ and the ﬁBalance Sheet Analysis Œ Investment 
Securitiesﬂ sections in this Report and Note 5 (Investment 
Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. Effective liquidity management, which ensures that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit 
maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments, 
including principal and interest payments on our debt, 
efficiently under both normal operating conditions and 
other unpredictable circumstances of industry or 
financial market stress, is essential for the operation of 
our business, and our financial results and condition 
could be materially adversely affected if we do not 
effectively manage our liquidity. Our liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. We primarily rely on bank 
deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the 
loans we make and the operation of our business. Core customer 
deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-
bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and 
other savings, and certain foreign deposits, have historically 
provided us with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-
cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of 
liquidity include investments in our securities portfolio, our 
ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 
pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic 
and international money through capital markets. Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 
disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 
that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 
interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a 
lack of market or customer confidence in the Company or 
negative news about the Company or the financial services 
industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits 
and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; 
our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and, as 
described below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. 
Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by 
events over which we have little or no control. While market 
conditions have continued to improve since the financial crisis, 
there can be no assurance that significant disruption and 
volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For 
example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and 116 € €€ €€€currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. In addition, concerns regarding the potential failure to raise the U.S. government debt limit and any associated downgrade of 
U.S. government debt ratings may cause uncertainty and 
volatility as well. A failure to raise the U.S. debt limit in the 
future and/or additional downgrades of the sovereign debt 
ratings of the U.S. government or the debt ratings of related 
institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal 
or political events could, in addition to causing economic and 
financial market disruptions, materially adversely affect the 
market value of the U.S. government securities that we hold, the 
availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and 
our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well 
as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our 
business and our financial results and condition. As noted above, we rely heavily on bank deposits for our funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other 
financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors 
raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may 
increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing 
deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more 
expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our 
net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and 
savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits 
may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, 
such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return 
tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and 
into other investments, we may lose a relatively low cost source 
of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting 
our liquidity. If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable 
terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or 
otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, 
net interest margin, financial results and condition may be 
materially adversely affected. As we did during the financial 
crisis, we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to 
raise€additional capital through the issuance of common stock, 
which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or 
reduce or even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve 
capital or in order to raise additional capital.€For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Managementﬂ section in this Report. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, 
financial results and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. 
Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely 
affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our 
borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business 
counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other 
actions that could adversely affect our ability to raise funding. 
Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies™ outlooks are based on 
the ratings agencies™ analysis of many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset 
quality, business mix, the level and quality of our earnings, 
rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent 
of federal financial assistance or support, and other rating 
agency specific criteria. In addition to credit ratings, our 
borrowing costs are affected by various other external factors, 
including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about 
the financial services industry generally. In light of industry changes and regulatory developments related to the Title II Orderly Liquidation Authority of the Dodd-
Frank Act, rating agencies have proposed changes to various 
aspects of their ratings methodologies. Moody™s Investors 
Service has proposed significant revisions to its rating 
methodology, with a focus on how each type of creditor would be 
affected in any bank failure. Standard and Poor™s Ratings 
Services (S&P) is continuing its reassessment of whether to 
incorporate the likelihood of extraordinary government support 
into the ratings of certain bank holding companies, including the 
Parent. In addition, S&P has recently issued a proposal to 
incorporate into its bank-level rating methodology an 
assessment of additional capital available to absorb losses to 
reduce default risk. There can be no assurance that we will 
maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit ratings 
downgrades in the future would not materially affect our ability 
to borrow funds and borrowing costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect 
our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent 
features in certain of our derivative contracts. Although a one or 
two notch downgrade in our current credit ratings would not be 
expected to trigger a material increase in our collateral or 
funding obligations, a more severe credit rating downgrade of 
our long-term and short-term credit ratings could increase our 
collateral or funding obligations and the effect on our liquidity 
could be material. For information regarding additional 
collateral and funding obligations required of certain derivative 
instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below 
investment grade, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and federal and state law can limit those 
dividends. Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from its 
subsidiaries. It receives a significant portion of its funding and 
liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its 
subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, 
among other things, to pay dividends on our common and 
preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal 
and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions 
that our bank and some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including 
our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to our parent holding 
company. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets 
upon a subsidiary™s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the 
prior claims of the subsidiary™s creditors. For more information, refer to the ﬁRegulation and Supervision Œ Dividend Restrictionsﬂ and ﬁŒ Holding Company 
Structureﬂ sections in our 2014 Form 10-K and to Note 3 (Cash, 
Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and Note 26 (Regulatory and 
Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND 
REGULATIONS Enacted legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or 
regulation, could require us to change certain of our 
business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, 
impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely 
affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position. Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many 117 Risk Factors (continued) of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our brokerage and mutual fund businesses, are subject to significant 
regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the 
applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. 
where we conduct business. These regulations protect 
depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, 
investors and the banking and financial system as a whole, not 
necessarily our stockholders. Economic, market and political 
conditions during the past few years have led to a significant 
amount of new legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad, 
as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of financial 
services companies from banking regulators. These laws and 
regulations may affect the manner in which we do business and 
the products and services that we provide, affect or restrict our 
ability to compete in our current businesses or our ability to 
enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our revenue 
in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on 
us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial 
services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or 
have other negative consequences. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s, became law. The 
Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, (i) established the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk 
posed by financial firms and imposes additional and enhanced 
FRB regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, 
on certain large, interconnected bank holding companies such as 
Wells Fargo and systemically significant nonbanking firms 
intended to promote financial stability; (ii) creates a liquidation 
framework for the resolution of covered financial companies, the 
costs of which would be paid through assessments on surviving 
covered financial companies; (iii) makes significant changes to 
the structure of bank and bank holding company regulation and 
activities in a variety of areas, including prohibiting proprietary 
trading and private fund investment activities, subject to certain 
exceptions; (iv) creates a new framework for the regulation of 
over-the-counter derivatives and new regulations for the 
securitization market and strengthens the regulatory oversight of 
securities and capital markets by the SEC; (v) established the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the FRB, 
which has sweeping powers to administer and enforce a new 
federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation; 
(vi) may limit the existing pre-emption of state laws with respect 
to the application of such laws to national banks, makes federal 
pre-emption no longer applicable to operating subsidiaries of 
national banks, and gives state authorities, under certain 
circumstances, the ability to enforce state laws and federal 
consumer regulations against national banks; (vii) provides for 
increased regulation of residential mortgage activities; (viii) 
revised the FDIC's assessment base for deposit insurance by 
changing from an assessment base defined by deposit liabilities 
to a risk-based system based on total assets; (ix) phases out over 
three years beginning January 2013 the Tier 1 capital treatment 
of trust preferred securities; (x) permitted banks to pay interest 
on business checking accounts beginning on July 1, 2011; (xi) 
authorized the FRB under the Durbin Amendment to adopt 
regulations that limit debit card interchange fees received by 
debit card issuers; and (xii) includes several corporate 
governance and executive compensation provisions and 
requirements, including mandating an advisory stockholder vote 
on executive compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act and many of its provisions became effective in July 2010 and July 2011. However, a number of its 
provisions still require final rulemaking, guidance, and 
interpretation by regulatory authorities. Accordingly, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its 
effects on the U.S. financial system and the Company still remain 
uncertain. Nevertheless, the Dodd-Frank Act, including current 
and future rules implementing its provisions and the 
interpretation of those rules, could result in a loss of revenue, 
require us to change certain of our business practices, limit our 
ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our 
capital requirements and impose additional assessments and 
costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business 
operations and have other negative consequences. Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, 
may be negatively affected by the activities of the CFPB, which 
has broad rulemaking powers and supervisory authority over 
consumer financial products and services. Although the full 
impact of the CFPB on our businesses is uncertain, the CFPB™s 
activities may increase our compliance costs and require changes 
in our business practices as a result of new regulations and 
requirements which could limit or negatively affect the products 
and services that we currently offer our customers. For example, 
in 2013, the CFPB issued a number of new rules impacting 
residential mortgage lending practices. As a result of greater 
regulatory scrutiny of our consumer businesses, we have become 
subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or 
investigations, which also could result in increased costs and 
harm to our reputation in the event of a failure to comply with 
the increased regulatory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act™s proposed prohibitions or limitations on proprietary trading and private fund investment activities, 
known as the ﬁVolcker Rule,ﬂ also may reduce our revenue and 
earnings, although proprietary trading has not been significant 
to our financial results. Rules to implement the requirements of 
the Volcker Rule were first proposed in 2011, and final rules were 
issued in December 2013. Pursuant to an order of the FRB, 
banking entities are required to make good faith planning efforts 
to come into compliance with the Volcker Rule™s restrictions by 
July 21, 2015. The FRB announced that it intends to exercise its 
authority to give banking entities two additional one-year 
extensions to conform their ownership interests in and 
sponsorships of covered funds under the rule. Companies with 
$50 billion or more in trading assets and liabilities such as 
Wells€Fargo were required to report trading metrics beginning 
June 30, 2014. Wells Fargo has begun submitting such metrics 
to the Volcker supervisory regulators. Wells Fargo will also be 
subject to enhanced compliance program requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives and authorized the CFTC and SEC to regulate swaps 
and security-based swaps, respectively. The CFTC and SEC have 
adopted various rules to implement this framework, including 
rules requiring extensive regulatory and public reporting of 
swaps, certain swaps to be centrally cleared and traded on 
exchanges or other multilateral platforms, and comprehensive 
internal and external business conduct standards. Also included 
in this regulatory framework are so-called push-out provisions 
requiring certain swap activities to be conducted through an 
affiliate. All of these rules, as well as others proposed or 
currently being considered by regulators in the U.S. and other 

the-counter derivatives and may increase our costs for engaging 
in swaps and other derivatives activities. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes changes on the ABS markets by requiring sponsors of ABS to hold at least a 5% 
ownership stake in the ABS. Exemptions from the requirement 
include qualified residential mortgages and FHA/VA loans. 118 €Federal regulatory agencies have finalized rules to implement this credit risk retention requirement, which have only included 
limited exemptions. We continue to evaluate the final rules and 
assess their impact on our ability to issue certain ABS or 
otherwise participate in various securitization transactions. In order to address the perceived risks that money market mutual funds may pose to the financial stability of the United 
States, the SEC adopted rules in July 2014 that, among other 
things, require significant structural changes to these funds, 
including requiring institutional prime money market funds to 
maintain a variable net asset value and providing for the 

governmental money market funds during periods in which they 
experience liquidity impairments of a certain magnitude. The 
SEC has provided a period of two years following the effective 
date of the rule for funds to comply with these structural 
changes. Certain of our money market mutual funds may see a 
decline in assets under management in response to 
implementation of these structural changes. Federal banking regulators also continue to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act addressing the risks to the 
financial system posed by the failure of a systemically important 
financial institution. Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB and 
the FDIC, Wells Fargo has prepared and filed a resolution plan, a 
so-called ﬁliving will,ﬂ that is designed to facilitate our resolution 
in the event of material distress or failure. There can be no 
assurance that the FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the 
Company™s resolution plans. If the FRB and FDIC determine that 
our resolution plan is deficient, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes 
the FRB and FDIC to impose more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth or activities 
until we submit a plan remedying the deficiencies. If the FRB 
and FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to 
remedy the deficiencies, they could order us to divest assets or 
operations in order to facilitate our orderly resolution in the 
event of our material distress or failure. Our national bank 
subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is also required to prepare 
and submit a resolution plan to the FDIC under separate 
regulatory authority. The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes an orderly liquidation process which allows for the appointment of the FDIC as a 
receiver of a systemically important financial institution that is 
in default or in danger of default. The FDIC has issued rules to 
implement its orderly liquidation authority and released a notice 
and request for comment regarding a proposed resolution 
strategy, known as ﬁsingle point of entry,ﬂ designed to resolve a 
large financial institution in a manner that would, among other 
things, impose losses on shareholders and creditors in 
accordance with statutory priorities, without imposing a cost on 
U.S. taxpayers.€Implementation of the strategy would require 
that institutions maintain a sufficient amount of available equity 
and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating 
subsidiaries. The FDIC has not issued any final statements on 
the single point of entry resolution strategy. Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the United States. These proposals, among 
other things, consider winding down the GSEs and reducing or 
eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in guaranteeing 
mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as 
the implementation of reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, 
and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the 
maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in 
a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, 
improving underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. 
Congress also may consider the adoption of legislation to reform 
the mortgage financing market in an effort to assist borrowers 
experiencing difficulty in making mortgage payments or 
refinancing their mortgages. The extent and timing of any 
regulatory reform or the adoption of any legislation regarding 
the GSEs and/or the home mortgage market, as well as any 
effect on the Company™s business and financial results, are 
uncertain. Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also could significantly change our regulatory environment and 
increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services 
companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. For more information, refer to the ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ section in this Report and the ﬁRegulation and Supervisionﬂ 
section in our 2014 Form 10-K. Bank regulations, including Basel capital and liquidity standards and FRB guidelines and rules, may require 
higher capital and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to 
pay common stock dividends, repurchase our common 
stock, invest in our business, or provide loans or other 
products and services to our customers.€Federal banking 
regulators continually monitor the capital position of banks and 
bank holding companies. In December 2010, the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) finalized a set of 
international guidelines for determining regulatory capital 
known as Basel III. These guidelines are designed to address 
many of the weaknesses identified in the previous Basel 
standards and in the banking sector as contributing to the 
financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 by, among other things, 
increasing minimum capital requirements, increasing the quality 
of capital, increasing the risk coverage of the capital framework, 
increasing liquidity buffers, and increasing standards for the 
supervisory review process and public disclosure. When fully 
phased in, the Basel III guidelines require bank holding 
companies to maintain a minimum ratio of Common Equity 
Tier€1 (CET1) to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%. U.S. regulatory authorities have been considering the BCBS capital guidelines and related proposals, and in July 2013, U.S. 
banking regulators approved final and interim final rules to 
implement the Basel III capital guidelines for U.S. banks. These 
final capital rules, among other things:€
Ł implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory 
capital reforms including those that revise the definition of 
capital, increase minimum capital ratios, and introduce a 
minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% and a capital conservation 
buffer of 2.5% (for a total minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0%) and 
a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5%, which would 
be imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is 
determined that a period of excessive credit growth is 
contributing to an increase in systemic risk; Ł require a Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets 
ratio of 4% and introduce, for large and internationally 
active bank holding companies (BHCs), a Tier 1 
supplementary leverage ratio of 3% that incorporates off-
balance sheet exposures; Ł revise ﬁBasel Iﬂ rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to 
enhance risk sensitivity under a standardized approach; Ł modify the existing Basel II advanced approaches rules for 
calculating risk-weighted assets to implement Basel III; 119 €€Risk Factors (continued) Ł deduct certain assets from CET1, such as deferred tax assets that could not be realized through net operating loss carry-
backs, significant investments in non-consolidated financial 
entities, and mortgage servicing rights, to the extent any one 
category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the 
aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1; Ł eliminate the accumulated other comprehensive income or 
loss filter that applies under risk-based capital rules over a 
five-year phase in period beginning in 2014; and Ł comply with the Dodd-Frank Act provision prohibiting the 
reliance on external credit ratings. The final capital rules became effective for Wells Fargo in January 2014, with certain provisions subject to phase-in periods. The Basel III capital rules are scheduled to be fully 
phased in by January 1, 2022. In April 2014, federal banking regulators finalized a rule that enhances the supplementary leverage ratio requirements 
provided in the final capital rules for large BHCs, like 
Wells€Fargo, and their insured depository institutions. The rule, 
which becomes effective on January 1, 2018, will require a 
covered BHC to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at 
least 5% to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments and require that its insured 
depository institutions maintain a supplementary leverage ratio 
of 6% to be considered well capitalized. In addition, in 
September 2014, federal banking regulators issued a final rule 
that implements a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent 
with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) originally established by 
the BCBS. The rule requires banking institutions, such as 
Wells€Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as central 
bank reserves and government and corporate debt that can be 
converted easily and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. The final LCR rule will be phased in beginning 
January 1, 2015, and requires full compliance with a minimum 
100% LCR by January 1, 2017. The FRB also recently finalized 
rules imposing enhanced liquidity management standards on 
large BHCs such as Wells Fargo. The FRB has also indicated that it is in the process of considering new rules to address the amount of equity and 
unsecured debt a company must hold to facilitate its orderly 
liquidation, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC). In November 2014, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 
issued for public consultation policy proposals on TLAC. Under 
the FSB™s TLAC proposal, global systemically important banks 
(G-SIBs) would be required to hold loss absorbing equity and 
unsecured debt of 16-20% of RWAs, with at least 33% of this 
total being unsecured debt rather than equity. The FRB will 
likely propose related rules sometime after the FSB™s public 
consultation on the TLAC proposal ends. In addition, in December 2014, the FRB proposed rules to implement an additional CET1 capital surcharge on those U.S. 
banking organizations, such as the Company, that have been 
designated by the FSB as G-SIBs. The G-SIB surcharge would be 
in addition to the minimum Basel III 7.0% CET1 requirement. 
Under the FRB proposal, estimated surcharges for G-SIBs would 
range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of a firm™s RWAs depending on 
methodologies that look at, among other things, the firm™s 
systemic importance and use of short-term wholesale funding. 
The G-SIB surcharge would be phased in beginning on January 
1, 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019. The ultimate impact of all of these finalized and proposed or contemplated rules on our capital and liquidity requirements 
will depend on final rulemaking and regulatory interpretation of the rules as we, along with our regulatory authorities, apply the 
final rules during the implementation process. As part of its obligation to impose enhanced capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms pursuant to 
the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB issued a final capital plan rule that 
became effective December 30, 2011. The final capital plan rule 
requires top-tier BHCs, including the Company, to submit 
annual capital plans for review and to obtain regulatory approval 
before making capital distributions. There can be no assurance 
that the FRB would respond favorably to the Company™s future 
capital plans. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations 
implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs 
like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk 
and liquidity management, and imposing debt-to-equity limits 
on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave threat to the 
financial stability of the United States. The FRB and OCC have 
also finalized rules implementing stress testing requirements for 
large BHCs and national banks. The FRB has also proposed, but 
not yet finalized, remediation requirements for large BHCs 
experiencing financial distress that would restrict capital 
distributions upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, or risk 
and liquidity management triggers.€The OCC, under separate 
authority, has also established heightened governance and risk 
management standards for large national banks, such as 
Wells€Fargo Bank, N.A. The Basel standards and FRB regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we 
utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock 
repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or 
liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory 
capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to 
liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product 
offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect 
our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, 
proposed capital requirements and/or our regulators may 
require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing 
additional common stock may dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may 
increase our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest 
in our business or provide loans or other products and services 
to our customers. For more information, refer to the ﬁCapital 
Managementﬂ and ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ sections in this Report 
and the ﬁRegulation and Supervisionﬂ section of our 2014 
Form€10-K. FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can significantly affect business and economic conditions 
and our financial results and condition.€The FRB regulates the supply of money in the United States. Its policies 
determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and 
investing and the return we earn on those loans and 
investments, both of which affect our net interest income and 
net interest margin. The FRB™s interest rate policies also can 
materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such 
as debt securities and MSRs. In addition, its policies can affect 
our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail 
to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our 
control and can be hard to predict. The FRB recently reaffirmed 
the target range for the federal funds rate at near zero as it 
continues to assess U.S. unemployment rates and the FRB™s two 
percent inflation target. The FRB has indicated that it will 
consider a wide range of information, such as additional labor 
market and financial market conditions, in its determination of 
how long to maintain the current target range. The FRB has 
stated that it intends to be patient before beginning to increase 120 €€    €€the level of the federal funds rate. As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and a flattening yield curve which 
may result from the FRB™s actions could negatively affect our net 
interest income and net interest margin as it may result in us 
holding lower yielding loans and investment securities on our 
balance sheet. RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT AND OUR MORTGAGE BUSINESS As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions, could require us to increase our 

provision for credit losses and allowance for credit 

losses and could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations and financial condition. When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the 
risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of 
the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance of our loan 
portfolios significantly affects our financial results and 
condition. As noted above, if the current economic environment 
were to deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in 
repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a 
higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We 
reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a 
charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our 
assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for 
determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our 
financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of 
economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of 
our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the 
allowance because of changing economic conditions, including 
falling home prices and higher unemployment, significant loan 
growth, or other factors. For example, if oil prices remain low for 
a prolonged period of time, we may have to increase the 
allowance, particularly to cover potential losses on loans to 
customers in the energy sector. Additionally, the regulatory 
environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, also 
can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios 
and impact our allowance for credit losses. Reflecting the continued improved credit performance in our loan portfolios, our provision for credit losses was 
$1.6€billion and $2.2€billion less than net charge-offs in 2014 and 
2013, respectively, which had a positive effect on our earnings. 
Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance 
and general economic conditions. While we believe that our 
allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 
2014, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover 
future credit losses, especially if housing and employment 
conditions worsen. In the event of significant deterioration in 
economic conditions or if we experience significant loan growth, 
we may be required to build reserves in future periods, which 
would reduce our earnings. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Managementﬂ and ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ 
Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ sections in this Report. We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, 
industry segment, borrower type, or location of the 
borrower or collateral. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. We experienced the effect of concentration 
risk in 2009 and 2010 when we incurred greater than expected 
losses in our residential real estate loan portfolio due to a 
housing slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in 
residential real estate values in many markets, including the 
Central Valley California market and several Southern California 
metropolitan statistical areas. As California is our largest 
banking state in terms of loans and deposits, deterioration in 
real estate values and underlying economic conditions in those 
markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially 

economic conditions generally across the country could result in 
materially higher credit losses, including for our residential real 
estate loan portfolio. We may experience higher delinquencies 
and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate secured lines of 
credit reach their contractual end of draw period and begin to 
amortize. Additionally, we may experience higher delinquencies 
and higher loss rates as borrowers in our consumer Pick-a-Pay 
portfolio reach their recast trigger, particularly if interest rates 
increase significantly which may cause more borrowers to 
experience a payment increase of more than 7.5% upon recast. We are currently the largest CRE lender in the U.S. A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the 
business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases 
in interest rates and/or declines in commercial property values, 
could result in materially higher credit losses and have a 
material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.€Challenging economic conditions in Europe have increased our foreign credit risk. Although our foreign loan exposure 
represented only approximately 6% of our total consolidated 
outstanding loans and 3% of our total assets at 
December€31,€2014, continued European economic difficulties 
could indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit 
performance and results of operations and financial condition to 
the extent it negatively affects the U.S. economy and/or our 
borrowers who have foreign operations.€For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Managementﬂ section and Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We may incur losses on loans, securities and other acquired assets of Wachovia that are materially greater 
than reflected in our fair value adjustments. We accounted for the Wachovia merger under the purchase method 
of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of 
Wachovia at fair value. All PCI loans acquired in the merger were 
recorded at fair value based on the present value of their 
expected cash flows. We estimated cash flows using internal 
credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models using 
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We 
may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these 

merger carrying value of the credit-impaired loans and their 
expected cash flows Œ the ﬁnonaccretable differenceﬂ Œ is 
available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to 
increase our allowance for credit losses and related provision 
expense because of subsequent additional credit deterioration in 
these loans. For more information, refer to the ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) Loansﬂ and ﬁRisk 
Management Œ Credit Risk Managementﬂ sections in this 
Report. 121 €€ Risk Factors (continued) Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter, including as a result of changes in 
interest rates and the value of our MSRs and MHFS, 
and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming 
loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to 
fund new mortgage loans. We were the largest mortgage originator and residential mortgage servicer in the U.S. as of 
December€31,€2014, and we earn revenue from fees we receive 
for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. 
As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we€have a sizeable 
portfolio of MSRs. An MSR is the right to service a mortgage 
loan Œ collect principal, interest and escrow amounts Œ for a fee. 
We acquire MSRs when we keep the servicing rights after we sell 
or securitize the loans we have originated or when we purchase 
the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other 
lenders. We initially measure and carry all our residential MSRs 
using the fair value measurement method. Fair value is the 
present value of estimated future net servicing income, 
calculated based on a number of variables, including 
assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. 
Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions 
and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are 
usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing 
them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, 
the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we 
evaluate the fair value of our MSRs, and any decrease in fair 
value reduces earnings in the period in which the decrease 
occurs. We also measure at fair value MHFS for which an active 
secondary market and readily available market prices exist. In 
addition, we measure at fair value certain other interests we hold 
related to residential loan sales and securitizations. Similar to 
other interest-bearing securities, the value of these MHFS and 
other interests may be negatively affected by changes in interest 
rates. For example, if market interest rates increase relative to 
the yield on these MHFS and other interests, their fair value may 
fall. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan 
originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our 
MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates 
fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value 
of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting 
revenue effect. Even though they can act as a ﬁnatural hedge,ﬂ 
the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For 
example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the 
fair value of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any 
offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs 
relating to the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is 
also possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak 
or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to 
fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any 
increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset 
the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models 
and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may 
use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or 
Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or 
income being hedged. We could incur significant losses from our 
hedging activities. There may be periods where we elect not to 
use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage 
banking interest rate risk. We rely on GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on the Federal Housing 
Authority (FHA) to insure loans that meet their policy 
requirements. These loans are then securitized into either GSE 
or GNMA securities that are sold to investors. In order to meet 
customer needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to 
either GSE or FHA standards, which are referred to as 
ﬁnonconformingﬂ loans. We generally retain these 
nonconforming loans on our balance sheet. When we retain a 
loan on our balance sheet not only do we forgo fee revenue and 
keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not receive any 
sale proceeds that could be used to generate new loans. If we 
were unable or unwilling to continue retaining nonconforming 
loans on our balance sheet, whether due to regulatory, business 
or other reasons, our ability to originate new mortgage loans 
may be reduced, thereby reducing the fees we earn from 
originating and servicing loans. Similarly, if the GSEs or the FHA 
were to limit or reduce their purchases of loans, our ability to 
fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be 
reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or the FHA will not 
materially limit their purchases of conforming loans or change 
their criteria for what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., 
maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the 
GSEs is currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency acting as conservator. We 
cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorship will end, or 
any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and 
operations that could result. As noted above, there are various 
proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., 
including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. 
The impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing 
finance market and the GSEs, including whether the GSEs will 
continue to exist in their current form, as well as any effect on 
the Company™s business and financial results, are uncertain. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Asset/Liability Management Œ Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Riskﬂ and ﬁCritical Accounting Policiesﬂ sections in 
this Report. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches 
in contractual representations and warranties, and we 
may incur other losses as a result of real or alleged 
violations of statutes or regulations applicable to the 
origination of our residential mortgage loans. The origination of residential mortgage loans is governed by a variety 
of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Truth in 
Lending Act of 1968 and various anti-fraud and consumer 
protection statutes, which are complex and frequently changing. 
We often sell residential mortgage loans that we originate to 
various parties, including GSEs, SPEs that issue private label 
MBS, and other financial institutions that purchase mortgage 
loans for investment or private label securitization. We may also 
pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans which 
back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements under 
which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or guaranty 
agreements with the FHA and VA contain various 
representations and warranties regarding the origination and 
characteristics of the mortgage loans, including ownership of the 
loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable 
agreement, validity of the lien securing the loan, absence of 
delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, 
and compliance with applicable origination laws. We may be 
required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 122 € securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations 
or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 
90€days or less) after we receive notice of the breach. Contracts 
for mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of 
specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to 
inadequate responses to repurchase requests. Similarly, the 
agreements under which we sell mortgage loans require us to 
deliver various documents to the securitization trust or investor, 
and we may be obligated to repurchase any mortgage loan as to 
which the required documents are not delivered or are defective. 
We may negotiate global settlements in order to resolve a 
pipeline of demands in lieu of repurchasing the loans. We 
establish a mortgage repurchase liability related to the various 
representations and warranties that reflect management™s 
estimate of losses for loans which we have a repurchase 
obligation. Our mortgage repurchase liability represents 
management™s best estimate of the probable loss that we may 
expect to incur for the representations and warranties in the 
contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon 
economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external 
conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, 
the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is 
difficult to estimate and requires considerable management 
judgment. As a result of the uncertainty in the various estimates 
underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability 
that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of 
possible loss for representations and warranties does not 
represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available 
information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions 
that are subject to change. If economic conditions and the 
housing market do not continue to improve or future investor 
repurchase demand and our success at appealing repurchase 
requests differ from past experience, we could continue to have 
increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on 
repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase 
liability. Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we originate, borrowers may allege that the origination of the loans 
did not comply with applicable laws or regulations in one or 
more respects and assert such violation as an affirmative defense 
to payment or to the exercise by us of our remedies, including 
foreclosure proceedings, or in an action seeking statutory and 
other damages in connection with such violation. If we are not 
successful in demonstrating that the loans in dispute were 
originated in accordance with applicable statutes and 
regulations, we could become subject to monetary damages and 
other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual 
payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the 
loans. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Management Œ Liability for Mortgage Loan 
Repurchase Lossesﬂ section in this Report.€We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or 
reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage 
loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other 
sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, 

including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan 
foreclosure actions. We act as servicer and/or master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for 
unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain contractual 
obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or other third 
parties, including, in our capacity as a servicer, foreclosing on 
defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the 
applicable securitization or other investor agreement, 
considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan 
modifications or short sales and, in our capacity as a master 
servicer, overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the 
servicer. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as 
servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if 
the breach is not cured within a specified period of time 
following notice, which can generally be given by the 
securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security 
holders, causing us to lose servicing income. In addition, we may 
be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses 
from any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, to 
perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our 
part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross 
negligence. For certain investors and/or certain transactions, we 
may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or 
reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a 
remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have 
increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did 
not satisfy our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, or 
increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a 
significant reduction to net servicing income within mortgage 
banking noninterest income. We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity 
as a servicer in connection with pending or completed 
foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a 
foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to 
overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the 
foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/ 
or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the 
required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities 
may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly 
to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In 
addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action 
are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect 
or repurchase the loan. We may incur liability to securitization 
investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of 
mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply 
with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our MSRs 
may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs 
increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject 
to fines and other sanctions imposed by Federal or state 
regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our 
foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other 
mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our 
reputation or negatively affect our residential mortgage 
origination or servicing business. In particular, on February 28, 
2013, we entered into amendments to an April 2011 Consent 
Order with both the OCC and the FRB, which effectively ceased 
the Independent Foreclosure Review program created by such 
Consent Order and replaced it with an accelerated remediation 
commitment to provide foreclosure prevention actions on 
$1.2€billion of residential mortgage loans, subject to a process to 
be administered by the OCC and the FRB. During 2014, we 
believe we reported sufficient foreclosure prevention actions to 
the monitor of the accelerated remediation process to meet the 
$1.2 billion commitment, but are awaiting monitor approval. As 
noted above, any increase in our servicing costs from changes in 
our foreclosure and other servicing practices, including resulting 123 €€€Risk Factors (continued) from consent orders, negatively affects the fair value of our MSRs. In addition, on February 9, 2012, a federal/state settlement was announced among the DOJ, HUD, the Department of the 
Treasury, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Trade 
Commission, the Executive Office of the U.S. Trustee, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a task force of Attorneys 
General, Wells Fargo, and four other servicers related to 
investigations of mortgage industry servicing and foreclosure 
practices. Under the terms of this settlement, we agreed to 
certain programmatic commitments, consisting of three 
components totaling approximately $5.3 billion. As announced 
on March 18, 2014, we have successfully fulfilled our remaining 
commitments (and state-level sub-commitments) in accordance 
with the terms of this settlement. As part of the settlement, the Company was released from claims and allegations relating to servicing, modification and 
foreclosure practices; however, the settlement does not release 
the Company from any claims arising out of securitization 
activities, including representations made to investors respecting 
mortgage-backed securities; criminal claims; repurchase 
demands from the GSEs; and inquiries into MERS, among other 
items. Any investigations or litigation relating to any of the 
Company™s mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices that are 
not covered or released by the settlement could result in material 
fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other enforcement 
actions. For more information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ Credit Risk Management Œ Liability for Mortgage Loan 
Repurchase Lossesﬂ and ﬁŒ Risks Relating to Servicing 
Activities,ﬂ and ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ Valuation of

(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral) and Note 15 (Legal 
Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.€Financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may negatively affect our servicing 
and investment portfolios.€Our servicing portfolio includes certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from 
one or more mortgage insurance companies. To the extent that 
any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit 
downgrades, we may be required, as servicer of the insured loan 
on behalf of the investor, to obtain replacement coverage with 
another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we 
would replace. We may be responsible for some or all of the 
incremental cost of the new coverage for certain loans depending 
on the terms of our servicing agreement with the investor and 
other circumstances, although we do not have an additional risk 
of repurchase loss associated with claim amounts for loans sold 
to third-party investors. Similarly, some of the mortgage loans 
we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a 
mortgage insurer is unable to meet its credit obligations with 
respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if 
replacement coverage is not obtained. For example, in October 
2011, PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (PMI), one of our providers 
of mortgage insurance, was seized by its regulator. We 
previously utilized PMI to provide mortgage insurance on 
certain loans originated and held in our portfolio and on loans 
originated and sold to third-party investors. We also hold a small 
amount of residential MBS, which are backed by mortgages with 
a limited amount of insurance provided by PMI. PMI has 
announced that it will pay 50% of insurance claim amounts in 
cash with the rest deferred. Although we do not expect PMI™s 
situation to have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results because of the limited amount of loans and securities held in our portfolios with PMI insurance support, we cannot be 
certain that any such future events involving one of our other 
mortgage insurance company providers will not materially 
adversely affect our mortgage business and/or financial results. 
We also have investments in municipal bonds that are 
guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. The value of these 
bonds and the payment of principal and interest on them may be 
negatively affected by financial difficulties or credit downgrades 
experienced by the bond insurers. For more information, refer to the ﬁEarnings Performance Œ Balance Sheet Analysis Œ Investment Securitiesﬂ and ﬁRisk 
Management Œ Credit Risk ManagementŒ Liability for Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Lossesﬂ sections in this Report. OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK 
A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party 
vendors and other service providers, including as a 
result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, 
result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or 
proprietary information, damage our reputation, 
increase our costs and cause losses. As a large financial institution that serves over 70 million customers through over 
8,700 locations, 12,500 ATMs, the Internet and other 
distribution channels across the U.S. and internationally, we 
depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large 
number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our 
customer base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. 
and internationally, and as customer, public, legislative and 
regulatory expectations regarding operational and information 
security have increased, our operational systems and 
infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored 
for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, 
financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating 
systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become 
disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including 
events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For 
example, there could be sudden increases in customer 
transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; 
degradation or loss of public internet domain; climate change 
related impacts and natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising 
from local or larger scale political or social matters, including 
terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks. Although 
we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, 
our business operations may be adversely affected by significant 
and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or 
operating systems that support our businesses and customers. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in recent years in 
part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of 
the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct 
financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and 
activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and 
other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. 
Those parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce 
employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose 
confidential information in order to gain access to our data or 
that of our customers. As noted above, our operations rely on the 
secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential 
information in our computer systems and networks. Our 
banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and capital markets 
businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email 
systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. In 124 €addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PC™s, and other mobile devices 
that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we 
have robust information security procedures and controls, our 
technologies, systems, networks, and our customers™ devices may 
become the target of cyber attacks or information security 
breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo™s or our 
customers™ confidential, proprietary and other information, or 
otherwise disrupt Wells Fargo™s or its customers™ or other third 
parties™ business operations. For example, various retailers have 
reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large 
amounts of their customers™ data, including debit and credit card 
information, was obtained. In these situations we generally incur 
costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent 
transaction activity affecting our customers. Third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, 
financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or 
security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of 
operational and information security risk to us, including from 
breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity 
constraints. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but there 
can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the 
future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains 
heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature 
of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and 
its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to 
implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel 
strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions 
to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, 
our expanded geographic footprint and international presence, 
the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the 
current global economic and political environment. For example, 
Wells Fargo and other financial institutions continue to be the 
target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including 
malware and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the 
operations of financial institutions, potentially test their 
cybersecurity capabilities, or obtain confidential, proprietary or 
other information. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued 
development and enhancement of our controls, processes and 
systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software 
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a 
priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in 
industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, 
including our third-party service providers and governmental 
agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency 
to cybersecurity threats. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we 
may be required to expend significant additional resources to 
continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to 
investigate and remediate any information security 
vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or 
cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or 
devices that our customers use to access our products and 
services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the 
inability of our customers to transact business with us, violations 
of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties 
or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other 
compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of 
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
or financial condition. Our framework for managing risks may not be effective 
in mitigating risk and loss to us. Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have 
established processes and procedures intended to identify, 
measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which 
we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, 
interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or 
identified. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, 
monitor and predict risks, such as market and interest rate risks, 
however there is no assurance that these models will 
appropriately capture all relevant risks or accurately predict 
future events or exposures. In addition, we rely on data to 
aggregate and assess our various risk exposures and any issues 
with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and 
validation procedures could result in ineffective risk 
management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. The recent 
financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform 
highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of 
managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain 
focused on ensuring that financial institutions build and 
maintain robust risk management policies.€If our risk 
management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer 
unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. We may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even 
inadvertent or unintentional violations.€We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory 
frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for 
noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent 
or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time 
systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For 
example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial 
institutions from participating in the transfer of property 
belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and 
designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose 
penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if 
reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There 
may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of 
noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such 
a finding may also damage our reputation as described below 
and could restrict the ability of institutional investment 
managers to invest in our securities. Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, we are required to make certain disclosures in our 
periodic reports filed with the SEC relating to certain activities 
that we or our worldwide affiliates knowingly engaged in 
involving Iran during the quarterly period covered by the report. 
If we or an affiliate were to engage in a reportable transaction, 
we must also file a separate notice regarding the activity with the 
SEC, which the SEC will make publicly available on its website. 
The SEC will be required to forward the report to the President, 
the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs, and the House of Representatives 
Committees on Foreign Affairs and Financial Services. The 
President will then be required to initiate an investigation into 
the reported activity and within 180 days make a determination 
as to whether to impose sanctions on us. The scope of the 125 €€€ €€  €Risk Factors (continued) reporting requirement is broad and covers any domestic or foreign entity or person that may be deemed to be an affiliate of 
ours. The potential sanctions and reputational harm for 
engaging in a reportable activity may be significant. Negative publicity, including as a result of protests, could damage our reputation and business. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from 
negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has 
increased substantially because of the financial crisis and our 
size and profile in the financial services industry. The reputation 
of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as 
a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the 
financial services industry, and negative public opinion about 
the financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo 
specifically could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract 
customers. Negative public opinion could result from our actual 
or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including 
mortgage lending practices, servicing and foreclosure activities, 
corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and 
acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of 
customer information, and from actions taken by government 
regulators and community or other organizations in response to 
that conduct. Because we conduct most of our businesses under 
the ﬁWells Fargoﬂ brand, negative public opinion about one 
business could affect our other businesses and also could 
negatively affect our ﬁcross-sellﬂ strategy. The proliferation of 
social media websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third 
parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our team 
members and others, including personal blogs and social 
network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, 
inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or 
released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other 
negative consequences, including as a result of our team 
members interacting with our customers in an unauthorized 
manner in various social media outlets. As a result of the financial crisis, Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been targeted from time to time by 
protests and demonstrations, which have included disrupting 
the operation of our retail banking stores and have resulted in 
negative public commentary about financial institutions, 
including the fees charged for various products and services. 
There can be no assurance that continued protests and negative 
publicity for the Company or large financial institutions 
generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our 
business and financial results. Risks Relating to Legal Proceedings. Wells Fargo and some of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings or investigations concerning matters 
arising from our business activities. Although we believe we have 
a meritorious defense in all significant litigation pending against 
us, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. We 
establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated 
with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably 
estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we 
have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of 
resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any 
amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a 
pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and 
granted, could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition. For more information, refer to Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report.€RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY™S COMPETITIVE 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. We compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry 
that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial 
regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from 
the financial crisis and continued challenging economic 
conditions. Wells Fargo generally competes on the basis of the 
quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and 
services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those 
products and services to satisfy our customers™ needs, the pricing 
of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels 
available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. 
Continued and increased competition in any one or all of these 
areas may negatively affect our market share and results of 
operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in 
our businesses in order to remain competitive. Given the current 
economic, regulatory, and political environment for large 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and possible public 
backlash to bank fees, there is increased competitive pressure to 
provide products and services at current or lower prices. 
Consequently, our ability to reposition or reprice our products 
and services from time to time may be limited and could be 
influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who 
may or may not charge similar fees for their products and 
services. Any changes in the types of products and services that 
we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those products and 
services could result in a loss of customers and market share and 
could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Continued technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions 
to offer products and services that traditionally were banking 
products, and for financial institutions and other companies to 
provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, 
including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond 
effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new 
competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our 
business to modify or adapt our existing products and services or 
develop new products and services to respond to our customers™ 
needs. Our ﬁcross-sellingﬂ efforts to increase the number of 
products our customers buy from us and offer our 
customers all of the financial products that fulfill their 
needs is a key part of our growth strategy, and our 
failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a 
material adverse effect on our revenue growth and 
financial results. Selling more products to our customers Œ ﬁcross-sellingﬂ Œ is very important to our business model and key 
to our ability to grow revenue and earnings especially during the 
current environment of slow economic growth and regulatory 
reform initiatives. Many of our competitors also focus on cross-
selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. This 
can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or 
influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net 
interest income and revenue from our fee-based products. It 
could also affect our ability to keep existing customers. New 
technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt 
our products to attract and retain customers. Our cross-sell 
strategy also is dependent on earning more business from our 
Wachovia customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio Œ or the 
average number of products sold to existing customers Œ may 126 €€€€€€become more challenging and we might not attain our goal of selling an average of eight products to each customer. Our ability to attract and retain qualified team members is critical to the success of our business and 
failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
performance, competitive position and future 
prospects. The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our team members, and in many areas 
of our business, including the commercial banking, brokerage, 
investment advisory, and capital markets businesses, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. In order to 
attract and retain highly qualified team members, we must 
provide competitive compensation. As a large financial 
institution we may be subject to limitations on compensation by 
our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and 
retain these qualified team members. Some of our competitors 
may not be subject to these same compensation limitations, 
which may further negatively affect our ability to attract and 
retain highly qualified team members. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards 
are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how 
we report our financial results and condition.€Our accounting policies are fundamental to determining and 
understanding our financial results and condition. As described 
below, some of these policies require use of estimates and 
assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities 
and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies 
could materially affect our financial statements. From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the 
preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, 
accounting standard setters and those who interpret the 
accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking 
regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse 
their previous interpretations or positions on how these 
standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting 
and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations 
may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could 
materially affect how we report our financial results and 
condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised 
standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, 
also retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our 
restating prior period financial statements in material amounts. Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, could 
cause unexpected losses in the future, and our financial 
statements depend on our internal controls over 
financial reporting.€Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our 
financial statements, including in determining credit loss 
reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves related to 
litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, 
among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical 
because they require management to make difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about matters that are inherently 
uncertain and because it is likely that materially different 
amounts would be reported under different conditions or using 
different assumptions. For a description of these policies, refer 
to the ﬁCritical Accounting Policiesﬂ section in this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements 
are incorrect, we may experience material losses. Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, investment securities, certain loans, MSRs, 
private equity investments, structured notes and certain 
repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a 
determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial 
statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we 
may make fair value determinations based on internally 
developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some 
degree on management judgment, and there is no assurance that 
our models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant 
inputs required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these 
and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable 
price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being 
based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, 
sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain 
loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain 
balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such 
valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and 
could lead to declines in our earnings. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires our management to evaluate the Company™s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal 
control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in 
our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any ﬁmaterial 
weaknessesﬂ in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we 
will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end 
of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our 
stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. Sarbanes-Oxley 
also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors 
may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from 
us. If our auditors were found not to be ﬁindependentﬂ of us 
under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors 
and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. 
We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new 
financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our 
ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences. RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS 
Acquisitions could reduce our stock price upon announcement and reduce our earnings if we overpay 
or have difficulty integrating them.€We regularly explore opportunities to acquire companies in the financial services 
industry. We cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our 
acquisitions, and we typically do not comment publicly on a 
possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank, bank holding company or certain 
other financial services businesses depending on the size of the 
financial services business to be acquired. In deciding whether to 
approve a proposed acquisition, federal bank regulators will 
consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on 
competition and the risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or 
financial system, our financial condition and future prospects 
including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the 
competence, experience, and integrity of management and 127   
€€Risk Factors (continued) record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record 
of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and our 
effectiveness in combating money laundering. As a result of the 
Dodd-Frank Act and concerns regarding the large size of 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, the regulatory process 
for approving acquisitions has become more complex and 
regulatory approvals may be more difficult to obtain. We cannot 
be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any 
required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be 
required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets 
or issue additional equity as a condition to receiving regulatory 
approval for an acquisition. In addition, federal law prohibits 
regulatory approval of any transaction that would create an 
institution holding more than 10% of total U.S. insured deposits, 
or of any transaction (whether or not subject to prior approval) 
that would create a financial company with more than 10% of the 
liabilities of all financial companies in the U.S. As of 
September€30,€2014, we believe we already held more than 10% 
of total U.S. insured deposits. As a result, our size may limit our 
bank acquisition opportunities in the future. Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases 
in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits 
from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key team members, disruption 
of our business or the business of the acquired company, or 
otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and team 
members or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 
Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our 
ability to grow our existing businesses. Also, the negative effect 
of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in 
acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than 
expected. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the 
acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic 
location where we do not already have significant business 
operations and/or team members. *€*€* 
Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly 
reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2015 for material 
changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors 
not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could 
adversely affect our financial results and condition. 128 €€Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company™s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2014, of the Company™s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company™s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the 
Company™s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company™s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective as of December 31, 2014. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company™s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company™s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 
Ł pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; Ł provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and Ł provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company™s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during any quarter in 
2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company™s internal control over financial reporting. 
Managements™ report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth below and should be read with these limitations in mind. Management™s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company™s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the 
Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company™s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, 
using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (1992). Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2014, the Company™s internal control over financial reporting was effective. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company™s financial statements included in this Annual Report, issued an audit report on the Company™s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG™s audit report appears on the 
following page. 129 €€€
€€€€€€
€Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Wells€Fargo & Company: We have audited Wells€Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries™ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December€31,€2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Œ Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company™s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included 
in the accompanying Management™s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company™s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over 
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in 
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company™s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December€31,€2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Œ Integrated Framework (1992) issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and 
our report dated February€25,€2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. San Francisco, California

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Wells€Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services company. We provide banking, insurance, trust and 
investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail 
banking, brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance 
through banking stores, the internet and other distribution 
channels to consumers, businesses and institutions in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and in foreign countries. When 
we refer to ﬁWells€Fargo,ﬂ ﬁthe Company,ﬂ ﬁwe,ﬂ ﬁourﬂ or ﬁus,ﬂ we 
mean Wells€Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). 
Wells€Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding 
company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority 
interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly 
traded preferred stock outstanding. Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices 
in the financial services industry. To prepare the financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make 
estimates based on assumptions about future economic and 
market conditions (for example, unemployment, market 
liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
income and expenses during the reporting period and the related 
disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current 
conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is 
reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than 
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our 
results of operations and financial condition. Management has 
made significant estimates in several areas, including allowance 
for credit losses and purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans 
(Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses)), valuations of 
residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities)) and financial instruments 
(Note€17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities)) and income taxes 
(Note 21 (Income Taxes)). Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. Accounting for Certain Factored Loan Receivable Arrangements The Company determined that certain factoring arrangements 
previously included within commercial loans, which were 
recorded with a corresponding obligation in other liabilities, did 
not qualify as loan purchases under Accounting Standard 
Codification (ASC) Topic 860 (Transfers and Servicing of 
Financial Assets) based on interpretations of the specific 
arrangements.€Accordingly, we revised our commercial loan 
balances for year-end 2012 and each of the quarters in 2013 in 
order to present the Company™s lending trends on a comparable 
basis over this period.€This revision, which resulted in a 
reduction to total commercial loans and a corresponding 
decrease to other liabilities, did not impact the Company™s 
consolidated net income or total cash flows.€We reduced our 
commercial loans by $3.5 billion, $3.2 billion, $2.1 billion, 

$1.6€billion, and $1.2 billion at December 31, September 30, 

June 30 and March 31, 2013, and December 31, 2012, 
respectively, which represented less than 1% of total commercial 

loans and less than 0.5% of our total loan portfolio. We also 

appropriately revised other affected financial information, 
including financial guarantees and financial ratios, to reflect this 
revision. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2014 
In 2014, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: 
Ł Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting; Ł ASU 2014-14, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain 
Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans Upon 
Foreclosure; Ł ASU 2014-04, Receivables -Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of 
Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage 
Loans upon Foreclosure; Ł ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss 
Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit 
Carryforward Exists; and Ł ASU 2013-08, Financial Services - Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and 
Disclosure Requirements. ASU 2014-17 provides an acquired entity with the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements. 
We adopted the guidance in fourth quarter 2014 with 
prospective application. This Update did not have a material 
effect on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2014-14 requires certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans to be classified as other receivables upon foreclosure and measured based on the loan balance expected to 
be recovered from the guarantor. We early adopted this guidance 
in fourth quarter 2014, effective as of January 1, 2014, through a 
modified retrospective transition. Our adoption of this Update 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial 
statements. See Note 7 (Premises, Equipment, Lease 
Commitments and Other Assets). ASU 2014-04 clarifies the timing of when a creditor has taken physical possession of residential real estate collateral for a consumer mortgage loan, resulting in the reclassification of the 
loan receivable to real estate owned. The guidance also requires 
disclosure of the amount of foreclosed residential real estate 
property held by the creditor and the recorded investment in 
residential real estate mortgage loans that are in process of 
foreclosure. We adopted this guidance in first quarter 2014. This 
Update did not have a material effect on our consolidated 
financial statements as this guidance was consistent with our 
prior practice. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit 
Losses). ASU 2013-11 provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating 
loss (NOL) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit 
carryforward exists. We adopted this guidance in first quarter 
2014 with prospective application to all existing unrecognized 
tax benefits at the effective date. This Update did not have a 
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2013-08 changes the criteria companies use to assess whether an entity is an investment company and requires new disclosures for investment companies. We adopted this guidance 139 €€€ €Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) in first quarter 2014. This Update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.€Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
the Parent and our majority-owned subsidiaries and variable 
interest entities (VIEs) (defined below) in which we are the 
primary beneficiary. Significant intercompany accounts and 
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When we have 
significant influence over operating and financing decisions for a 
company but do not own a majority of the voting equity 
interests, we account for the investment using the equity method 
of accounting, which requires us to recognize our proportionate 
share of the company™s earnings. If we do not have significant 
influence, we recognize the equity investment at cost except for 
(1) marketable equity securities, which we recognize at fair value 
with changes in fair value included in OCI, and (2) 
nonmarketable equity investments for which we have elected the 
fair value option. Investments accounted for under the equity or 
cost method are included in Other Assets. We are a variable interest holder in certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling 
financial interest or where the entity does not have enough 
equity at risk to finance its activities without additional 
subordinated financial support from other parties (referred to as 
VIEs). Our variable interest arises from contractual, ownership 
or other monetary interests in the entity, which change with 
fluctuations in the fair value of the entity's net assets. We 
consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, defined as 
the party that has both the power to direct the activities that 
most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that 
potentially could be significant to the VIE. To determine whether 
or not a variable interest we hold could potentially be significant 
to the VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors 
regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the 
VIE. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of 
a VIE on an ongoing basis. Cash and Due From Banks Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in 
transit, and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank and 
other depository institutions. Trading Assets Trading assets are predominantly securities, including corporate 
debt, U.S. government agency obligations and other securities 
that we acquire for short-term appreciation or other trading 
purposes, certain loans held for market-making purposes to 
support the buying and selling demands of our customers 
and derivatives primarily held for customer accommodation 
purposes or risk mitigation and hedging. Interest-only strips and 
other retained interests in securitizations that can be 
contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that the 
holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded 
investment are classified as trading assets. Trading assets are 
carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in 
earnings. For securities and loans in trading assets, interest and 
dividend income are recorded in interest income, and realized 
and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income. 
For other trading assets, including derivatives, the entire change 
in fair value is recorded in noninterest income. Investments 
Our investments include various debt and marketable equity 
securities and nonmarketable equity investments. We classify 
debt and marketable equity securities as available-for-sale or 
held-to-maturity securities based on our intent to hold to 
maturity. Our nonmarketable equity investments are reported in 
Other Assets. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES Debt securities that we might not hold until maturity and marketable equity securities 
are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair 
value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable income taxes, 
are reported in cumulative OCI. We conduct other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) analysis on a quarterly basis or more often if a potential loss-
triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of OTTI for both 
debt and equity securities is a decline in fair value below the 
amount recorded for an investment and the severity and 
duration of the decline. For a debt security for which there has been a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we 
(1) have the intent to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than 
not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of 
its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the 
entire amortized cost basis of the security. Estimating recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based upon an assessment of the cash flows expected 
to be collected. If the present value of cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the security™s effective yield, is less than 
amortized cost, OTTI is considered to have occurred. In 
performing an assessment of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, we consider all relevant information including: 
Ł the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has 
been less than the amortized cost basis; Ł the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the 
security; Ł the cause of the price decline, such as the general level of 
interest rates or adverse conditions specifically related to 
the security, an industry or a geographic area; Ł the issuer's financial condition, near-term prospects and 
ability to service the debt; Ł the payment structure of the debt security and the 
likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that 
increase in the future; Ł for asset-backed securities, the credit performance of the 
underlying collateral, including delinquency rates, level of 
non-performing assets, cumulative losses to date, collateral 
value and the remaining credit enhancement compared with 
expected credit losses; Ł any change in rating agencies' credit ratings at evaluation 
date from acquisition date and any likely imminent action; Ł independent analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit 
ratings and other independent market data; and Ł recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to 
the balance sheet date. If we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery, an OTTI write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the entire 
difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the 

temporarily impaired that we do not intend to sell or it is more 
likely than not that we will not be required to sell before 
recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount 
representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and 140 €  €€€the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in OCI. The measurement of the credit loss component is equal to 
the difference between the debt security's amortized cost basis 
and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
discounted at the security's effective yield. The remaining 
difference between the security™s fair value and the present value 
of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit-
related and, therefore, is recognized in OCI. We believe that we 
will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which we have 
recorded a non-credit-related impairment in OCI. We hold investments in perpetual preferred securities (PPS) that are structured in equity form, but have many of the 
characteristics of debt instruments, including periodic cash flows 
in the form of dividends, call features, ratings that are similar to 
debt securities and pricing like long-term callable bonds. Because of the hybrid nature of these securities, we evaluate PPS for OTTI using a model similar to the model we use for debt 
securities as described above. Among the factors we consider in 
our evaluation of PPS are whether there is any evidence of 
deterioration in the credit of the issuer as indicated by a decline 
in cash flows or a rating agency downgrade to below investment 
grade and the estimated recovery period. Additionally, in 
determining if there was evidence of credit deterioration, we 
evaluate: (1) the severity of decline in market value below cost, 
(2) the period of time for which the decline in fair value has 
existed, and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects 
of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence 

temporarily impaired if cash flows expected to be collected are 
insufficient to recover our investment or if we no longer believe 
the security will recover within the estimated recovery period. 
OTTI write-downs of PPS are recognized in earnings equal to the 
difference between the cost basis and fair value of the security. 
Based upon the factors considered in our OTTI evaluation, we 
believe our investments in PPS currently rated investment grade 
will be fully realized and, accordingly, have not recognized OTTI 
on such securities. For marketable equity securities other than PPS, OTTI evaluations focus on whether evidence exists that supports 
recovery of the unrealized loss within a timeframe consistent 
with temporary impairment. This evaluation considers the 
severity of and length of time fair value is below cost, our intent 
and ability to hold the security until forecasted recovery of the 
fair value of the security, and the investee's financial condition, 
capital strength, and near-term prospects. We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of investment securities in noninterest income using the specific 
identification method. Unamortized premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the 
interest method. As principal repayments are received on 
securities (i.e., primarily mortgage-backed securities (MBS)) a 
proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is 
recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the 
remaining portion of the security continues unchanged. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES Debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to 
maturity are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization 
of premiums and accretion of discounts. We recognize OTTI 
when there is a decline in fair value and we do not expect to 
recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. The 
amortized cost is written-down to fair value with the credit loss 
component recorded to earnings and the remaining component 
recognized in OCI. The OTTI assessment related to whether we expect recovery of the amortized cost basis and determination of 

maturity securities is the same as described for available-for-sale 
securities. Security transfers to the held-to-maturity 
classification are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains or 
losses from the transfer of available-for-sale securities continue 
to be reported in cumulative OCI and are amortized into 
earnings over the remaining life of the security using the 
effective interest method. NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS Nonmarketable equity investments include low income housing tax credit 
investments, equity securities that are not publicly traded and 
securities acquired for various purposes, such as to meet 
regulatory requirements (for example, Federal Reserve Bank and 
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock). We have elected the 
fair value option for some of these investments with the 
remainder of these investments accounted for under the cost or 
equity method, which we review at least quarterly for possible 
OTTI. Our review typically includes an analysis of the facts and 
circumstances of each investment, the expectations for the 
investment's cash flows and capital needs, the viability of its 
business model and our exit strategy. We reduce the asset value 
when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary. 
We recognize the estimated loss as a loss from equity 
investments in noninterest income.€Securities Purchased and Sold Agreements Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold 
under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized 
financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale 
price plus accrued interest. We monitor the fair value of 
securities purchased and sold, and obtain collateral from or 
return it to counterparties when appropriate. These financing 
transactions do not create material credit risk given the 
collateral provided and the related monitoring process. Mortgages and Loans Held for Sale Mortgages held for sale (MHFS) include commercial and 
residential mortgages originated for sale and securitization in 
the secondary market, which is our principal market, or for sale 
as whole loans. We elect the fair value option for substantially all 
residential MHFS (see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities)). The remaining residential MHFS are held at the 
lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM), and are valued on an 
aggregate portfolio basis. Commercial MHFS are held at LOCOM 
and are valued on an individual loan basis. Loans held for sale (LHFS) are carried at LOCOM. Generally, consumer loans are valued on an aggregate portfolio 
basis, and commercial loans are valued on an individual loan 
basis. Gains and losses on MHFS are recorded in mortgage banking noninterest income. Gains and losses on LHFS are 
recorded in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination 
costs and fees for MHFS and LHFS under the fair value option 
are recognized in income at origination. For MHFS and LHFS 
recorded at LOCOM, loan costs and fees are deferred at 
origination and are recognized in income at time of sale. Interest 
income on MHFS and LHFS is calculated based upon the note 
rate of the loan and is recorded to interest income. investment loans that meet or exceed established loan product 
profitability criteria, including minimum positive net interest 
margin spreads in excess of funding costs. When a 
determination is made at the time of commitment to originate 141 €€€€€Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the ﬁforeseeable future,ﬂ subject to periodic 
review under our management evaluation processes, including 
corporate asset/liability management. In determining the 
ﬁforeseeable futureﬂ for loans, management considers (1) the 
current economic environment and market conditions, (2) our 
business strategy and current business plans, (3) the nature and 
type of the loan receivable, including its expected life, and (4) 
our current financial condition and liquidity demands. If 
subsequent changes, including changes in interest rates 
significantly impact the ongoing profitability of certain loan 
products, we may subsequently change our intent to hold these 
loans, and we would take actions to sell such loans. Upon such 
management determination, we immediately transfer these 
loans to the MHFS or LHFS portfolio at LOCOM. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of 
any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized 
deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized 
premiums or discounts on purchased loans. PCI loans are 
reported net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments. 
See the ﬁPurchased Credit-Impaired Loansﬂ section in this Note 
for our accounting policy for PCI loans. Unearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income over the 
contractual life of the loan using the interest method. Loan 
commitment fees are generally deferred and amortized into 
noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the commitment 
period. We have private label and co-brand credit card loans through a program agreement that involves our active 
participation in the operating activity of the program with a third 
party. We share in the economic results of the loans subject to 
this agreement. We consider the program to be a collaborative 
arrangement and therefore report our share of revenue and 
losses on a net basis in interest income for loans, other 
noninterest income and provision for credit losses as applicable. 
Our net share of revenue from this activity represented less than 
1% of our total revenues for 2014. Loans also include direct financing leases that are recorded at the aggregate of minimum lease payments receivable plus the 
estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned 
income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of direct financing 
leases, are recorded net of related non-recourse debt. Leasing 
income is recognized as a constant percentage of outstanding 
lease financing balances over the lease terms in interest income. NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
Ł the full and timely collection of interest or principal 
becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower™s financial condition and the adequacy of 
collateral, if any); Ł they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 

family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest 
or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of 
collection; Ł part of the principal balance has been charged off (including 
loans discharged in bankruptcy); Ł for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 

process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status; or Ł performing consumer loans are discharged in bankruptcy, 
regardless of their delinquency status. PCI loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, such loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though 
they may be contractually past due because we expect to fully 
collect the new carrying values of such loans (that is, the new 
cost basis arising out of purchase accounting). When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and 
amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. If the 
ultimate collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on 
a nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash 
collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan. 
Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent cash 
is received. Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all 
delinquent interest and principal become current under the 
terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining 
principal and interest is no longer doubtful. For modified loans, we re-underwrite at the time of a restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of 
sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower™s financial 
strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios 
and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated 
performance under the previous terms and the underwriting 
process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the 
restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing 
status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan 
either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will 
return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a 
sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive 
months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive 
payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed 
on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded 
if we believe it is probable that principal and interest 
contractually due under the modified terms of the agreement 
will not be collectible. Our loans are considered past due when contractually required principal or interest payments have not been made on 
the due dates. LOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES For commercial loans, we generally fully charge off or charge down to net realizable value 
(fair value of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for loans 
secured by collateral when: 
Ł management judges the loan to be uncollectible; Ł repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable 
time frames; Ł the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal 
loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; Ł the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes 
evident owing to a lack of assets; or Ł the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and 

in the process of collection. For consumer loans, we fully charge off or charge down to net realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcy discharge or other factors, or no later than reaching 
a defined number of days past due, as follows: 
Ł 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages Œ We generally 
charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 180 

days past due. 142 €€€  €Ł Auto loans Œ We generally fully charge off when the loan is 120 days past due. Ł Credit card loans Œ We generally fully charge off when the 
loan is 180 days past due. 
Ł Unsecured loans (closed end) Œ We generally fully charge 
off when the loan is 120 days past due. 
Ł Unsecured loans (open end) Œ We generally fully charge off 
when the loan is 180 days past due. 
Ł Other secured loans Œ We generally fully or partially charge 
down to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past 

due. IMPAIRED LOANS We consider a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, we determine that we 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan 
contract, including scheduled interest payments. This evaluation 
is generally based on delinquency information, an assessment of 
the borrower™s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any. Our impaired loans predominantly include loans on 
nonaccrual status for commercial and industrial, commercial 
real estate (CRE) and any loans modified in a TDR, on both 
accrual and nonaccrual status. When we identify a loan as impaired, we generally measure the impairment, if any, based on the difference between the 
recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, 
deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or 
discount) and the present value of expected future cash flows, 
discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate. When the value of 
an impaired loan is calculated by discounting expected cash 
flows, interest income is recognized using the loan™s effective 
interest rate over the remaining life of the loan. When collateral 
is the sole source of repayment for the impaired loan, rather 
than the borrower™s income or other sources of repayment, we 
charge down to net realizable value. TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS In situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower™s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant 
period of time to the borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. These modified 
terms may include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term 
extensions, payment forbearance and other actions intended to 
minimize our economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or 
repossession of the collateral. For modifications where we 
forgive principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness 
is immediately charged off. Loans classified as TDRs, including 
loans in trial payment periods (trial modifications), are 
considered impaired loans. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held-for-sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if 
they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and 
qualify as a new loan. PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED LOANS Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and where 
it is probable that we will not collect all contractually required 
principal and interest payments are PCI loans. PCI loans are 
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the 
historical allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not 
carried over. Some loans that otherwise meet the definition as 
credit-impaired are specifically excluded from the PCI loan 
portfolios, such as revolving loans where the borrower still has 
revolving privileges. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, commercial risk ratings, recent borrower credit scores 
and recent loan-to-value percentages. Generally, acquired loans 
that meet our definition for nonaccrual status are considered to 
be credit-impaired. Substantially all commercial PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, consumer PCI loans have been 
aggregated into pools based on common risk characteristics. 
Each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single 
composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash 
flows. Accounting for PCI loans involves estimating fair value, at acquisition, using the principal and interest cash flows expected 
to be collected discounted at the prevailing market rate of 
interest. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over 
the carrying value (estimated fair value at acquisition date) is 
referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest 
income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of 
the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a 
reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash 
flows to be collected. The difference between contractually 
required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at 
acquisition, considering the impact of prepayments, is referred 
to as the nonaccretable difference. Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. If we have 
probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected (other 
than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes in 
prepayment assumptions), we charge the provision for credit 
losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. If 
we have probable and significant increases in cash flows 
expected to be collected, we first reverse any previously 
established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest 
income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life 
of the loan, or pool of loans. Estimates of cash flows are 
impacted by changes in interest rate indices for variable rate 
loans and prepayment assumptions, both of which are treated as 
prospective yield adjustments included in interest income. Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or 
foreclosure of the collateral. For individual PCI loans, gains or 
losses on sales to third parties are included in noninterest 
income, and gains or losses as a result of a settlement with the 
borrower are included in interest income. Our policy is to 
remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the 
amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. 
Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the 
nonaccretable difference for the entire pool. This removal 
method assumes that the amount received from resolution 
approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining 
accretable yield balance is unaffected and any material change in 
remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is 
addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each 
pool. For loans that are resolved by payment in full, there is no 
release of the nonaccretable difference for the pool because there 
is no difference between the amount received at resolution and 
the contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not 
removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be 
deemed TDRs. Modified PCI loans that are accounted for 
individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI 
accounting if there has been a concession granted in excess of 
the original nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in 
our impaired loans. FORECLOSED ASSETS Foreclosed€assets obtained through our lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans 143 €€ € €€Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) have been written down to their net realizable value prior to foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is 
recorded with a charge to the allowance for credit losses at 
foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize 
determination of net realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net 
realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net 
realizable value of these assets is reviewed and updated 
periodically depending on the type of property. See the 
discussion earlier in this Note about classification changes for 
certain government-guaranteed loan foreclosures that resulted 
from our adoption of ASU 2014-14 this year. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ACL) The allowance for credit losses is management™s estimate of credit losses inherent 
in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at 
the balance sheet date. We have an established process to 
determine the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses 
that assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio and related 
unfunded credit commitments. We develop and document our 
allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level -
commercial loan portfolio and consumer loan portfolio. While 
we attribute portions of the allowance to our respective 
commercial and consumer portfolio segments, the entire 
allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total 
loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. Our process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer 
loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are 
estimated collectively for groups of loans with similar 
characteristics, individually or pooled for impaired loans or, for 
PCI loans, based on the changes in cash flows expected to be 
collected. Our allowance levels are influenced by loan volumes, loan grade migration or delinquency status, historic loss experience 
and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as 
economic conditions. COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY Generally, commercial loans are assessed for estimated losses by 
grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through 
periodic reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial 
portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in 
accordance with the borrower™s financial strength, and the 
severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of 
any underlying collateral. Probability of default and severity at 
the time of default are statistically derived through historical 
observations of default and losses after default within each credit 
risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on 
additional analysis of long-term average loss experience 
compared to previously forecasted losses, external loss data or 
other risks identified from current economic conditions and 
credit quality trends. The estimated probability of default and 
severity at the time of default are applied to loan equivalent 
exposures to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance also includes an amount for the estimated impairment on nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial 
loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For consumer loans that are not identified as a TDR, we 
determine the allowance predominantly on a collective basis 
utilizing forecasted losses to represent our best estimate of 
inherent loss. We pool loans, generally by product types with 
similar risk characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages and credit cards. As appropriate and to achieve 
greater accuracy, we may further stratify selected portfolios by 
sub-product, origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic 
location and other predictive characteristics. Models designed 
for each pool are utilized to develop the loss estimates. We use 
assumptions for these pools in our forecast models, such as 
historic delinquency and default, loss severity, home price 
trends, unemployment trends, and other key economic variables 
that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the 
pool. In determining the appropriate allowance attributable to our residential mortgage portfolio, we take into consideration 
portfolios determined to be at elevated risk, such as junior lien 
mortgages behind delinquent first lien mortgages and junior lien 
lines of credit subject to near term significant payment increases. 
We incorporate the default rates and high severity of loss for 
these higher risk portfolios, including the impact of our 
established loan modification programs. When modifications 
occur or are probable to occur, our allowance considers the 
impact of these modifications, taking into consideration the 
associated credit cost, including re-defaults of modified loans 
and projected loss severity. Accordingly, the loss content 
associated with the effects of existing and probable loan 
modifications and higher risk portfolios has been captured in our 
allowance methodology. We separately estimate impairment for consumer loans that have been modified in a TDR (including trial modifications), 
whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. OTHER ACL MATTERS The allowance for credit losses for both portfolio segments includes an amount for imprecision or 
uncertainty that may change from period to period. This amount 
represents management™s judgment of risks inherent in the 
processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. 
This imprecision considers economic environmental factors, 
modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other 
subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk 
assessments. Securitizations and Beneficial Interests In certain asset securitization transactions that meet the 
applicable criteria to be accounted for as a sale, assets are sold to 
an entity referred to as an SPE, which then issues beneficial 
interests in the form of senior and subordinated interests 
collateralized by the assets. In some cases, we may retain 
beneficial interests issued by the entity. Additionally, from time 
to time, we may also re-securitize certain assets in a new 
securitization transaction. The assets and liabilities transferred to an SPE are excluded from our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies as a 
sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. For transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained 
(including beneficial interests) and liabilities incurred. We 
record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference 
between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
sold. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, quoted 
market prices for similar assets, or if market prices are not 
available, then the fair value is estimated using discounted cash 
flow analyses with assumptions for credit losses, prepayments 
and discount rates that are corroborated by and verified against 
market observable data, where possible. Retained interests and 
liabilities incurred from securitizations with off-balance sheet 
entities, including SPEs and VIEs, where we are not the primary 
beneficiary, are classified as investment securities, trading 144 €€€€€€account assets, loans, MSRs or other liabilities (including liabilities for mortgage repurchase losses) and are accounted for 
as described herein. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) We recognize the rights to service mortgage loans for others, or 
MSRs, as assets whether we purchase the MSRs or the MSRs 
result from a sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset 
transfers). We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. 
Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. All 
of our MSRs related to our commercial mortgage loans are 
subsequently measured at LOCOM. The valuation and sensitivity 
of MSRs is discussed further in Note 8 (Securitizations and 
Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) 
and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities). For MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are reported in noninterest income in the period in which the 
change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at LOCOM are 
amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net 
servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is reported in 
noninterest income, analyzed monthly and adjusted to reflect 
changes in prepayment speeds, as well as other factors. MSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For 
purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we 
stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of 
the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by 
individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds 
fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation 
reserve is adjusted as the fair value changes. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and amortization. Capital leases, where we are the 
lessee, are included in premises and equipment at the capitalized 
amount less accumulated amortization. We primarily use the straight-line method of depreciation and amortization. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for 

buildings, up to 10 years for furniture and equipment, and the 

shorter of the estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease 

term for leasehold improvements. We amortize capitalized 
leased assets on a straight-line basis over the lives of the 
respective leases. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded in business combinations under the 
purchase method of accounting when the purchase price is 
higher than the fair value of net assets, including identifiable 
intangible assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. 
We have determined that our reporting units are one level below 
the operating segments. We have the option of performing a 
qualitative assessment of goodwill. We may also elect to bypass 
the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. 
We initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test 
for impairment. If, based on our qualitative review, we conclude 
that more likely than not a reporting unit™s fair value is less than 
its carrying amount, then we complete quantitative steps as 
described below to determine if there is goodwill impairment. If 
we conclude that a reporting unit™s fair value is not less than its 
carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. We assess 
goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level and apply 
various quantitative valuation methodologies when required to 
compare the estimated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. Valuation methodologies include discounted cash 
flow and earnings multiple approaches. If the fair value is less 
than the carrying amount, an additional test is required to 
measure the amount of impairment. We recognize impairment 
losses as a charge to noninterest expense (unless related to 
discontinued operations) and an adjustment to the carrying 
value of the goodwill asset. Subsequent reversals of goodwill 
impairment are prohibited. We amortize core deposit and other customer relationship intangibles on an accelerated basis over useful lives not 
exceeding 10 years. We review such intangibles for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is 
indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash 
flows is less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is 
permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent 
that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Operating Lease Assets Operating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized in 
other income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Related 
depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life, considering the estimated residual value of 
the leased asset. The useful life may be adjusted to the term of 
the lease depending on our plans for the asset after the lease 
term. On a periodic basis, leased assets are reviewed for 
impairment. Impairment loss is recognized if the carrying 
amount of leased assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. 
The carrying amount of leased assets is not recoverable if it 
exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to 
result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value 
upon the eventual disposition of the equipment. Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 
mortgage loans to various parties, we establish a mortgage 
repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to various 
representations and warranties that reflect management™s 
estimate of losses for loans for which we could have a repurchase 
obligation, whether or not we currently service those loans, 
based on a combination of factors. Such factors include default 
expectations, expected investor repurchase demands (influenced 
by current and expected mortgage loan file requests and 
mortgage insurance rescission notices, as well as estimated 
levels of origination defects) and appeals success rates (where 
the investor rescinds the demand based on a cure of the defect or 
acknowledges that the loan satisfies the investor™s applicable 
representations and warranties), reimbursement by 
correspondent and other third party originators, and projected 
loss severity. We continually update our mortgage repurchase 
liability estimate during the life of the loans. The liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is included in other liabilities. For additional information on our repurchase 
liability, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities). Pension Accounting We account for our defined benefit pension plans using an 
actuarial model.€Two principal assumptions in determining net 
periodic pension cost are the discount rate and the expected long 
term rate of return on plan assets. A discount rate is used to estimate the present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We use a consistent 
methodology to determine the discount rate based upon the 
yields on multiple portfolios of bonds with maturity dates that 
closely match the estimated timing and amounts of the expected 145 €€€€€  Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) benefit payments for our plans. Such portfolios are derived from a broad-based universe of high quality corporate bonds as of the 
measurement date. Our determination of the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is highly quantitative by 
nature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected 
returns under two sets of conditions: projected returns using 
several forward-looking capital market assumptions, and 
historical returns for the main asset classes dating back to 1970 
or the earliest period for which historical data was readily 
available for the asset classes included. Using long term 
historical data allows us to capture multiple economic 
environments, which we believe is relevant when using historical 
returns. We place greater emphasis on the forward-looking 
return and risk assumptions than on historical results. We use 
the resulting projections to derive a base line expected rate of 
return and risk level for the Cash Balance Plan™s prescribed asset 
mix. We evaluate the portfolio based on: (1) the established 
target asset allocations over short term (one-year) and longer 

term (ten-year) investment horizons, and (2) the range of 

potential outcomes over these horizons within specific standard 
deviations. We perform the above analyses to assess the 
reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets. We consider the expected rate of return to be a long-term 
average view of expected returns. The use of an expected long 
term rate of return on plan assets may cause us to recognize 
pension income returns that are greater or less than the actual 
returns of plan assets in any given year. Differences between 
expected and actual returns in each year, if any, are included in 
our net actuarial gain or loss amount, which is recognized in 
OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of 
a 5% corridor from accumulated OCI into net periodic pension 

cost over the estimated average remaining participation period, 
which at December€31, 2014, is 21 years. See Note 20 (Employee 

Benefits and Other Expenses) for additional information on our 
pension accounting. Income Taxes We file consolidated and separate company federal income tax 
returns, foreign tax returns and various combined and separate 
company state tax returns. We evaluate two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents our 
estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and 
includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax 
positions. We determine deferred income taxes using the 
balance sheet method. Under this method, the net deferred tax 
asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences 
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and 
recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in 
which they occur. Deferred income tax expense results from 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's 
judgment that realization is ﬁmore likely than not.ﬂ Uncertain tax 
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition 
threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to 
recognize.€An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest 
amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 
50% likelihood of realization upon settlement.€Tax benefits not 
meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax 
benefits. Foreign taxes paid are generally applied as credits to 
reduce federal income taxes payable. We account for interest and 
penalties as a component of income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation 
We have stock-based employee compensation plans as more 
fully discussed in Note 19 (Common Stock and Stock Plan). Our 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan provides for awards of 
incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation 
rights, restricted shares, restricted share rights (RSRs), 
performance share awards (PSAs) and stock awards without 
restrictions. For most awards, we measure the cost of employee 
services received in exchange for an award of equity 
instruments, such as stock options, RSRs or PSAs, based on the 
fair value of the award on the grant date. The cost is normally 
recognized in our income statement over the vesting period of 
the award; awards with graded vesting are expensed on a 
straight line method. Awards that continue to vest after 
retirement are expensed over the shorter of the period of time 
between the grant date and the final vesting period or between 
the grant date and when a team member becomes retirement 
eligible; awards to team members who are retirement eligible at 
the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant. Beginning in 2013, certain RSRs and all PSAs granted include discretionary performance based vesting conditions and 
are subject to variable accounting. For these awards, the 
associated compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our 
stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also fluctuates 
based on the estimated outcome of meeting the performance 
conditions.€Earnings Per Common Share We compute earnings per common share by dividing net income 
(after deducting dividends on preferred stock) by the average 
number of common shares outstanding during the year. We 
compute diluted earnings per common share by dividing net 
income (after deducting dividends and related accretion on 
preferred stock) by the average number of common shares 
outstanding during the year, plus the effect of common stock 
equivalents (for example, stock options, restricted share rights, 
convertible debentures and warrants) that are dilutive. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We use fair value measurements in our fair value disclosures and 
to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring 
basis, such as trading assets, or on a nonrecurring basis such as 
measuring impairment on assets carried at amortized cost. DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. These fair value 
measurements are based on exit prices and determined by 
maximizing the use of observable inputs. However, for certain 
instruments we must utilize unobservable inputs in determining 
fair value due to the lack of observable inputs in the market, 
which requires greater judgment in measuring fair value. In instances where there is limited or no observable market data, fair value measurements for assets and liabilities are based 
primarily upon our own estimates or combination of our own 
estimates and third-party vendor or broker pricing, and the 
measurements are often calculated based on current pricing for 
products we offer or issue, the economic and competitive 
environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and 
other such factors. As with any valuation technique used to 
estimate fair value, changes in underlying assumptions used, 
including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, 
could significantly affect the results of current or future values. 146 Accordingly, these fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. We incorporate lack of liquidity into our fair value measurement based on the type of asset or liability measured 
and the valuation methodology used. For example, for certain 
residential MHFS and certain securities where the significant 
inputs have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and 
vendor or broker pricing is not used, we use a discounted cash 
flow technique to measure fair value. This technique 
incorporates forecasting of expected cash flows (adjusted for 
credit loss assumptions and estimated prepayment speeds) 
discounted at an appropriate market discount rate to reflect the 
lack of liquidity in the market that a market participant would 
consider. For other securities where vendor or broker pricing is 
used, we use either unadjusted broker quotes or vendor prices or 
vendor or broker prices adjusted by weighting them with 
internal discounted cash flow techniques to measure fair value. 
These unadjusted vendor or broker prices inherently reflect any 
lack of liquidity in the market, as the fair value measurement 
represents an exit price from a market participant viewpoint. Where markets are inactive and transactions are not orderly, transaction or quoted prices for assets or liabilities in 
inactive markets may require adjustment due to the uncertainty 
of whether the underlying transactions are orderly. For items 
that use price quotes in inactive markets, we analyze the degree 
of market inactivity and distressed transactions to determine the 
appropriate adjustment to the price quotes. We continually assess the level and volume of market activity in our investment security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to price quotes. Given market conditions can 
change over time, our determination of which securities markets 
are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a 
market to be inactive, the degree to which price quotes require 
adjustment, can also change. See Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) for discussion of the fair value hierarchy and 
valuation methodologies applied to financial instruments to 
determine fair value. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. 
On the date we enter into a derivative contract, we designate the 
derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or 
liability, including hedges of foreign currency exposure (ﬁfair 
value hedgeﬂ), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the 
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a 
recognized asset or liability (ﬁcash flow hedgeﬂ), or (3) held for 
trading, customer accommodation or asset/liability risk 
management purposes, including economic hedges not 
qualifying for hedge accounting. For a fair value hedge, we 
record changes in the fair value of the derivative and, to the 
extent that it is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, in current period 
earnings in the same financial statement category as the hedged 
item. For a cash flow hedge, we record changes in the fair value 
of the derivative to the extent that it is effective in OCI, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded in current period earnings. We 
subsequently reclassify these changes in fair value to net income 
in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction affects net 
income in the same financial statement category as the hedged 
item. For derivatives not designated as a fair value or cash flow 
hedge, we report changes in the fair values in current period 
noninterest income. For fair value and cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at inception the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our evaluation of 
effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This includes linking all 
derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to 
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific 
forecasted transactions. Periodically, as required, we also 
formally assess whether the derivative we designated in each 
hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the 
hedged item using the regression analysis method. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in 
the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) we elect to 
discontinue the designation of a derivative as a hedge, or (4) in a 
cash flow hedge, a derivative is de-designated because it is not 
probable that a forecasted transaction will occur. When we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no longer adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes 
in fair value, and cumulative adjustments to the hedged item are 
accounted for in the same manner as other components of the 
carrying amount of the asset or liability. If the derivative 
continues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we 
carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value with 
changes in fair value included in earnings. When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the 
accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date 
continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction 
affects earnings. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued 
and it is probable the forecasted transaction will not occur, the 
accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date 
is immediately recognized in earnings. If the derivative 
continues to be held after cash flow hedge accounting ceases, we 
carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value with 
future changes in fair value included in earnings. We may purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the financial 
instrument, we assess (1) if the economic characteristics of the 
embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the 
economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host 
contract), (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the 
embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at 
fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) 
if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded 
instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the 
embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate it 
from the host contract by recording the bifurcated derivative at 
fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference 
between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of 
the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at 
fair value with changes recorded in current period earnings. By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that counterparties to the derivative 
contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to 
perform, our counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount 
reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The amounts 
reported as a derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain 
position, and to the extent subject to legally enforceable master 
netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with 
the same counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize 
counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, 
monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements 
and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. To the extent 
derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the 
applicable requirements, including determining the legal 147 €€Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivatives balances and related cash collateral amounts net on 
the balance sheet. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives 
is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of 
hedge effectiveness. Private Share Repurchases During 2014 and 2013, we repurchased approximately 
66€million shares and 40 million shares of our common stock, 

respectively, under private forward repurchase contracts. We 
enter into these transactions with unrelated third parties to 
complement our open-market common stock repurchase 
strategies, to allow us to manage our share repurchases in a 
manner consistent with our capital plans, currently submitted 
under the 2014 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR), and to provide an economic benefit to the Company. Our payments to the counterparties for these private share repurchase contracts are recorded in permanent equity in the 
quarter paid and are not subject to re-measurement. The 
classification of the up-front payments as permanent equity 
assures that we have appropriate repurchase timing consistent 
with our 2014 capital plan, which contemplated a fixed dollar 
amount available per quarter for share repurchases pursuant to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) supervisory guidance. In return, 
the counterparty agrees to deliver a variable number of shares 
based on a per share discount to the volume-weighted average 
stock price over the contract period. There are no scenarios 
where the contracts would not either physically settle in shares 
or allow us to choose the settlement method. In fourth quarter 2014, we entered into a private forward repurchase contract and paid $750 million to an unrelated third 

party. This contract settled in first quarter 2015 for 14.3 million 

shares of common stock. At December 31, 2013, we had a 
$500€million private forward repurchase contract outstanding 
that settled in first quarter 2014 for 11.1 million shares of 

common stock. Our total number of outstanding shares of 
common stock is not reduced until settlement of the private 
share repurchase contract. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Noncash activities are presented below, including information on

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS We have evaluated the effects of events that have occurred subsequent to December€31, 2014, and there 

have been no material events that would require recognition in 
our 2014 consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the

We regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial services companies and businesses. Generally, we do not make a public 
announcement about an acquisition opportunity until a 
definitive agreement has been signed. For information on 
additional contingent consideration related to acquisitions, 
which is considered to be a guarantee, see Note 14 (Guarantees, 
Pledged Assets and Collateral). During 2014, we completed an acquisition of a railcar and locomotive leasing business with combined total assets of 
$422€million. We had no pending business combinations as of 

December 31, 2014. Additionally, no business combinations were 

completed in 2013. Business combinations completed in 2014

Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulations require that each of our subsidiary banks maintain reserve balances on deposit with 
the Federal Reserve Banks. The total daily average required 
reserve balance for all our subsidiary banks was $12.9 billion in 

2014 and $11.8 billion in 2013. 
Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit and non-credit transactions between a bank and its 
nonbank affiliates. They may not exceed 10% of the bank's 

capital and surplus (which for this purpose represents Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital (RBC) 
guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses 
excluded from Tier 2 capital) with any single nonbank affiliate 
and 20% of the bank's capital and surplus with all its nonbank 
affiliates. Transactions that are extensions of credit may require 
collateral to be held to provide added security to the bank. For 
further discussion of RBC, see Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) in this Report. Dividends paid by our subsidiary banks are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations. Dividends that 
may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are limited 
to that bank's retained net profits for the preceding two calendar 
years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend 
declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as 
defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends 
declared during the period.€We also have a state-chartered subsidiary bank that is subject to state regulations that limit dividends. Under these 
provisions and regulatory limitations, our national and state-
chartered subsidiary banks could have declared additional 
dividends of $15.6 billion at December 31, 2014,without 

obtaining prior regulatory approval. We have elected to retain 
capital at our national and state-chartered subsidiary banks to 
meet internal capital policy minimums and regulatory 
requirements associated with the implementation of Basel III. 
Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and 
state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount 
of dividends that may be paid in any given year. Based on 
retained earnings at December 31, 2014, our nonbank 
subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of 
$8.6€billion at December 31, 2014, without obtaining prior 
approval. The FRB published clarifying supervisory guidance in first quarter 2009, SR 09-4 Applying Supervisory Guidance and 
Regulations on the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions, 
and Stock Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies, pertaining 
to FRB's criteria, assessment and approval process for 
reductions in capital. The FRB supplemented this guidance with 
the Capital Plan Rule issued in fourth quarter 2011 (codified at 
12 CFR 225.8 of Regulation Y) that establishes capital planning 
and prior notice and approval requirements for capital 
distributions including dividends by certain bank holding 
companies. The effect of this guidance is to require the approval 
of the FRB (or specifically under the Capital Plan Rule, a notice 
of non-objection) for the Company to repurchase or redeem 
common or perpetual preferred stock as well as to raise the per 
share quarterly dividend from its current level of $0.35 per share 

as declared by the Company™s Board of Directors on

(continued) We have assessed each security with gross unrealized losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not 
intend to sell any of the securities and that it is more likely than 
not that we will not be required to sell prior to recovery of the 
amortized cost basis. For debt securities, we evaluate, where 
necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the 
present value of the expected cash flows to the securities™ 
amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we consider 
numerous factors in determining whether impairment exists, 
including our intent and ability to hold the securities for a period 
of time sufficient to recover the cost basis of the securities. For complete descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing securities for impairment, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) and below. SECURITIES OF U.S. TREASURY AND FEDERAL AGENCIES 
AND FEDERAL AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) The unrealized losses associated with U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and not due to credit losses 
given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. 
government. SECURITIES OF U.S. STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS The unrealized losses associated with securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are primarily driven by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding 
credit curves rather than by changes to the credit quality of the 
underlying securities. Substantially all of these investments are 
investment grade. The securities were generally underwritten in 
accordance with our own investment standards prior to the 
decision to purchase. Some of these securities are guaranteed by 
a bond insurer, but we did not rely on this guarantee when 
making our investment decision. These investments will 
continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing impairment 
analysis but are expected to perform, even if the rating agencies 
reduce the credit rating of the bond insurers. As a result, we 
expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these 
securities. RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MBS The unrealized losses associated with private residential MBS and commercial MBS 
are primarily driven by changes in projected collateral losses, 
credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for credit 
impairment by estimating the present value of expected cash 
flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows 
include default rates, loss severities and/or prepayment rates. 
We estimate losses to a security by forecasting the underlying 
mortgage loans in each transaction. We use forecasted loan 
performance to project cash flows to the various tranches in the 
structure. We also consider cash flow forecasts and, as 
applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, 
sector credit ratings, and other independent market data. Based 
upon our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit 
enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the 
entire amortized cost basis of these securities. CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES€The unrealized losses associated with corporate debt securities are primarily related to 
unsecured debt obligations issued by various corporations. We 
evaluate the financial performance of each issuer on a quarterly 
basis to determine if the issuer can make all contractual 
principal and interest payments. Based upon this assessment, we 
expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these 
securities. COLLATERALIZED LOAN AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS€The unrealized losses associated with collateralized loan and 
other debt obligations relate to securities primarily backed by 
commercial, residential or other consumer collateral. The 
unrealized losses are primarily driven by changes in projected 
collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for 
credit impairment by estimating the present value of expected 
cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash 
flows include default rates, loss severities and prepayment rates. 
We also consider cash flow forecasts and, as applicable, 
independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit 
ratings, and other independent market data. Based upon our 
assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit 
enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the 
entire amortized cost basis of these securities. OTHER DEBT SECURITIES€The unrealized losses associated with other debt securities predominantly relate to other asset-
backed securities. The losses are primarily driven by changes in 
projected collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We 
assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of 
expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining 
expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities and 
prepayment rates. Based upon our assessment of the expected 
credit losses and the credit enhancement level of the securities, 
we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these 
securities. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES Our marketable equity securities include investments in perpetual preferred securities, 
which provide attractive tax-equivalent yields. We evaluate these 
hybrid financial instruments with investment-grade ratings for 
impairment using an evaluation methodology similar to that 
used for debt securities. Perpetual preferred securities are not 
considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if there is no 
evidence of credit deterioration or investment rating downgrades 
of any issuers to below investment grade, and we expect to 
continue to receive full contractual payments. We will continue 
to evaluate the prospects for these securities for recovery in their 
market value in accordance with our policy for estimating OTTI. 
We have recorded impairment write-downs on perpetual 
preferred securities where there was evidence of credit 
deterioration. OTHER INVESTMENT SECURITIES MATTERS€
The fair values of our investment securities could decline in the future if the 
underlying performance of the collateral for the residential and 
commercial MBS or other securities deteriorate, and our credit 
enhancement levels do not provide sufficient protection to our 
contractual principal and interest. As a result, there is a risk that 
significant OTTI may occur in the future. 154 The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt and perpetual preferred investment securities by those rated investment grade and those rated less than 
investment grade according to their lowest credit rating by 
Standard & Poor™s Rating Services (S&P) or Moody™s Investors 
Service (Moody™s). Credit ratings express opinions about the 
credit quality of a security. Securities rated investment grade, 
that is those rated BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by 
Moody™s, are generally considered by the rating agencies and 
market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, securities 
rated below investment grade, labeled as "speculative grade" by 
the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade securities. We have also 
included securities not rated by S&P or Moody™s in the table 
below based on our internal credit grade of the securities (used 
for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit 
rating assigned by major credit agencies. The unrealized losses 
and fair value of unrated securities categorized as investment 
grade based on internal credit grades were $25 million and 

$1.6€billion, respectively, at December€31, 2014, and $18 million 

and $1.9 billion, respectively, at December€31, 2013.€If an 

internal credit grade was not assigned, we categorized the 
security as non-investment grade. Investment grade Non-investment grade (in millions) Gross unrealized losses€Fair value€Gross unrealized losses€Fair value€December 31, 2014 Available-for-sale securities: Securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies $ (138)

loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that would cause 
them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. 
At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not have concentrations 
representing 10% or more of our total loan portfolio in domestic 

commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry 
or CRE loans (real estate mortgage and real estate construction) 
by state or property type. Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
loans to borrowers in the state of California represented 
approximately 13% of total loans at both December 31, 2014 

and€2013, of which 2% were PCI loans in both years. These 
California loans are generally diversified among the larger 
metropolitan areas in California, with no single area consisting 
of more than 4% of total loans. We continuously monitor 

changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market 
conditions for all geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family 
mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk management 
process. Some of our real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans include an interest-only feature as part of the 
loan terms.€These interest-only loans were approximately 12% of 

total loans at December 31, 2014, and€15% at December 31, 2013. 

Substantially all of these interest-only loans at origination were 
considered to be prime or near prime. We do not offer option 
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products, nor do we offer 
variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, 
commonly referred to within the financial services industry as 
negative amortizing mortgage loans. We acquired an option 
payment loan portfolio (Pick-a-Pay) from Wachovia at 
December 31, 2008. A majority of the portfolio was identified as 
PCI loans. Since the acquisition, we have reduced our exposure 
to the option payment portion of the portfolio through our 
modification efforts and loss mitigation actions. At 
December€31,€2014, approximately 2% of total loans remained 
with the payment option feature compared with 10% at 

December 31, 2008. Our first and junior lien lines of credit products generally have a draw period of 10 years (with some up to 15 or 20 years) 

with variable interest rate and payment options during the draw 
period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of total outstanding 
balance plus accrued interest. During the draw period, the 
borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line 
from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including 
interest-only payments for a fixed period between three to seven 

years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between 
five to 30 years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit 

generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with 
repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time 

of conversion. At December 31, 2014, our lines of credit portfolio 
had an outstanding balance of $69.7 billion, of which 

$6.2€billion, or 9%, is in its amortization period, another 

$13.3€billion, or 19%, of our total outstanding balance, will reach 

their end of draw period during 2015 through 2016, 
$14.2€billion, or 20%, during 2017 through 2019, and 

$36.0€billion, or 52%, will convert in subsequent years. This 

portfolio had unfunded credit commitments of $70.1 billion at 

December 31, 2014. The lines that enter their amortization 
period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss 
rates than the ones in their draw period. At December€31, 2014, 

$425 million, or 7%, of outstanding lines of credit that are in 

their amortization period were 30 or more days past due, 
compared with $1.3 billion, or 2%, for lines in their draw period. 

We have considered this increased inherent risk in our allowance 
for credit loss estimate. In anticipation of our borrowers 
reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we have 
created a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers 
transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full 
repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers 
moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing 
program strategy. Loan Purchases, Sales, and Transfers The following table summarizes the proceeds paid or received for 
purchases and sales of loans and transfers from loans held for 
investment to mortgages/loans held for sale at lower of cost or 
fair value. This loan activity primarily includes loans purchased 
and sales of whole loan or participating interests, whereby we 
receive or transfer a portion of a loan after origination. The table 
excludes PCI loans and loans recorded at fair value, including 
loans originated for sale because their loan activity normally 
does not impact the allowance for credit losses. Year ended December 31, 20142013 (in millions)Commercial Consumer Total Commercial Consumer Total Purchases (1) $ 4,952 1,365 6,317 10,914 581 11,495Sales (1,706)

are able to buy delinquent insured/guaranteed loans out of the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pools. These loans have different risk characteristics 

from the rest of our consumer portfolio, whereby this activity does not impact the allowance for loan losses in the same manner because the loans are predominantly 

insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Such purchases net of transfers to MHFS were $2.9 billion 

and $8.2 billion for the year ended 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
161 Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 
(continued) Commitments to Lend A commitment to lend is a legally binding agreement to lend funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, 
and for specific purposes and time periods. We generally require 
a fee to extend such commitments. Certain commitments are 
subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the 
financial performance of the customer or borrowing base 
formulas on an ongoing basis that must be met before we are 
required to fund the commitment. We may reduce or cancel 
consumer commitments, including home equity lines and credit 
card lines, in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. We may, as a representative for other lenders, advance funds or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under 
syndicated loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are 
generally repaid in less than a week and would normally require 
default of both the customer and another lender to expose us to 
loss. These temporary advance arrangements totaled 
approximately $87 billion at both December€31, 2014, and 

December€31, 2013. 
We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At 
both December€31, 2014 and 2013, we had $1.2 billion of 

outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. We also 
originate multipurpose lending commitments under which 
borrowers have the option to draw on the facility for different 
purposes in one of several forms, including a standby letter of 
credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral) 
for additional information on standby letters of credit. When we make commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally 
be lower than the contractual amount because a significant 
portion of these commitments are expected to expire without 
being used by the customer. In addition, we manage the 
potential risk in commitments to lend by limiting the total 
amount of commitments, both by individual customer and in 
total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these 
commitments and by applying the same credit standards for 
these commitments as for all of our credit activities. For loans and commitments to lend, we may require collateral or a guarantee. We may require various types of 
collateral, including commercial and consumer real estate, 
automobiles, other short-term liquid assets such as accounts 
receivable or inventory and long-lived asset, such as equipment 
and other business assets. Collateral requirements for each loan 
or commitment may vary based on the loan product and our 
assessment of a customer's credit risk according to the specific 
credit underwriting, including terms and structure. The contractual amount of our unfunded credit commitments, including unissued standby and commercial 
letters of credit, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of 
financing receivable in the following table. The table excludes 
standby and commercial letters of credit issued under the terms 
of our commitments and temporary advance commitments on 
behalf of other lenders.

Credit Quality We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness 
of the allowance for credit losses. The following sections provide 
the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit 
quality indicators are generally based on information as of our 
financial statement date, with the exception of updated Fair 
Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-value 
(LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV), which are obtained at least 
quarterly. Generally, these indicators are updated in the second 
month of each quarter, with updates no older than 
September€30, 2014. See the ﬁPurchased Credit-Impaired Loansﬂ 
section of this Note for credit quality information on our PCI 
portfolio. COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS In addition to monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Generally, commercial loans are subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 
ratings. Our ratings are aligned to Pass and Criticized categories. 
The Criticized category includes Special Mention, Substandard, 
and Doubtful categories which are defined by bank regulatory 
agencies. The following table provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial loans by risk category. Of the $8.3 billion in 

criticized commercial real estate (CRE) loans at 
December€31,€2014, $1.7 billion has been placed on nonaccrual 

status and written down to net realizable collateral value. CRE 
loans have a high level of monitoring in place to manage these 
assets and mitigate loss exposure. 164 Commercial Real estate Real estate Lease (in millions) and industrial€mortgage€construction€financing€Total€December 31, 2014 By risk category: Pass $ 255,611

The following table provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio by updated FICO. We obtain FICO scores at loan 
origination and the scores are updated at least quarterly. The 
majority of our portfolio is underwritten with a FICO score of 
680 and above. FICO is not available for certain loan types and 
may not be obtained if we deem it unnecessary due to strong 
collateral and other borrower attributes, primarily security-
based loans of $5.9 billion at December€31, 2014, and

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan™s unpaid principal balance to the property™s collateral value. CLTV refers 
to the combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. LTVs and CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. 
The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high 
value properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or 
more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. The following table shows the most updated LTV and CLTV distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loan portfolios. We consider the trends in residential real estate markets as we monitor credit risk and establish our allowance for credit losses. In the event of a default, any loss should be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV primarily due to industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions. 167 Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

commercial portfolio segment and loans modified in a TDR, 
whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. These impaired loans 
generally have estimated losses which are included in the 
allowance for credit losses. We have impaired loans with no 
allowance for credit losses when loss content has been previously 
recognized through charge-offs and we do not anticipate additional charge-offs or losses, or certain loans are currently 
performing in accordance with their terms and for which no loss 
has been estimated. Impaired loans exclude PCI loans. The table 
below includes trial modifications that totaled $452 million at

293 990 171 €Note 6: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 
(continued) TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)€When, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower™s financial difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant 
period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. We do not 
consider any loans modified through a loan resolution such as 
foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period 
of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While 
loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not 
considered modified and they continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original 
terms. The planned modifications for these arrangements 
predominantly involve interest rate reductions or other interest 
rate concessions; however, the exact concession type and 
resulting financial effect are usually not finalized and do not take 
effect until the loan is permanently modified. The trial period 
terms are developed in accordance with our proprietary 
programs or the U.S. Treasury™s Making Homes Affordable 
programs for real estate 1-4 family first lien (i.e. Home 
Affordable Modification Program Œ HAMP) and junior lien (i.e. 
Second Lien Modification Program Œ 2MP) mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, the loans in trial modification period were $149 million under HAMP, $34 million under 2MP and 

$269 million under proprietary programs, compared with 

$253€million, $45 million and $352 million at 

December€31,€2013, respectively. Trial modifications with a 
recorded investment of $167 million at December 31, 2014, and 

$286 million at December 31, 2013, were accruing loans and 
$285 million and $364 million, respectively, were nonaccruing 
loans. Our experience is that substantially all of the mortgages 
that enter a trial payment period program are successful in 
completing the program requirements and are then permanently 
modified at the end of the trial period. Our allowance process 
considers the impact of those modifications that are probable to 
occur. The following table summarizes our TDR modifications for the periods presented by primary modification type and includes 
the financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that 
modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that 
occurred during the period. 172 Primary modification type (1)€Financial effects of modifications Recorded Weighted investment average related to Interest rate Other interest€rate€interest rate (in millions) Principal (2)€reduction€concessions (3) Total€Charge-€offs (4)€reduction€reduction (5) Year ended December 31, 2014 Commercial: Commercial and industrial $ 4 51 914 969 36 1.53 % $ 51 Real estate mortgage 7 182 929 1,118 Š 1.21 182 Real estate construction Š 10 270 280 Š 2.12 10 Total commercial11 243 2,113 2,367 36 1.32 243 Consumer: Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage 571 401 2,690 3,662 92 2.50 833 Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage 50 114 246 410 64 3.27 157 Credit cardŠ 155 Š 155 Š 11.40 155 Automobile2 5 85 92 36 8.56 5 Other revolving credit and installment Š 12 16 28 Š 5.26 12 Trial modifications (6)Š Š (74)

once in the first modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $2.1 billion, $3.1 billion and 

$3.9€billion, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. 
(2) Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower 

performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate. 
(3) Other concessions include loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or 

reduce the contractual interest rate. 
(4) Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if 

the loan has been charged down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal 

modification. Modifications resulted in legally forgiving principal (actual, contingent or deferred) of $149 million, $393 million and $495 million for the years ended

Total $ 738 871 901 179 Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities€
Involvement with SPEs In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts or partnerships 
that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are 
formed in connection with securitization transactions. In a 
securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to an SPE, which then issues to investors various forms of interests in those assets and may also enter into derivative transactions. In a securitization transaction, we typically receive cash and/or other interests in an SPE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. Also, in certain transactions, we may retain the right to service the transferred receivables and to repurchase those receivables from the SPE if the outstanding 
balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds 
the benefits of servicing such receivables. In addition, we may 
purchase the right to service loans in an SPE that were 
transferred to the SPE by a third party. In connection with our securitization activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with SPEs, which may 
include: 
Ł underwriting securities issued by SPEs and subsequently 
making markets in those securities; Ł providing liquidity facilities to support short-term 
obligations of SPEs issued to third party investors; Ł providing credit enhancement on securities issued by SPEs 
or market value guarantees of assets held by SPEs through 
the use of letters of credit, financial guarantees, credit 
default swaps and total return swaps; Ł entering into other derivative contracts with SPEs; Ł holding senior or subordinated interests in SPEs; Ł acting as servicer or investment manager for SPEs; and Ł providing administrative or trustee services to SPEs. SPEs are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). A VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the ability to control the entity™s activities or lack the ability to receive expected benefits or absorb obligations in a 
manner that™s consistent with their investment in the entity. A 
VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, the party that has 
both the power to direct the activities that most significantly 
impact the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be 
significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, 
ownership or other interest that changes with changes in the fair 
value of the VIE™s net assets. To determine whether or not a 
variable interest we hold could potentially be significant to the 
VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors 
regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the 
VIE. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of 
a VIE on an on-going basis. We have segregated our involvement with VIEs between those VIEs which we consolidate, those which we do not 
consolidate and those for which we account for the transfers of 
financial assets as secured borrowings. Secured borrowings are 
transactions involving transfers of our financial assets to third 
parties that are accounted for as financings with the assets 
pledged as collateral. Accordingly, the transferred assets remain 
recognized on our balance sheet. Subsequent tables within this 
Note further segregate these transactions by structure type. 180 The classifications of assets and liabilities in our balance sheet associated with our transactions with VIEs follow:€Transfers that we VIEs that VIEs that account for we do not we as secured (in millions)consolidate€consolidate€borrowings€Total€December 31, 2014 Cash $Š 117 4 121 Trading assets 2,165 Š 204 2,369 Investment securities (1)€18,271 875 4,592 23,738 Mortgages held for sale Š Š Š Š Loans 13,195 4,509 5,280 22,984 Mortgage servicing rights 12,562 Š Š 12,562 Other assets 7,456 316 52 7,824 Total assets53,649 5,817 10,132 69,598 Short-term borrowings Š Š 3,141 3,141 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 848 49 (2) 1 898 Long-term debt 2,585 1,628 (2) 4,990 9,203 Total liabilities3,433 1,677 8,132 13,242 Noncontrolling interestsŠ 103 Š 103 Net assets$ 50,216 4,037 2,000 56,253 December 31, 2013

$0 million and $9 million; and Long-term debt, $0 million and $29 million. 
(3) Amounts have been revised for "VIEs that we do not consolidate" to include assets and liabilities related to certain commercial mortgage securitizations and to conform to 

the current year presentation of long-term debt. 
Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs Our transactions with VIEs include securitizations of residential 
mortgage loans, CRE loans, student loans, auto loans and leases 
and dealer floorplan loans; investment and financing activities 
involving collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by asset-
backed and CRE securities, collateralized loan obligations 
(CLOs) backed by corporate loans, and other types of structured 
financing. We have various forms of involvement with VIEs, 
including servicing, holding senior or subordinated interests, 
entering into liquidity arrangements, credit default swaps and 
other derivative contracts. Involvements with these 
unconsolidated VIEs are recorded on our balance sheet primarily 
in trading assets, investment securities, loans, MSRs, other 
assets and other liabilities, as appropriate. The following tables provide a summary of unconsolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement, but 
we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our 
continuing involvement in an unconsolidated VIE to be significant when it relates to third-party sponsored VIEs for 
which we were not the transferor (unless we are servicer and 
have other significant forms of involvement) or if we were the 
sponsor only or sponsor and servicer but do not have any other 
forms of significant involvement. Significant continuing involvement includes transactions where we were the sponsor or transferor and have other 
significant forms of involvement. Sponsorship includes 
transactions with unconsolidated VIEs where we solely or 
materially participated in the initial design or structuring of the 
entity or marketing of the transaction to investors. When we 
transfer assets to a VIE and account for the transfer as a sale, we 
are considered the transferor. We consider investments in 
securities (other than those held temporarily in trading), loans, 
guarantees, liquidity agreements, written options and servicing 
of collateral to be other forms of involvement that may be 
significant. We have excluded certain transactions with

Also includes debt interests in the form of both loans and 
securities. Excludes certain debt securities held related to loans serviced for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA. 
(2) Excludes assets and related liabilities with a recorded carrying value on our balance sheet of $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for 

certain delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase primarily from GNMA loan securitizations. The recorded carrying value represents the amount that would be 

payable if the Company was to exercise the repurchase option. The carrying amounts are excluded from the table because the loans eligible for repurchase do not 

represent interests in the VIEs. (3) December 31, 2013, has been revised to include certain commercial mortgage securitizations with FNMA and GNMA to conform with current period presentation. (4) Represents senior loans to trusts that are collateralized by asset-backed securities. The trusts invest primarily in senior tranches from a diversified pool of primarily U.S. 

asset securitizations, of which all are current and 70% and 72% were rated as investment grade by the primary rating agencies at December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. These senior loans are accounted for at amortized cost and are subject to the Company™s allowance and credit charge-off policies. 
(5) Includes structured financing and credit-linked note structures. Also contains investments in auction rate securities (ARS) issued by VIEs that we do not sponsor and, 

accordingly, are unable to obtain the total assets of the entity. 
In the two preceding tables, ﬁTotal VIE assetsﬂ represents other commitments and guarantees. It represents estimated loss the remaining principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical VIEs using the most current information available. For VIEs that circumstances, for which we believe the possibility is extremely obtain exposure to assets synthetically through derivative remote, such as where the value of our interests and any instruments, the remaining notional amount of the derivative is associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration included in the asset balance. ﬁCarrying valueﬂ is the amount in of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, our consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with this required disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. the unconsolidated VIEs. ﬁMaximum exposure to lossﬂ from our 
involvement with off-balance sheet entities, which is a required RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS Residential mortgage loan disclosure under GAAP, is determined as the carrying value of securitizations are financed through the issuance of fixed-rate or our involvement with off-balance sheet (unconsolidated) VIEs floating-rate asset-backed securities, which are collateralized by plus the remaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, the loans transferred to a VIE. We typically transfer loans we the notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and originated to these VIEs, account for the transfers as sales, retain generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial 183 €€€€€€€Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) interests issued by the VIEs. We also may be exposed to limited liability related to recourse agreements and repurchase 
agreements we make to our issuers and purchasers, which are 
included in other commitments and guarantees. In certain 
instances, we may service residential mortgage loan 
securitizations structured by third parties whose loans we did 
not originate or transfer. Our residential mortgage loan 
securitizations consist of conforming and nonconforming 
securitizations. Conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations are those that are guaranteed by the government-sponsored entities 
(GSEs), including GNMA. Because of the power of the GSEs over 
the VIEs that hold the assets from these conforming residential 
mortgage loan securitizations, we do not consolidate them. The loans sold to the VIEs in nonconforming residential mortgage loan securitizations are those that do not qualify for a 
GSE guarantee. We may hold variable interests issued by the 
VIEs, primarily in the form of senior securities. We do not 
consolidate the nonconforming residential mortgage loan 
securitizations included in the table because we either do not 
hold any variable interests, hold variable interests that we do not 
consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer 
for a majority of the VIE assets. Other commitments and guarantees include amounts related to loans sold that we may be required to repurchase, or 
otherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor or insurer for 
losses incurred, due to material breach of contractual 
representations and warranties as well as other retained 
recourse arrangements. The maximum exposure to loss for 
material breach of contractual representations and warranties 
represents a stressed case estimate we utilize for determining 
stressed case regulatory capital needs and is considered to be a 
remote scenario. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS Commercial mortgage loan securitizations are financed through 
the issuance of fixed or floating-rate asset-backed securities, 
which are collateralized by the loans transferred to the VIE. In a 
typical securitization, we may transfer loans we originate to 
these VIEs, account for the transfers as sales, retain the right to 
service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued 
by the VIEs. In certain instances, we may service commercial 
mortgage loan securitizations structured by third parties whose 
loans we did not originate or transfer. We typically serve as 
primary or master servicer of these VIEs. The primary or master 
servicer in a commercial mortgage loan securitization typically 
cannot make the most significant decisions impacting the 
performance of the VIE and therefore does not have power over 
the VIE. We do not consolidate the commercial mortgage loan 
securitizations included in the disclosure because we either do 
not have power or do not have a variable interest that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOs) A CDO is a securitization where a VIE purchases a pool of assets consisting 
of asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches of equity 
or notes to investors. In some CDOs, a portion of the assets are 
obtained synthetically through the use of derivatives such as 
credit default swaps or total return swaps. In addition to our role as arranger we may have other forms of involvement with these CDOs. Such involvement may include 
acting as liquidity provider, derivative counterparty, secondary 
market maker or investor. For certain CDOs, we may also act as 
the collateral manager or servicer. We receive fees in connection 
with our role as collateral manager or servicer. We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of CDOs based on our role in them in combination with the variable 
interests we hold. Subsequently, we monitor our ongoing 
involvement to determine if the nature of our involvement has 
changed. We are not the primary beneficiary of these CDOs in 
most cases because we do not act as the collateral manager or 
servicer, which generally denotes power. In cases where we are 
the collateral manager or servicer, we are not the primary 
beneficiary because we do not hold interests that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS (CLOs) A CLO is a securitization where an SPE purchases a pool of assets consisting 
of loans and issues multiple tranches of equity or notes to 
investors. Generally, CLOs are structured on behalf of a third 
party asset manager that typically selects and manages the assets 
for the term of the CLO. Typically, the asset manager has the 
power over the significant decisions of the VIE through its 
discretion to manage the assets of the CLO. We assess whether 
we are the primary beneficiary of CLOs based on our role in 
them and the variable interests we hold. In most cases, we are 
not the primary beneficiary because we do not have the power to 
manage the collateral in the VIE. In addition to our role as arranger, we may have other forms of involvement with these CLOs. Such involvement may include 
acting as underwriter, derivative counterparty, secondary market 
maker or investor. For certain CLOs, we may also act as the 
servicer, for which we receive fees in connection with that role. 
We also earn fees for arranging these CLOs and distributing the 
securities. ASSET-BASED FINANCE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with VIEs that are 
collateralized by various asset classes including energy contracts, 
auto and other transportation leases, intellectual property, 
equipment and general corporate credit. We typically provide 
senior financing, and may act as an interest rate swap or 
commodity derivative counterparty when necessary. In most 
cases, we are not the primary beneficiary of these structures 
because we do not have power over the significant activities of 
the VIEs involved in them. In fourth quarter 2014, we sold $8.3 billion of government 
guaranteed student loans, including the rights to service the 
loans, to a third party, resulting in a $217 million gain. In 

connection with the sale, we provided $6.5 billion in floating-

rate loan financing to an asset backed financing entity (VIE) 
formed by the third party purchaser. Our financing, which is 
fully collateralized by government guaranteed student loans, is 
measured at amortized cost and classified in loans on the 
balance sheet. The collateral supporting our loan includes a 
portion of the student loans we sold. We are not the primary 
beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, are not required to 
consolidate the entity as we do not have power over the 
significant activities of the entity. For information on the 
estimated fair value of the loan and related sensitivity analysis, 
see the Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs section in 
this Note. In addition, we also have investments in asset-backed securities that are collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash. 
These fixed-rate and variable-rate securities have been 
structured as single-tranche, fully amortizing, unrated bonds 
that are equivalent to investment-grade securities due to their 
significant overcollateralization. The securities are issued by 
VIEs that have been formed by third party auto financing 
institutions primarily because they require a source of liquidity 184 €€€ €€ €€to fund ongoing vehicle sales operations. The third party auto financing institutions manage the collateral in the VIEs, which is 
indicative of power in them and we therefore do not consolidate 
these VIEs. TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES We co-sponsor and make investments in affordable housing and sustainable energy 
projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through 
the realization of federal tax credits. In some instances, our 
investments in these structures may require that we fund future 
capital commitments at the discretion of the project sponsors. 
While the size of our investment in a single entity may at times 
exceed 50% of the outstanding equity interests, we do not 

consolidate these structures due to the project sponsor™s ability 
to manage the projects, which is indicative of power in them. INVESTMENT FUNDS We do not consolidate the investment funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected 
future variability associated with the funds™ assets, including 
variability associated with credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH VIEs Auction rate securities 
price more frequently, and preferred equities with no maturity. 
At December 31, 2014, we held in our available-for-sale 
securities portfolio $567 million of ARS issued by VIEs 

compared with $653 million at December 31, 2013. We acquired 

the ARS pursuant to agreements entered into in 2008 and 2009. We do not consolidate the VIEs that issued the ARS because we do not have power over the activities of the VIEs. TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES VIEs that we wholly own issue debt securities or preferred equity to third party investors. 
All of the proceeds of the issuance are invested in debt securities 
or preferred equity that we issue to the VIEs. The VIEs™ operations and cash flows relate only to the issuance, 
administration and repayment of the securities held by third 
parties. We do not consolidate these VIEs because the sole assets 
of the VIEs are receivables from us, even though we own all of 
the voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the 
obligations of the VIEs and may have the right to redeem the 
third party securities under certain circumstances. In our 
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 and December 
31, 2013, we reported the debt securities issued to the VIEs as 
long-term junior subordinated debt with a carrying value of 
$2.1€billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, and the preferred 

equity securities issued to the VIEs as preferred stock with a 
carrying value of $2.5 billion at both dates. These amounts are in 

addition to the involvements in these VIEs included in the 
preceding table. In 2013, we redeemed $2.8 billion of trust preferred 
securities that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the 
Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel Committee recommendations 
known as the Basel III standards. Securitization Activity Related to Unconsolidated 
VIEs We use VIEs to securitize consumer and CRE loans and other 
types of financial assets. We typically retain the servicing rights 
from these sales and may continue to hold other beneficial 
interests in the VIEs. We may also provide liquidity to investors 
in the beneficial interests and credit enhancements in the form 
of standby letters of credit. Through these securitizations we 
may be exposed to liability under limited amounts of recourse as 
well as standard representations and warranties we make to 
purchasers and issuers. The following table presents the cash 
flows with our securitization trusts that were involved in 
transfers accounted for as sales.

In 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized net gains of $288€million, $149 million and $518 million, respectively, from 

transfers accounted for as sales of financial assets in 
securitizations. These net gains primarily relate to commercial 
mortgage securitizations and residential mortgage 
securitizations where the loans were not already carried at fair 
value. Sales with continuing involvement during 2014, 2013 and 2012 predominantly related to securitizations of residential 
mortgages that are sold to the GSEs, including FNMA, FHLMC 
and GNMA (conforming residential mortgage securitizations). 
During 2014, 2013 and 2012 we transferred $155.8 billion, 

$343.9 billion and $517.3 billion respectively, in fair value of 

conforming residential mortgages to unconsolidated VIEs and 
recorded the transfers as sales. Substantially all of these 
transfers did not result in a gain or loss because the loans were already carried at fair value. In connection with all of these 
transfers, in 2014 we recorded a $1.2 billion servicing asset, 

measured at fair value using a Level 3 measurement technique, 
available-for-sale securities of $751 million, classified as Level 2, 

and a $44 million liability for repurchase losses which reflects 

management™s estimate of probable losses related to various 
representations and warranties for the loans transferred, initially 
measured at fair value. In 2013, we recorded a $3.5 billion 

servicing asset and a $143 million liability. In 2012, we recorded 

a $4.9 billion servicing asset and a $275 million liability. 
2012 185  Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) We used the following key weighted-average assumptions to measure residential mortgage servicing rights at the date of securitization: Residential mortgage servicing rights€2014 2013 2012 Year ended December 31, Prepayment speed (1) 12.4% 
11.2 13.4 Discount rate 7.6 7.3 7.3 Cost to service ($ per loan) (2) $ 259 184 151 (1) The prepayment speed assumption for residential mortgage servicing rights 
includes a blend of prepayment speeds and default rates.€Prepayment speed 

assumptions are influenced by mortgage interest rate inputs as well as our 

estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
(2) Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs, which can vary 

period to period depending on the mix of modified government-guaranteed 

loans sold to GNMA. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we transferred $10.3 billion, 
$5.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, in fair value of 
commercial mortgages to unconsolidated VIEs and recorded the 
transfers as sales. These transfers resulted in a gain of 
$198€million in 2014, $152 million in 2013 and $178 million in 

2012, respectively, because the loans were carried at LOCOM. In 
connection with these transfers, in 2014 we recorded a servicing asset of $99 million, initially measured at fair value using a Level 

3 measurement technique, and available-for-sale securities of 
$100 million, classified as Level 2. In 2013, we recorded a 
servicing asset of $20 million and available-for-sale securities of 

$54 million. In 2012, we recorded a servicing asset of $13 million 

and available-for-sale securities of $116 million. 
Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs The following table provides key economic assumptions and the 
sensitivity of the current fair value of residential mortgage 
servicing rights and other retained interests to immediate 
adverse changes in those assumptions. ﬁOther interests heldﬂ 
relate predominantly to residential and commercial mortgage 
loan securitizations. Residential mortgage-backed securities 
retained in securitizations issued through GSEs, such as FNMA, 
FHLMC and GNMA, are excluded from the table because these 
securities have a remote risk of credit loss due to the GSE 
guarantee. These securities also have economic characteristics 
similar to GSE mortgage-backed securities that we purchase, 
which are not included in the table. Subordinated interests 
include only those bonds whose credit rating was below AAA by 
a major rating agency at issuance. Senior interests include only 
those bonds whose credit rating was AAA by a major rating 
agency at issuance. The information presented excludes trading 
positions held in inventory. 186 Other interests held ResidentialConsumer Commercial (2)mortgage servicing Interest-only Subordinated Subordinated Senior ($ in millions, except cost to service amounts) rights (1)€strips€bonds bonds bonds Fair value of interests held at December 31, 2014 $ 12,738 117 36 294 546 Expected weighted-average life (in years) 5.7 3.9 5.5 2.9 6.2 Key economic assumptions: Prepayment speed assumption (3) 12.5%

(2) Prepayment speed assumptions do not significantly impact the value of commercial mortgage securitization bonds as the underlying commercial mortgage loans experience 
significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions, impacting the borrower™s ability to prepay the mortgage. 
(3) The prepayment speed assumption for residential mortgage servicing rights includes a blend of prepayment speeds and default rates.€Prepayment speed assumptions are 

influenced by mortgage interest rate inputs as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
187 Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) In addition to residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) included in the previous table, we have a small portfolio of commercial MSRs with a fair value of $1.6 billion at both 

December 31, 2014 and 2013. The nature of our commercial 
MSRs, which are carried at LOCOM, is different from our 
residential MSRs. Prepayment activity on serviced loans does 
not significantly impact the value of commercial MSRs because, 
unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience 
significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual 
restrictions, impacting the borrower™s ability to prepay the 
mortgage. Additionally, for our commercial MSR portfolio, we 
are typically master/primary servicer, but not the special 
servicer, who is separately responsible for the servicing and 
workout of delinquent and foreclosed loans. It is the special 
servicer, similar to our role as servicer of residential mortgage 
loans, who is affected by higher servicing and foreclosure costs 
due to an increase in delinquent and foreclosed loans. 
Accordingly, prepayment speeds and costs to service are not key 
assumptions for commercial MSRs as they do not significantly 
impact the valuation. The primary economic driver impacting 
the fair value of our commercial MSRs is forward interest rates, 
which are derived from market observable yield curves used to 
price capital markets instruments. Market interest rates most 
significantly affect interest earned on custodial deposit balances. 
The sensitivity of the current fair value to an immediate adverse 
25% change in the assumption about interest earned on deposit 
balances at December 31, 2014, and 2013, results in a decrease in 
fair value of $185 million and $175 million, respectively. See 

Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for further information on 
our commercial MSRs. We also have a $6.5 billion loan to an unconsolidated third party VIE that we extended in fourth quarter 2014 in 
conjunction with our sale of government guaranteed student 
loans. The loan is carried at amortized cost and approximates 
fair value at December 31, 2014. The estimated fair value of the 
loan is considered a Level 3 measurement that is determined 
using discounted cash flows that are based on changes in the 
discount rate due to changes in the risk premium component (credit spreads). The primary economic assumption impacting 
the fair value of our loan is the discount rate. Changes in the 
credit loss assumption are not expected to affect the estimated 
fair value of the loan due to the government guarantee of the 
underlying collateral. The sensitivity of the current fair value to 
an immediate adverse increase of 200 basis points in the risk 
premium component of the discount rate assumption is a 
decrease in fair value of $130 million at December 31, 2014. For 

more information on the student loan sale, see the discussion on 
Asset-Based Finance Structures earlier in this Note. The sensitivities in the preceding paragraphs and table are hypothetical and caution should be exercised when relying on 
this data. Changes in value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the 
change in the assumption to the change in value may not be 
linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption 
on the value of the other interests held is calculated 
independently without changing any other assumptions. In 
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in others (for 
example, changes in prepayment speed estimates could result in 
changes in the credit losses), which might magnify or counteract 
the sensitivities. Off-Balance Sheet Loans The following table presents information about the principal 
balances of off-balance sheet loans that were sold or securitized, 
including residential mortgage loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC, 
GNMA and other investors, for which we have some form of 
continuing involvement (primarily servicer). Delinquent loans 
include loans 90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, 
regardless of delinquency status. For loans sold or securitized 
where servicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we 
would only experience a loss if we were required to repurchase a 
delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in

$ 7,393 In addition to the transactions included in the previous table, at both December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, we had approximately $6.0 billion of private placement debt 

financing issued through a consolidated VIE. The issuance is 
classified as long-term debt in our consolidated financial 
statements. At December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, we 
pledged approximately $637 million and $6.6 billion in loans 

(principal and interest eligible to be capitalized), $5.7 billion and 

$160 million in available-for-sale securities, and $0 million and 

$180 million in cash and cash equivalents to collateralize the 
VIE™s borrowings, respectively. These assets were not transferred 
to the VIE, and accordingly we have excluded the VIE from the 
previous table. We have raised financing through the securitization of certain financial assets in transactions with VIEs accounted for 
as secured borrowings. We also consolidate VIEs where we are 
the primary beneficiary. In certain transactions we provide 
contractual support in the form of limited recourse and liquidity 
to facilitate the remarketing of short-term securities issued to 
third party investors. Other than this limited contractual 
support, the assets of the VIEs are the sole source of repayment 
of the securities held by third parties. MUNICIPAL TENDER OPTION BOND SECURITIZATIONS As part of our normal investment portfolio activities, we consolidate 
municipal bond trusts that hold highly rated, long-term, fixed-
rate municipal bonds, the majority of which are rated AA or 
better.€Our residual interests in these trusts generally allow us to 
capture the economics of owning the securities outright, and 
constructively make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, primarily 
by directing the sale of the municipal bonds owned by the 
vehicle. In addition, the residual interest owners have the right 
to receive benefits and bear losses that are proportional to 
owning the underlying municipal bonds in the trusts. The trusts 
obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that 
reprice on a weekly or other basis to third-party investors. Under 
certain conditions, if we elect to terminate the trusts and 
withdraw the underlying assets, the third party investors are 
entitled to a small portion of any unrealized gain on the 
underlying assets. We may serve as remarketing agent and/or 
liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have 
the right to tender the certificates at specified dates, often with 
as little as seven days™ notice. Should we be unable to remarket 
189 €€Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) the tendered certificates, we are generally obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities unless the bond™s 
credit rating has declined below investment grade or there has 
been an event of default or bankruptcy of the issuer and insurer. NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS€We have consolidated certain of our nonconforming residential mortgage loan securitizations in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance. We have 
determined we are the primary beneficiary of these 
securitizations because we have the power to direct the most 
significant activities of the entity through our role as primary 
servicer and also hold variable interests that we have determined 
to be significant. The nature of our variable interests in these 
entities may include beneficial interests issued by the VIE, 
mortgage servicing rights and recourse or repurchase reserve 
liabilities. The beneficial interests issued by the VIE that we hold 
include either subordinate or senior securities held in an amount 
that we consider potentially significant. INVESTMENT FUNDS€We have consolidated certain of our investment funds where we manage the assets of the fund and 
our interests absorb a majority of the funds™ variability. We 
consolidate these VIEs because we have discretion over the 
management of the assets and are the sole investor in these 
funds. 190 Note 9:€Mortgage Banking Activities€

and the provision for repurchase losses reduces net gains on 
mortgage loan origination/sales activities in "Mortgage banking" 
in our consolidated income statement. Because the level of 
mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic 
factors, investor demand strategies and other external 
conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans, 
the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is 
difficult to estimate and requires considerable management 
judgment. We maintain regular contact with the GSEs, the 
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and other significant 
investors to monitor their repurchase demand practices and 
issues as part of our process to update our repurchase liability 
estimate as new information becomes available. The Company 
reached settlements with both FHLMC and FNMA in 2013, that 
resolved substantially all repurchase liabilities associated with 
loans sold to FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009 and loans sold to 
FNMA that were originated prior to January 1, 2009. Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability 
that is reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible 
loss for representations and warranties does not represent a 
probable loss, and is based on currently available information, 
significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are 
subject to change. The high end of this range of reasonably 
possible losses in excess of our recorded liability was 
$973€million at December 31, 2014, and was determined based 
upon modifying the assumptions (particularly to assume 
significant changes in investor repurchase demand practices) 
utilized in our best estimate of probable loss to reflect what we 
believe to be the high end of reasonably possible adverse 
assumptions. Year ended December 31,€(in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Balance, beginning of year $ 899 2,206 1,326 Provision for repurchase losses: Loan sales 44 143 275 Change in estimate (1) (184)

196 €Note 13: Long-Term Debt€
We issue long-term debt denominated in multiple currencies, predominantly in U.S. dollars. Our issuances have both fixed and floating interest rates. As a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy, we often use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. We also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk. As a result, a major 
portion of the long-term debt presented below is hedged in a fair 
value or cash flow hedge relationship. See Note 16 (Derivatives) 
for further information on qualifying hedge contracts. Following is a summary of our long-term debt carrying values, reflecting unamortized debt discounts and premiums, and purchase accounting adjustments, where applicable. The interest rates displayed represent the range of contractual rates in effect at December€31, 2014. These interest rates do not 
include the effects of any associated derivatives designated in a 
hedge accounting relationship. December 31, 2014 2013 (in millions) Wells Fargo & Company (Parent only) Senior Fixed-rate notes Floating-rate notes

We issue 
DPLCs to provide credit enhancements for certain bond issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these instruments to make scheduled principal and interest 

payments, redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. We also originate multipurpose lending 

commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including as a standby letter of credit. Total maximum exposure to loss 

includes the portion of these facilities for which we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. 
(2) Written put options, which are in the form of derivatives, are also included in the derivative disclosure in Note 16 (Derivatives). 
(3) Includes amounts for liquidity agreements and contingent consideration that were previously reported separately. 
ﬁMaximum exposure to lossﬂ and ﬁNon-investment gradeﬂ are required disclosures under GAAP. Non-investment grade 
represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of 
being required to perform under the terms of the guarantee. If 
the underlying assets under the guarantee are non-investment 
grade (that is, an external rating that is below investment grade 
or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent to a below 
investment grade external rating), we consider the risk of 
performance to be high. Internal credit default grades are 
determined based upon the same credit policies that we use to 
evaluate the risk of payment or performance when making loans 
and other extensions of credit. These credit policies are further 
described in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses). Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical 
circumstance, despite what we believe is its extremely remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in the table above do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, this required disclosure is 
not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value, 
which is either fair value for derivative-related products or the 
allowance for lending-related commitments, is more 
representative of our exposure to loss than maximum exposure 
to loss. STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, which include performance and financial guarantees, for 
customers in connection with contracts between our customers 
and third parties. Standby letters of credit are agreements where 
we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a 
customer if the customer fails to meet their contractual 
obligations. We consider the credit risk in standby letters of 
credit and commercial and similar letters of credit in determining the allowance for credit losses. 199 €€ €€€Note 14:€Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral 
(continued) SECURITIES LENDING AND OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS€As a securities lending agent, we lend debt and equity securities from participating institutional clients™ portfolios to third-party 
borrowers. These arrangements are for an indefinite period of 
time whereby we indemnify our clients against default by the 
borrower in returning these lent securities. This indemnity is 
supported by collateral received from the borrowers and is 
generally in the form of cash or highly liquid securities that are 
marked to market daily. The fair value of securities loaned out at 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, totaled $211 million and 

$337€million, respectively. The fair value of collateral supporting 
the loaned securities was $218 million and $346 million at 

December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle transactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage 
customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that 
could occur for non-performance by our customers on 
transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions 
subject to the indemnifications may include customer 
obligations related to the settlement of margin accounts and 
short positions, such as written call options and securities 
borrowing transactions. Outstanding customer obligations were 
$950 million and $769 million and the related collateral was 
$5.6 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014, and 
December 31, 2013, respectively. Our estimate of maximum 
exposure to loss, which requires judgment regarding the range 
and likelihood of future events, was $5.7 billion as of 

December€31, 2014, and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. 
We enter into other types of indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we agree to 
indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and 
expenses incurred in connection with legal and other 
proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. 
These relationships or transactions include those arising from 
service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting 
agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements 
and various other business transactions or arrangements. 
Because the extent of our obligations under these agreements 
depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are 
unable to determine our potential future liability under these 
agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential 
mortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various 
representations and warranties. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking 
Activities) for additional information on the liability for 
mortgage loan repurchase losses. WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS Written put options are contracts that give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying 
instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price, and 
may include options, floors, caps and credit default swaps. These 
written put option contracts generally permit net settlement. 
While these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option 
is exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting 
trades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument. 
We offset substantially all put options written to customers with 
purchased options. Additionally, for certain of these contracts, 
we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying instrument 
as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under 
written put options is based on future market conditions and is 
only quantifiable at settlement. See Note 16 (Derivatives) for 
additional information regarding written derivative contracts. LOANS AND MHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE In certain loan sales or securitizations, we provide recourse to the buyer 
whereby we are required to indemnify the buyer for any loss on 
the loan up to par value plus accrued interest. We provide 
recourse, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under 
various programs and arrangements. Primarily all of these 
programs and arrangements require that we share in the loans™ 
credit exposure for their remaining life by providing recourse to 
the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-rata 

basis, in the event of borrower default. Under the remaining 
recourse programs and arrangements, if certain events occur 
within a specified period of time from transfer date, we have to 
provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify them for 
losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The maximum 
exposure to loss reported in the accompanying table represents 
the outstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized 
that are subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses 
per the contractual agreements. However, we believe the 
likelihood of loss of the entire balance due to these recourse 
agreements is remote and amounts paid can be recovered in 
whole or in part from the sale of collateral. During 2014 and 
2013 we repurchased $14 million and $33 million, respectively, 

of loans associated with these agreements. We also provide 
representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the 
various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure 
relative to these guarantees is separately considered and 
provided for, as necessary, in determination of our liability for 
loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and 
warranties. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for 
additional information on the liability for mortgage loan 
repurchase losses. FACTORING GUARANTEES Under certain factoring arrangements, we are required to purchase trade receivables 
from third parties, generally upon their request, if receivable 
debtors default on their payment obligations. See Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for additional 
information. OTHER GUARANTEES We are members of exchanges and clearing houses that we use to clear our trades and those of our 
customers. It is common that all members in these organizations 
are required to collectively guarantee the performance of other 
members. Our obligations under the guarantees are based on 
either a fixed amount or a multiple of the collateral we are 
required to maintain with these organizations. We have not 
recorded a liability for these arrangements as of the dates 
presented in the previous table because we believe the likelihood 
of loss is remote. Other guarantees also include liquidity agreements and contingent performance arrangements. We provide liquidity to 
certain off-balance sheet entities that hold securitized fixed-rate 
municipal bonds and consumer or commercial assets that are 
partially funded with the issuance of money market and other 
short-term notes. See Note 8 (Securitization and Variable 
Interest Entities) for additional information on securitization 
and VIEs. Under our contingent performance arrangements, we are required to pay the counterparties to transactions related to 
various customer relationships and lease agreements if third 
parties default on certain obligations. 200 €2013 Pledged Assets As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge assets to secure trust and public deposits, borrowings and letters of credit 
from the FHLB and FRB, securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase (repurchase agreements), and for other purposes as 
required or permitted by law or insurance statutory 
requirements. The types of collateral we pledge include 
securities issued by federal agencies, GSEs, domestic and foreign 
companies and various commercial and consumer loans. The 
following table provides the total carrying amount of pledged assets by asset type. The table excludes pledged consolidated VIE 
assets of $5.8 billion and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2014, and 

December 31, 2013, respectively, which can only be used to settle 
the liabilities of those entities. The table also excludes 
$10.1€billion and $15.3 billion in assets pledged in transactions 

accounted for as secured borrowings at December 31, 2014 and 
2013, respectively. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable

(3) Includes mortgages held for sale of $8.7 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Balance consists of mortgages held for sale and loans that 

are pledged under agreements that do not permit the secured parties to sell or repledge the collateral. Amounts exclude $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 

and 2013, respectively, of pledged loans recorded on our balance sheet representing certain delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase primarily from GNMA loan 

securitizations. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional information.

(continued) Offsetting of Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowing and Lending 
Agreements The table below presents resale and repurchase agreements 
subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities 
borrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities 
lending agreements (MSLA). We account for transactions 
subject to these agreements as collateralized financings, and 
those with a single counterparty are presented net on our 
balance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit 
balance sheet netting. Most transactions subject to these 
agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible 
for balance sheet netting. Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, such as securities or loans, and is not netted on the balance sheet 
against the related collateralized liability. Collateral we received includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our balance 
sheet. Collateral received or pledged may be increased or 
decreased over time to maintain certain contractual thresholds 
as the assets underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. 
Generally, these agreements require collateral to exceed the 
asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The following 
table includes the amount of collateral pledged or received 
related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. 
While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, U.S. 
GAAP requires disclosure in this table to limit the amount of 
such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or 
liability for€each counterparty. In addition to the amounts included in the table below, we also have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is 
disclosed within Note 16 (Derivatives). Dec. 31,€Dec. 31,€(in millions) 2014 Assets: Resale and securities borrowing agreements Gross amounts recognized 58,148 38,635 Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) (6,477)

we have the right to sell or repledge. These amounts include securities we have sold or repledged to others with a fair value of $40.8 billion at December 31, 2014 and 

$23.8 billion at December 31, 2013.

respectively, of which, the counterparty does not have the right to sell or repledge $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2014, and $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. 
(7) Represents the amount of our obligation that is not covered by pledged collateral and/or is not subject to an enforceable MRA or MSLA. 
2013 50 445 202 € € € € €Note 15:€Legal Actions 
Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business 
activities. These proceedings include actions brought against 
Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate 
related matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or 
our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our 
subsidiaries may be requested to provide information or 
otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct 
of investigations of other persons or industry groups. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries have generally 
denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, 
liability in all significant litigation pending against us, including 
the matters described below, and we intend to defend vigorously 
each case, other than matters we describe as having settled. 
Reserves are established for legal claims when payments 
associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be 
reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims 
may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
for those claims. FHA INSURANCE LITIGATION On October 9, 2012, the United States filed a complaint, captioned United States of America v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint makes claims with 
respect to Wells Fargo's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
lending program for the period 2001 to 2010. The complaint 
alleges, among other allegations, that Wells Fargo improperly 
certified certain FHA mortgage loans for United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
insurance that did not qualify for the program, and therefore 
Wells Fargo should not have received insurance proceeds from 
HUD when some of the loans later defaulted. The complaint 
further alleges Wells Fargo knew some of the mortgages did not 
qualify for insurance and did not disclose the deficiencies to 
HUD before making insurance claims. On December 1, 2012, 
Wells Fargo filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia seeking to enforce a release of Wells Fargo 
given by the United States, which was denied on February 12, 
2013. On April 11, 2013, Wells Fargo appealed the decision to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The 
Court affirmed the denial of Wells Fargo's motion on June 20, 
2014. Previous resolution discussions did not result in an 
acceptable final agreement. The parties are again engaged in 
discovery. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells€Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wachovia 
Corporation are named as defendants, separately or in 
combination, in putative class actions filed on behalf of a 
plaintiff class of merchants and in individual actions brought by 
individual merchants with regard to the interchange fees 
associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. 
These actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of New York. Visa, MasterCard and 
several banks and bank holding companies are named as defendants in various of these actions. The amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based 
on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks 
damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege 
that Visa, MasterCard and payment card issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege 
that enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and 
alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are 
anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other 
defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment 
Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other 
entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the 
Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard and 
the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, 
signed a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff 
merchants to resolve the consolidated class actions and reached 
a separate settlement in principle of the consolidated individual 
actions. The proposed settlement payments by all defendants in 
the consolidated class and individual actions total approximately 
$6.6 billion. The class settlement also provides for the 
distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of default 
interchange across all credit rate categories for a period of eight 

consecutive months. The Court granted final approval of the 
settlement, which is proceeding. Merchants have filed several 
ﬁopt-outﬂ actions. MORTGAGE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS€Government agencies continue investigations or examinations of 
certain mortgage related practices of Wells Fargo and 
predecessor institutions. Wells Fargo, for itself and for 
predecessor institutions, has responded, and continues to 
respond, to requests from government agencies seeking 
information regarding the origination, underwriting and 
securitization of residential mortgages, including sub-prime 
mortgages. ORDER OF POSTING LITIGATION€A series of putative class actions have been filed against Wachovia Bank, N.A. and 
Wells€Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as many other banks, 
challenging the high to low order in which the banks post debit 
card transactions to consumer deposit accounts. There are 
currently several such cases pending against Wells Fargo Bank 
(including the Wachovia Bank cases to which Wells Fargo 
succeeded), most of which have been consolidated in multi-
district litigation proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida. The bank defendants moved to 
compel these cases to arbitration under Supreme Court 
authority. On November€22, 2011, the Judge denied the motion. 
The bank defendants appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On October€26, 2012, the 
Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Court™s denial of the 
motion. Wells Fargo renewed its motion to compel arbitration 
with respect to the unnamed putative class members. On April€8, 
2013, the District Court denied the motion and Wells Fargo 
appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit. On February 10, 
2015, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the order based on the 
District Court's lack of jurisdiction until class certification has 
been determined, and remanded to the District Court for further 
proceedings. On August 10, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order in Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a case that was not consolidated in the multi-district proceedings, enjoining the bank™s use of the high to low posting 
method for debit card transactions with respect to the plaintiff 
class of California depositors, directing the bank to establish a 
different posting methodology and ordering remediation of 
approximately $203 million. On October 26, 2010, a final 
203  €Note 15:€Legal Actions 
(continued) judgment was entered in Gutierrez. On October€28, 2010, Wells€Fargo appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. On December€26, 2012, the Ninth Circuit reversed the 
order requiring Wells Fargo to change its order of posting and 
vacated the portion of the order granting remediation of 
approximately $203 million on the grounds of federal 

preemption. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court™s 
finding that Wells Fargo violated a California state law 
prohibition on fraudulent representations and remanded the 
case to the District Court for further proceedings. On 
August€5,€2013, the District Court entered a judgment against 
Wells Fargo in the approximate amount of $203 million, 

together with post-judgment interest thereon from 
October€25,€2010, and, effective as of July 15, 2013, enjoined 
Wells Fargo from making or disseminating additional 
misrepresentations about its order of posting of transactions. On 
August 7, 2013, Wells Fargo appealed the judgment to the Ninth 
Circuit. On October 29, 2014, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial 
court™s judgment against Wells Fargo for approximately 
$203€million, but limited the injunction to debit card 

transactions. Wells Fargo is presently considering its options. SECURITIES LENDING LITIGATION Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is involved in four separate actions brought by securities lending 
customers of Wells Fargo and Wachovia Bank in various courts. 
In general, each of the cases alleges losses based on claims that 
Wells Fargo violated fiduciary and contractual duties in its 
investment of collateral for loaned securities. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Minnesota, et al., v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. resulted in verdicts dismissing the claims against Wells Fargo. Plaintiffs 
have appealed the verdicts. The remaining cases are scheduled 
for trial in 2015. OUTLOOK€When establishing a liability for contingent litigation losses, the Company determines a range of potential losses for 
each matter that is both probable and estimable, and records the 
amount it considers to be the best estimate within the range. The 
high end of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation 
losses in excess of the Company™s liability for probable and 
estimable losses was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. For 

these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of 
possible losses in excess of the established liability that cannot 
be estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of 
counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, 
Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions 
against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries, including the 
matters described above, will not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo™s 
consolidated financial position. However, in the event of 
unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate 
resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to 
Wells Fargo™s results of operations for any particular period. 204 Note 16:€Derivatives 
We primarily use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, 
and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a 
qualifying hedge accounting relationship (fair value or cash flow 
hedge). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for 
customer accommodation, trading or other purposes. Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of 
derivatives. Such derivatives are typically designated as fair 
value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedges. This helps 
minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair 
values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest 
rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This 
approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of 
certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, 
foreign currency and other exposures do not have a significantly 
adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows and 
earnings. As a result of fluctuations in these exposures, hedged 
assets and liabilities will gain or lose fair value. In a fair value or 
economic hedge, the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will 
generally be offset by the gain or loss on the derivatives linked to 
the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we 
manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate 
fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives linked to hedged 
assets and liabilities, the hedged asset or liability is not adjusted 
and the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is generally 
reflected in other comprehensive income and not in earnings. We also offer various derivatives, including interest rate, commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, to our 
customers as part of our trading businesses. These derivative 
transactions, which involve us engaging in market-making 
activities or acting as an intermediary, are conducted in an effort 
to help customers manage their market price risks. We usually 
offset our exposure from such derivatives by entering into other 
financial contracts, such as separate derivative or security 
transactions. The customer accommodations and any offsetting 
derivatives are treated as customer accommodation, trading and 
other derivatives in our disclosures. Additionally, this category 
includes embedded derivatives that are required to be accounted 
for separately from their host contracts. The following table presents the total notional or contractual amounts and fair values for our derivatives. 
Derivative transactions can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet 
and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of 
the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is 
generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. Derivatives 
designated as qualifying hedging instruments and economic 
hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in other 
assets or other liabilities. Customer accommodation, trading and 
other derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
in trading assets, other assets or other liabilities. 205 Note 16: Derivatives

The following table provides information on the gross fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, the balance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. We execute substantially all 
of our derivative transactions under master netting 
arrangements. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash 
collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on 
a net basis within the balance sheet. The ﬁGross amounts 
recognizedﬂ column in the following table include $69.6 billion 

and $75.0 billion of gross derivative assets and liabilities, 
respectively, at December 31, 2014, and $59.8 billion and 

$66.1€billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013, with 

counterparties subject to enforceable master netting 
arrangements that are carried on the balance sheet net of 
offsetting amounts. The remaining gross derivative assets and 
liabilities of $18.9 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, at 

December 31, 2014 and $12.9 billion and $7.3 billion, 
respectively, at December 31, 2013, include those with counterparties subject to master netting arrangements for which we have not assessed the enforceability because they are with counterparties where we do not currently have positions to offset, those subject to master netting arrangements where we have not been able to confirm the enforceability and those not subject to master netting arrangements. As such,we do not net derivative balances or collateral within the balance sheet for these counterparties. We determine the balance sheet netting adjustments based on the terms specified within each master netting arrangement. 
We disclose the balance sheet netting amounts within the 
column titled ﬁGross amounts offset in consolidated balance 
sheet.ﬂ Balance sheet netting adjustments are determined at the 
counterparty level for which there may be multiple contract 
types. For disclosure purposes, we allocate these adjustments to 
the contract type for each counterparty proportionally based 
upon the ﬁGross amounts recognizedﬂ by counterparty. As a 
result, the net amounts disclosed by contract type may not 
represent the actual exposure upon settlement of the contracts. Balance sheet netting does not include non-cash collateral that we receive and pledge. For disclosure purposes, we present 
the fair value of this non-cash collateral in the column titled 
ﬁGross amounts not offset in consolidated balance sheet

207 Note 16: Derivatives 
(continued) Fair Value Hedges We use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest 
rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-
currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our 
exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk 
associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated 
long-term debt. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward 
contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain 
investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to changes 
in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. We also use 
interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in fair value for 
certain mortgages held for sale. The entire derivative gain or loss 
is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair 
value hedge relationships, except for those involving foreign-
term debt hedged with foreign currency forward derivatives for 
which the time value component of the derivative gain or loss 
related to the changes in the difference between the spot and 
forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness. We use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness, both at inception of the hedging relationship and 
on an ongoing basis. The regression analysis involves regressing 
the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument 
against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability 
being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The 
assessment includes an evaluation of the quantitative measures 
of the regression results used to validate the conclusion of high 
effectiveness. The following table shows the net gains (losses) recognized in the income statement related to derivatives in fair value 
hedging relationships.

hedge effectiveness. 
390 208 Cash Flow Hedges We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans and 
paid on certain floating-rate debt due to changes in the 
benchmark interest rate. Gains and losses on derivatives that are 
reclassified from OCI to interest income (for loans) and interest 
expense (for debt) in the current period are included in the line 
item in which the hedged item™s effect on earnings is recorded. 
All parts of gain or loss on these derivatives are included in the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness. We assess hedge effectiveness 
using regression analysis, both at inception of the hedging 
relationship and on an ongoing basis. The regression analysis 
involves regressing the periodic changes in cash flows of the 
hedging instrument against the periodic changes in cash flows of 
the forecasted transaction being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The assessment includes an evaluation of the 
quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate 
the conclusion of high effectiveness. Based upon current interest rates, we estimate that $758€million (pre tax) of deferred net gains on derivatives in OCI 

at December€31, 2014, will be reclassified into net interest 

income during the next twelve months. Future changes to 
interest rates may significantly change actual amounts 
reclassified to earnings. We are hedging our exposure to the 
variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for 
a maximum of 7 years. The following table shows the net gains (losses) recognized related to derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments We use economic hedge derivatives primarily to hedge the risk of 
changes in the fair value of certain residential MHFS, certain 
loans held for investment, residential MSRs measured at fair 
value, derivative loan commitments and other interests held. 
The resulting gain or loss on these economic hedge derivatives is 
reflected in mortgage banking noninterest income, net gains 
(losses) from equity investments and other noninterest income. The derivatives used to hedge MSRs measured at fair value, which include swaps, swaptions, constant maturity mortgages, 
forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and options 
contracts, resulted in net derivative gains of $3.5 billion in 2014, 

net derivative losses of $2.9 billion in 2013 and net derivative 

gains of $3.6 billion in 2012, which are included in mortgage 

banking noninterest income. The aggregate fair value of these 
derivatives was a net asset of $492 million at December€31, 2014 

and a net liability of $531 million at December€31, 2013. The 

change in fair value of these derivatives for each period end is 
due to changes in the underlying market indices and interest 
rates as well as the purchase and sale of derivative financial 
instruments throughout the period as part of our dynamic MSR 
risk management process. Interest rate lock commitments for mortgage loans that we intend to sell are considered derivatives. Our interest rate 
exposure on these derivative loan commitments, as well as 
substantially all residential MHFS, is hedged with economic 
hedge derivatives such as swaps, forwards and options, 
Eurodollar futures and options, and Treasury futures, forwards 
and options contracts. The derivative loan commitments, 
economic hedge derivatives and residential MHFS are carried at 
fair value with changes in fair value included in mortgage 
banking noninterest income. For the fair value measurement of 
interest rate lock commitments we include, at inception and 
during the life of the loan commitment, the expected net future 
cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan. Fair 
value changes subsequent to inception are based on changes in 
fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the exercise of 
the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will 
not fund within the terms of the commitment (referred to as a 
fall-out factor). The value of the underlying loan is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of time. 
However, changes in investor demand can also cause changes in 
the value of the underlying loan value that cannot be hedged. 
The aggregate fair value of derivative loan commitments on the 
balance sheet was a net asset of $98 million and a net liability of 

$26 million at December€31, 2014 and December€31, 2013, 

respectively, and is included in the caption ﬁInterest rate 
contractsﬂ under ﬁCustomer accommodation, trading and other 
derivativesﬂ in the first table in this Note. We also enter into various derivatives primarily to provide derivative products to customers. These derivatives are not 
linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to 
forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, 
therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter 
into derivatives for risk management that do not otherwise 
qualify for hedge accounting. They are carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value recorded as other noninterest income. Customer accommodation, trading and other derivatives also include embedded derivatives that are required to be 
accounted for separately from their host contract. We 
periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and CDs where the 
performance of the hybrid instrument notes is linked to an 
equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such indices. 
These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all of the 
cash flows or the value of the note in a manner similar to a 
derivative instrument and therefore are considered to contain an 
ﬁembeddedﬂ derivative instrument. The indices on which the 
performance of the hybrid instrument is calculated are not 
clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The 
ﬁembeddedﬂ derivative is separated from the host contract and 
accounted for as a derivative. Additionally, we may invest in 
hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, such as 
credit derivatives, that are not clearly and closely related to the 
host contract. In such instances, we either elect fair value option 
for the hybrid instrument or separate the embedded derivative 
from the host contract and account for the host contract and 
derivative separately. 209 Note 16: Derivatives

Credit Derivatives Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is 
derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or 
entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to 
another party (the seller of credit protection). We use credit 
derivatives primarily to assist customers with their risk 
management objectives. We may also use credit derivatives in 
structured product transactions or liquidity agreements written 
to special purpose vehicles. The maximum exposure of sold 
credit derivatives is managed through posted collateral, 
purchased credit derivatives and similar products in order to 
achieve our desired credit risk profile. This credit risk management provides an ability to recover a significant portion 
of any amounts that would be paid under the sold credit 
derivatives. We would be required to perform under the noted 
credit derivatives in the event of default by the referenced 
obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, 
capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest 
payment. In certain cases, other triggers may exist, such as the 
credit downgrade of the referenced obligors or the inability of 
the special purpose vehicle for which we have provided liquidity 
to obtain funding. The following table provides details of sold and purchased credit derivatives. 210 Notional amount Protection Protection (in millions) Fair value liability€Protection sold (A) sold - non-investment grade purchased with identical underlyings (B) Net protection sold (A)-(B)€Other protection purchased€Range of maturities€December 31, 2014 Credit default swaps on: Corporate bonds $ 23 6,344 2,904 4,894 1,450 2,831 2015 - 2021 Structured products 654 1,055 874 608 447 277 2017 - 2052 Credit protection on: Default swap index Š 1,659 292 777 882 1,042 2015 - 2019 Commercial mortgage-backed securities index 246 1,058 Š 608 450 355 2047 - 2063 Asset-backed securities index 19 52 1 1 51 81 2045 - 2046 Other 1 2,136 2,136 Š 2,136 5,185 2015 - 2025 Total credit derivatives $ 943 12,304 6,207 6,888 5,416 9,771 December 31, 2013

any associated collateral declines to zero, without any 
consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. 
We believe this hypothetical circumstance to be an extremely 
remote possibility and accordingly, this required disclosure is 
not an indication of expected loss. The amounts under non-
investment grade represent the notional amounts of those credit 
derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to 
perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a 
function of the underlying assets. We consider the risk of performance to be high if the underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external 
rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit 
default grade that is equivalent thereto. We believe the net 
protection sold, which is representative of the net notional 
amount of protection sold and purchased with identical 
underlyings, in combination with other protection purchased, is 
more representative of our exposure to loss than either non-
investment grade or protection sold. Other protection purchased 
represents additional protection, which may offset the exposure 
to loss for protection sold, that was not purchased with an 
identical underlying of the protection sold. Credit-Risk Contingent Features Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain 
major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand 
additional collateral or require termination or replacement of 
derivative instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate 

related contingent features that are in a net liability position was 
$13.6 billion at December€31, 2014, and $14.3 billion at 

December€31, 2013, respectively, for which we posted 

$10.5€billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, in collateral in the 

normal course of business. If the credit rating of our debt had 

risk-related contingent feature that if triggered requires the 
maximum amount of collateral to be posted, on December€31, 
2014, or December€31, 2013, we would have been required to 

post additional collateral of $3.1 billion or $2.5 billion, 

respectively, or potentially settle the contract in an amount equal 
to its fair value. Some contracts require that we provide more 
collateral than the fair value of derivatives that are in a net 
liability position if a downgrade occurs. Counterparty Credit Risk By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk 
if counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as 
expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty 
credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset 
on our balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset 
are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent 
subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net 
of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and 
cash collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk 
through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, 
executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, 
where appropriate. To the extent the master netting 
arrangements and other criteria meet the applicable 
requirements, including determining the legal enforceability of 
the arrangement, it is our policy to present derivative balances 
and related cash collateral amounts net on the balance sheet. We 
incorporate credit valuation adjustments (CVA) to reflect 
counterparty credit risk in determining the fair value of our 
derivatives. Such adjustments, which consider the effects of 
enforceable master netting agreements and collateral 
arrangements, reflect market-based views of the credit quality of 
each counterparty. Our CVA calculation is determined based on 
observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market and 
indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to 
our derivatives. 211 €€ € Note 17:€Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value 
disclosures. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis are presented in the recurring table in this Note. 
From time to time, we may be required to record at fair value 
other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as certain residential 
and commercial MHFS, certain LHFS, loans held for investment 
and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value 

market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Following is a discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded 
at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for 
estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at 
fair value. Fair Value Hierarchy We group our assets and liabilities measured at fair value in 
three levels based on the markets in which the assets and 
liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used 
to determine fair value. These levels are: 
Ł Level 1 Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical 
instruments traded in active markets. Ł Level 2 Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or 
similar instruments in markets that are not active, and 
model-based valuation techniques for which all significant 
assumptions are observable in the market. Ł Level 3 Œ Valuation is generated from techniques that use 
significant assumptions not observable in the market. These 
unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions 
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or 
liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing 
models, discounted cash flow models and similar 
techniques. In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market 
data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 
understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
used. For securities in inactive markets, we use a predetermined 
percentage to evaluate the impact of fair value adjustments 
derived from weighting both external and internal indications of 
value to determine if the instrument is classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3. Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each 
instrument or instrument category and judgments are made 
regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the 
instruments™ fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 

inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as 
Level 3. Assets SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS€Short-term financial assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and 
securities purchased under resale agreements and due from 
customers on acceptances. These assets are carried at historical cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of 
the instrument and its expected realization. TRADING ASSETS (EXCLUDING DERIVATIVES) AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES€€
sale securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are subject to impairment and fair value measurement if fair value declines below amortized cost and we do not expect to recover 
the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. Fair value 
measurement is based upon various sources of market pricing. 
We use quoted prices in active markets, where available, and 
classify such instruments within Level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Examples include exchange-traded equity securities 
and some highly liquid government securities, such as U.S. 
Treasuries. When instruments are traded in secondary markets 
and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we 
generally rely on internal valuation techniques or on prices 
obtained from vendors (predominantly third-party pricing 
services), and accordingly, we classify these instruments as Level 
2 or 3. Trading securities are mostly valued using internal trader prices that are subject to price verification procedures performed 
by separate internal personnel. The majority of fair values 
derived using internal valuation techniques are verified against 
multiple pricing sources, including prices obtained from third-
party vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and 
often apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is 
observable. We review pricing methodologies provided by the 
vendors in order to determine if observable market information 
is being used versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the 
appropriateness of an internal trader price compared with 
vendor prices, considerations include the range and quality of 
vendor prices. Vendor prices are used to ensure the 
reasonableness of a trader price; however valuing financial 
instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a 
particular market. If a trader asserts that a vendor price is not 
reflective of market value, justification for using the trader price, 
including recent sales activity where possible, must be provided 
to and approved by the appropriate levels of management. Similarly, while investment securities traded in secondary markets are typically valued using unadjusted vendor prices or 
vendor prices adjusted by weighting them with internal 
discounted cash flow techniques, these prices are reviewed and, 
if deemed inappropriate by a trader who has the most knowledge 
of a particular market, can be adjusted. Securities measured with 
these internal valuation techniques are generally classified as 
Level 2 of the hierarchy and often involve using quoted market 
prices for similar securities, pricing models, discounted cash 
flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market 
where available or a combination of multiple valuation 
techniques. Examples include certain residential and 
commercial MBS, municipal bonds, U.S. government and agency 
MBS, and corporate debt securities. Security fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited activity or a 
less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. Such measurements include securities valued using 
internal models or a combination of multiple valuation 
techniques, such as weighting of internal models and vendor pricing, where the unobservable inputs are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Securities classified as Level 3 
include certain residential and commercial MBS, other asset-
backed securities, CDOs and certain CLOs, and certain residual 
and retained interests in residential mortgage loan 212 €€€€securitizations. We value CDOs using the prices of similar instruments, the pricing of completed or pending third-party 
transactions or the pricing of the underlying collateral within the 
CDO. Where vendor prices are not readily available, we use 
management's best estimate. MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE (MHFS)€We carry most of our residential MHFS portfolio at fair value. Fair value is based on 
quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other 
mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. As necessary, 
these prices are adjusted for typical securitization activities, 
including servicing value, portfolio composition, market 
conditions and liquidity. Most of our MHFS are classified as 
Level 2. For the portion where market pricing data is not 
available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair 
value and, accordingly, classify as Level 3. LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)€LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or market value or at fair value. The fair value of LHFS is 
based on what secondary markets are currently offering for loans 
with similar characteristics. As such, we classify those loans 
subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2. LOANS€For information on how we report the carrying value of loans, including PCI loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies). Although most loans are not recorded at 
fair value on a recurring basis, reverse mortgages are recorded at 
fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we record 
nonrecurring fair value adjustments to loans to reflect partial 
write-downs that are based on the observable market price of the 
loan or current appraised value of the collateral. We provide fair value estimates in this disclosure for loans that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring 
basis. Those estimates differentiate loans based on their 
financial characteristics, such as product classification, loan 
category, pricing features and remaining maturity. Prepayment 
and credit loss estimates are evaluated by product and loan rate. The fair value of commercial loans is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for credit loss 
estimates, using discount rates that are appropriate for loans 
with similar characteristics and remaining maturity. For real 
estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages, we calculate fair 
value by discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for 
prepayment and credit loss estimates, using discount rates based 
on current industry pricing (where readily available) or our own 
estimate of an appropriate discount rate for loans of similar size, 
type, remaining maturity and repricing characteristics. The carrying value of credit card loans, which is adjusted for estimates of credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance 
sheet date, is reported as a reasonable estimate of fair value. For 
all other consumer loans, the fair value is generally calculated by 
discounting the contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayment 
and credit loss estimates, based on the current rates we offer for 
loans with similar characteristics. Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit generate ongoing fees at 
our current pricing levels, which are recognized over the term of 
the commitment period. In situations where the credit quality of 
the counterparty to a commitment has declined, we record an 
allowance. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these 
instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees adjusted for 
the related allowance. Certain letters of credit that are hedged 
with derivative instruments are carried at fair value in trading 
assets or liabilities. For those letters of credit, fair value is calculated based on readily quotable credit default spreads using 
a market risk credit default swap model. DERIVATIVES€Quoted market prices are available and used for our exchange-traded derivatives, such as certain interest rate 
futures and option contracts, which we classify as Level 1. 

the-counter (OTC) markets where quoted market prices are not 
always readily available. Therefore we value most OTC 
derivatives using internal valuation techniques. Valuation 
techniques and inputs to internally-developed models depend on 
the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or 
index upon which the derivative's value is based. Key inputs can 
include yield curves, credit curves, foreign-exchange rates, 
prepayment rates, volatility measurements and correlation of 
such inputs. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid 
market and the model does not require significant judgment, 
such derivatives are typically classified as Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 2 
include generic interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, 
commodity swaps, and certain option and forward contracts. 
When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and 
significant inputs are unobservable, such derivatives are 
classified as Level 3. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 3 
include complex and highly structured derivatives, certain credit 
default swaps, interest rate lock commitments written for our 
mortgage loans that we intend to sell and long dated equity 
options where volatility is not observable. Additionally, 
significant judgments are required when classifying financial 
instruments within the fair value hierarchy, particularly between 
Level 2 and 3, as is the case for certain derivatives. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHT (MSRs) AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERESTS HELD IN SECURITIZATIONS MSRs and certain other interests held in securitizations (e.g., interest-only strips) do not trade in an active market with readily observable 
prices. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a 
valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated 
future net servicing income cash flows. The model incorporates 
assumptions that market participants use in estimating future 
net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of 
prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility), discount 
rates, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and 
foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual 
servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Commercial 
MSRs are carried at lower of cost or market value, and therefore 
can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring 
basis. Changes in the fair value of MSRs occur primarily due to 
the collection/realization of expected cash flows, as well as 
changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. For other interests 
held in securitizations (such as interest-only strips), we use a 
valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. The model incorporates our own estimates of 
assumptions market participants use in determining the fair 
value, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rates, 
defaults and contractual fee income. Interest-only strips are 
recorded as trading assets. Our valuation approach is validated 
by our internal valuation model validation group. Fair value 
measurements of our MSRs and interest-only strips use 
significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, we classify 
them as Level 3.€FORECLOSED ASSETS€Foreclosed assets are carried at net realizable value, which represents fair value less costs to sell. 
Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or 213 € €€€€€€Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
(continued) appraised values of the collateral and, accordingly, we classify foreclosed assets as Level 2. NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS€For certain equity securities that are not publicly traded, we have elected the 
fair value option and we use a market comparable pricing 
technique to estimate their fair value. The remaining 
nonmarketable equity investments include low income housing 
tax credit investments, Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home 
Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, and private equity investments which 
are recorded under the cost or equity method of accounting. We 
estimate fair value to record other-than-temporary impairment 
write-downs on a nonrecurring basis. Additionally, we provide 
fair value estimates in this disclosure for cost method 
investments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring or 
nonrecurring basis. Federal Bank stock carrying values approximate fair value. For the remaining cost or equity method investments for which 
we determine fair value, we estimate the fair value using all 
available information and consider the range of potential inputs 
including discounted cash flow models, transaction prices, 
trading multiples of comparable public companies, and entry 
level multiples. Where appropriate these metrics are adjusted to 
account for comparative differences with public companies, and 
for company-specific issues like liquidity or marketability. For 
investments in private equity funds, we use the NAV provided by 
the fund sponsor as a practical expedient to measure fair value. 
In some cases, such NAVs may require adjustments based on 
certain unobservable inputs. Liabilities DEPOSIT LIABILITIES€Deposit liabilities are carried at historical cost. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, 
such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing 
checking, and market rate and other savings, is equal to the 
amount payable on demand at the measurement date. The fair 
value of other time deposits is calculated based on the 
discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is 
estimated using the rates currently offered for like wholesale 
deposits with similar remaining maturities. SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Short-term financial liabilities are carried at historical cost and include federal funds 
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, 
commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The 
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of 
the relatively short time between the origination of the 
instrument and its expected realization. OTHER LIABILITIES€Other liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding derivative liabilities (see the 
ﬁDerivativesﬂ section for derivative liabilities), primarily include 
short sale liabilities. Short sale liabilities are predominantly 
classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, generally depending upon 
whether the underlying securities have readily obtainable quoted 
prices in active exchange markets. LONG-TERM DEBT€Long-term debt is generally carried at amortized cost. For disclosure, we are required to estimate the 
fair value of long-term debt and generally do so using the 
discounted cash flow method. Contractual cash flows are 
discounted using rates currently offered for new notes with 
similar remaining maturities and, as such, these discount rates 
include our current spread levels.€Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes We generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and 
liabilities by using internally developed models and, to a lesser 
extent, prices obtained from vendors, which predominantly 
consist of third-party pricing services. Our valuation processes 
vary depending on which approach is utilized. INTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS€Our internally developed models primarily use discounted cash flow techniques. Use of 
such techniques requires determining relevant inputs, some of 
which are unobservable. Unobservable inputs are generally 
derived from historic performance of similar assets or 
determined from previous market trades in similar instruments. 
These unobservable inputs usually consist of discount rates, 
default rates, loss severity upon default, volatilities, correlations 
and prepayment rates, which are inherent within our Level 3 
instruments. Such inputs can be correlated to similar portfolios 
with known historic experience or recent trades where particular 
unobservable inputs may be implied, but due to the nature of 
various inputs being reflected within a particular trade, the value 
of each input is considered unobservable. We attempt to 
correlate each unobservable input to historic experience and 
other third-party data where available. Internal valuation models are subject to review prescribed within our model risk management policies and procedures, 
which include model validation. The purpose of model validation 
includes ensuring the model is appropriate for its intended use 
and the appropriate controls exist to help mitigate risk of invalid 
valuations. Model validation assesses the adequacy and 
appropriateness of the model, including reviewing its key 
components, such as inputs, processing components, logic or 
theory, output results and supporting model documentation. 
Validation also includes ensuring significant unobservable 
model inputs are appropriate given observable market 
transactions or other market data within the same or similar 
asset classes. This ensures modeled approaches are appropriate 
given similar product valuation techniques and are in line with 
their intended purpose. We have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and liabilities that use such internal valuation 
models. These procedures, which are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that models continue to perform as 
expected after approved, include: 
Ł ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions 
and other independent market data (including pricing 
vendors, if available); Ł back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized 
transactions; and Ł review of modeled valuation results against expectations, 
including review of significant or unusual value fluctuations. We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, procedures and controls are in place to ensure existing models are subject to 
periodic reviews, and we perform full model revalidations as 
necessary. All internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by business-unit-level management, and all models are subject 
to additional oversight by a corporate-level risk management 
department. Corporate oversight responsibilities include 
evaluating the adequacy of business unit risk management 
programs, maintaining company-wide model validation policies 
and standards and reporting the results of these activities to 
management and our Corporate Model Risk Committee (CMoR). 
The CMoR consists of senior executive management and reports 214 on top model risk issues to the Company™s Risk Committee of the Board. VENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS€In certain limited circumstances we obtain pricing from third-party vendors for the 
value of our Level 3 assets or liabilities. We have processes in 
place to approve such vendors to ensure information obtained 
and valuation techniques used are appropriate. Once these 
vendors are approved to provide pricing information, we 
monitor and review the results to ensure the fair values are 
reasonable and in line with market experience in similar asset 
classes. While the input amounts used by the pricing vendor in 
determining fair value are not provided, and therefore 
unavailable for our review, we do perform one or more of the 
following procedures to validate the prices received: 
Ł comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); Ł variance analysis of prices; Ł corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent 
market data, such as market transactions and relevant 
benchmark indices; Ł review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with 
market liquidity and other market-related conditions; and Ł 
instrument basis. Fair Value Measurements from Vendors For certain assets and liabilities, we obtain fair value 
measurements from vendors, which predominantly consist of 
third-party pricing services, and record the unadjusted fair value 
in our financial statements. For instruments where we utilize 
vendor prices to record the price of an instrument, we perform 
additional procedures. We evaluate pricing vendors by 
comparing prices from one vendor to prices of other vendors for 
identical or similar instruments and evaluate the consistency of 
prices to known market transactions when determining the level 
of reliance to place on a particular pricing vendor. 
Methodologies employed, controls in place and inputs used by 
third-party pricing vendors are subject to additional review 
when such services are provided. This review may consist of, in 
part, obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing 
methodology materials distributed. The fair value measurements provided by brokers or third-party pricing services, and not adjusted by us, are shown by fair 
value hierarchy level in the table below. Fair value 
measurements obtained from brokers or third-party pricing 
services that we have adjusted to determine the fair value 
recorded in our financial statements are not included in the 
following table. Brokers€Third-party pricing services€(in millions) Level 1€Level 2€Level 3€Level 1€Level 2€Level 3€December 31, 2014 Trading assets (excluding derivatives)

217 €Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
(continued) Changes in Fair Value Levels We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the 
fair value hierarchy and transfer between Level 1, Level 2, and 
Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not 
limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in 
economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive 
changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in availability of observable market data, which also may result in 
changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of 
transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Transfers into and out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 for the periods presented are provided within the following table. The 
amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the 
beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Transfers Between Fair Value Levels Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (1)(in millions) In Out In Out In Out TotalYear ended December 31, 2014Trading assets (excluding derivatives) $ Š (11) 70 (31) 31 (59) ŠAvailable-for-sale securities Š (8) 370 (148)

transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 due to a decrease in observable market data. 
(3) Consists of $231 million of collateralized loan obligations classified as trading assets and $12.5 billion classified as available-for-sale securities that we transferred from 

Level 3 to Level 2 in 2013 as a result of increased observable market data in the valuation of such instruments. 
(4) Transfers out of available-for-sale securities classified as Level 3 exclude $6.0 billion in asset-backed securities that were transferred from the available-for-sale portfolio to 

held-to-maturity securities. 
(5) Includes $9.4 billion of securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions that we transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 as a result of increased observable market data in the 

valuation of such instruments. This transfer was done in conjunction with a change in our valuation technique from an internal model based upon unobservable inputs to 

third-party vendor pricing based upon market observable data. 
(6) Consists of reverse mortgage loans securitized with GNMA which were accounted for as secured borrowing transactions. We transferred the loans from Level 2 to Level 3 

due to decreased market activity and visibility to significant trades of the same or similar products. As a result, we changed our valuation technique from an internal model 

based on market observable data to an internal discounted cash flow model based on unobservable inputs.€

246 38The following table provides quantitative information about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of substantially all of our Level 3 assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which 
we use an internal model. The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and liabilities that are valued using fair values obtained from third-
party vendors are not included in the table as the specific inputs 
applied are not provided by the vendor (see discussion regarding 
vendor-developed valuations within the ﬁLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processesﬂ section previously within this 
Note). In addition, the table excludes the valuation techniques 
and significant unobservable inputs for certain classes of Level 3 
assets and liabilities measured using an internal model that we 
consider, both individually and in the aggregate, insignificant 
relative to our overall Level 3 assets and liabilities. We made this 
determination based upon an evaluation of each class which 
considered the magnitude of the positions, nature of the 
unobservable inputs and potential for significant changes in fair 
value due to changes in those inputs. 224 ($ in millions, except cost to service amounts) Fair Value Level 3 Valuation Technique(s) Significant Unobservable Input Range of Inputs€Weighted Average (1) December 31, 2014 Trading and available-for-sale securities: Securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions: Government, healthcare and other revenue bonds $ 1,900 Discounted cash flow Discount rate 0.4 -5.6 %

(4) Consists primarily of investments in asset-backed securities that are revolving in nature, in which the timing of advances and repayments of principal are uncertain. 
(5) Consists of auction rate preferred equity securities with no maturity date that are callable by the issuer. 
(6) Consists predominantly of reverse mortgage loans securitized with GNMA which were accounted for as secured borrowing transactions. 
(7) The high end of the range of inputs is for servicing modified loans. For non-modified loans the range is $86 - $270. 
(8) Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of 

borrower behavior.

226 €€€The valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets and liabilities, as presented in the previous tables, are described as follows:€
Ł Discounted cash flow - Discounted cash flow valuation 

techniques generally consist of developing an estimate of 
future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of 
an instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a 
rate of return that results in the fair value amount. Ł Option model - Option model valuation techniques are 

generally used for instruments in which the holder has a 
contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a 
future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going 
above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models 
estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by 
incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price 
of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. Ł Market comparable pricing - Market comparable pricing 

valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of 
certain instruments by incorporating known inputs such as 
recent transaction prices, pending transactions, or prices of 
other similar investments which require significant 
adjustment to reflect differences in instrument 
characteristics. Ł Vendor-priced€- Prices obtained from third-party pricing 
vendors or brokers that are used to record the fair value of 
the asset or liability, of which the related valuation 
technique and significant unobservable inputs are not 
provided. Significant unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be 
significant, if by their exclusion, the fair value of the Level 3 asset 
or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage 
change or based on qualitative factors, such as nature of the 
instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the 
significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs 
used within the valuation. Following is a description of the 
significant unobservable inputs provided in the tables. Ł Comparability adjustment - is an adjustment made to observed market data, such as a transaction price in order to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, 
or other factors used within a market valuation approach 
expressed as a percentage of an observed price. Ł Conversion Factor - is the risk-adjusted rate in which a 
particular instrument may be exchanged for another 
instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage 
change from a specified rate. Ł Correlation factor - is the likelihood of one instrument 
changing in price relative to another based on an 
established relationship expressed as a percentage of 
relative change in price over a period over time. Ł Cost to service - is the expected cost per loan of servicing a portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for 
unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and 
foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing 
such loan portfolios. Ł Credit spread - is the portion of the interest rate in excess of a benchmark interest rate, such as OIS, LIBOR or U.S. 
Treasury rates, that when applied to an investment captures 
changes in the obligor™s creditworthiness. Ł Default rate - is an estimate of the likelihood of not collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a 
constant default rate (CDR). Ł Discount rate - is a rate of return used to present value the 

future expected cash flow to arrive at the fair value of an 
instrument. The discount rate consists of a benchmark rate 
component and a risk premium component. The benchmark 
rate component, for example, OIS, LIBOR or U.S. Treasury 
rates, is generally observable within the market and is 
necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. 
The risk premium component reflects the amount of 
compensation market participants require due to the 
uncertainty inherent in the instruments™ cash flows resulting 
from risks such as credit and liquidity. Ł Fall-out factor - is the expected percentage of loans 

associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio 
that are likely of not funding. Ł Initial-value servicing - is the estimated value of the 
underlying loan, including the value attributable to the 
embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of 
outstanding unpaid principal balance. Ł Loss severity Œ is the percentage of contractual cash flows 
lost in the event of a default. Ł Prepayment rate - is the estimated rate at which forecasted 

prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt 
instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant 
prepayment rate (CPR). Ł Utilization rate - is the estimated rate in which incremental 

portions of existing reverse mortgage credit lines are 
expected to be drawn by borrowers expressed as an 
annualized rate. Ł Volatility factor - is the extent of change in price an item is 

estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time 
expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a 
period over time. Ł Weighted average life - is the weighted average number of 

years an investment is expected to remain outstanding, 
based on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated 
date the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the 
instrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing 
of an instrument™s cash flows whose timing is not 
contractually fixed. 227 €€€€€Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
(continued) Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity We generally use discounted cash flow or similar internal 
modeling techniques to determine the fair value of our Level 3 
assets and liabilities. Use of these techniques requires 
determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of 
which represent significant unobservable inputs as indicated in 
the preceding tables. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable 
inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the 
instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the 
fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction 
for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are 
used within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a 
change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an 
opposite change in another input having a potentially muted 
impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument. 
Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a 
change to another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain 
inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or 
magnify the fair value impact. SECURITIES, LOANS, MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE and NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS€The fair values of predominantly all Level 3 trading securities, mortgages held for sale, loans, other nonmarketable equity investments, and 
available-for-sale securities have consistent inputs, valuation 
techniques and correlation to changes in underlying inputs. The 
internal models used to determine fair value for these Level 3 
instruments use certain significant unobservable inputs within a 
discounted cash flow or market comparable pricing valuation 
technique. Such inputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, 
default rate, loss severity, utilization rate, comparability 
adjustment and weighted average life. These Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value based upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate, 
loss severity, or weighted average life inputs. Conversely, the fair 
value of these Level 3 assets would generally increase (decrease) 
in value if the prepayment rate input were to increase (decrease) 
or if the utilization rate input were to increase (decrease). Generally, a change in the assumption used for default rate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the risk 
premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the 
portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change 
in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable 
inputs for loss severity, utilization rate and weighted average life 
do not increase or decrease based on movements in the other 
significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 assets. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Level 3 derivative instruments are valued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and 
discounted cash flow valuation techniques. We utilize certain 
unobservable inputs within these techniques to determine the 
fair value of the Level 3 derivative instruments. The significant 
unobservable inputs consist of credit spread, a comparability 
adjustment, prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-
value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average 
life, conversion factor, and correlation factor. Level 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the underlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase 
(decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, credit spread, 
conversion factor, or loss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 
derivative assets (liabilities) would increase (decrease) in value 
upon an increase (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value 
servicing, weighted average life, or volatility factor inputs. The 
inverse of the above relationships would occur for instruments in 
which we are short the underlying. The correlation factor and 
comparability adjustment inputs may have a positive or negative 
impact on the fair value of these derivative instruments 
depending on the change in value of the item the correlation 
factor and comparability adjustment is referencing. The 
correlation factor and comparability adjustment is considered 
independent from movements in other significant unobservable 
inputs for derivative instruments. Generally, for derivative instruments for which we are subject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced 
instrument, change in the assumption used for default rate is 
accompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium 
component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related 
to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the 
assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for 
loss severity, fall-out factor, initial-value servicing, weighted 
average life, conversion factor, and volatility do not increase or 
decrease based on movements in other significant unobservable 
inputs for these Level 3 instruments. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS We use a discounted cash flow valuation technique to determine the fair value of Level 3 
mortgage servicing rights. These models utilize certain 
significant unobservable inputs including prepayment rate, 
discount rate and costs to service. An increase in any of these 
unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the mortgage 
servicing rights and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these 
inputs would result in the mortgage servicing rights increasing in 
value. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the default 
rate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the 
assumption used for cost to service and a directionally opposite 
change in the assumption used for prepayment. The sensitivity 
of our residential MSRs is discussed further in Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities). 228 €€Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a assets.

liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for 
which we use an internal model. We have excluded from the table classes of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured using an internal model that we 
consider, both individually and in the aggregate, insignificant relative to our overall Level 3 nonrecurring measurements. We 
made this determination based upon an evaluation of each class,

$108 million and $88 million at December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013 respectively. 
Offshore funds primarily invest in foreign mutual funds. Redemption restrictions are in place for these investments with a 
fair value of $24 million and $144 million at December 31, 2014 
and December 31,2013, respectively, due to lock-up provisions 
that will remain in effect until February 2017. Private equity funds invest in equity and debt securities issued by private and publicly-held companies in connection 
with leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations and expansion 
opportunities. These investments do not allow redemptions. 
Alternatively, we receive distributions as the underlying assets of 
the funds liquidate, which we expect to occur over the next 
6€years. Venture capital funds invest in domestic and foreign companies in a variety of industries, including information 
technology, financial services and healthcare. These investments 
can never be redeemed with the funds. Instead, we receive 
distributions as the underlying assets of the fund liquidate, 
which we expect to occur over the next 5 years. 
231   Note 17: Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
(continued) Fair Value Option The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or 
liabilities, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the 
fair value option to align the measurement model with how the 
financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce 
complexity or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion 
of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. TRADING ASSETS - LOANS We engage in holding loans for market-making purposes to support the buying and selling 
demands of our customers. These loans are generally held for a 
short period of time and managed within parameters of 
internally approved market risk limits. We have elected to 
measure and carry them at fair value, which best aligns with our 
risk management practices. Fair value for these loans is 
primarily determined using readily available market data based 
on recent transaction prices for similar loans. MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE (MHFS) We measure MHFS at fair value for MHFS originations for which an active secondary 
market and readily available market prices exist to reliably 
support fair value pricing models used for these loans. Loan 
origination fees on these loans are recorded when earned, and 
related€direct loan origination costs are recognized when 
incurred. We also measure at fair value certain of our other 
interests held related to residential loan sales and 
securitizations. We believe fair value measurement for MHFS 
and other interests held, which we hedge with economic hedge 
derivatives along with our MSRs measured at fair value, reduces 
certain timing differences and better matches changes in the 
value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives 
used as economic hedges for these assets. LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS) We elected to measure certain LHFS portfolios at fair value in conjunction with customer 
accommodation activities, which better aligns the measurement 
basis of the assets held with our management objectives given 
the trading nature of these portfolios. LOANS Loans that we measure at fair value consist predominantly of reverse mortgage loans previously transferred 
under a GNMA reverse mortgage securitization program 
accounted for as a secured borrowing. Before the transfer, they 
were classified as MHFS measured at fair value and, as such, 
remain carried on our balance sheet under the fair value option. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We elected to measure at fair value certain letters of credit and nonmarketable equity 
securities that are hedged with derivative instruments to better 
reflect the economics of the transactions. The letters of credit are 
included in trading account assets or liabilities, and the 
nonmarketable equity securities are included in other assets. Similarly, we may elect fair value option for the assets and liabilities of certain consolidated VIEs. This option is generally 
elected for newly consolidated VIEs for which predominantly all 
of our interests, prior to consolidation, are carried at fair value 
with changes in fair value recorded to earnings. Accordingly, 
such an election allows us to continue fair value accounting 
through earnings for those interests and eliminate income 
statement mismatch otherwise caused by differences in the 
measurement basis of the consolidated VIEs assets and 
liabilities. The following table reflects differences between the fair value carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities for which 
we have elected the fair value option and the contractual 
aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity.

nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to

of the Wells€Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). 
Dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock are cumulative from the 
date of initial issuance and are payable quarterly at annual rates 
based upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred 
Stock released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan is 
converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated 
value of the ESOP Preferred Stock and the then current market price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also 
convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP 
Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption 
price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus

At December€31, 2014, we have warrants outstanding and 
exercisable to purchase 38,424,434 shares of our common stock 

with an exercise price of $33.996 per share, expiring on October 

28, 2018. We did not purchase any of these warrants in 2014 or 

2013. Warrants to purchase 684,430 and 435 shares of our 

common stock were exercised in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
These warrants were issued in connection with our participation 
in the TARP CPP.€Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock 
Purchase Plans Participants in our dividend reinvestment and common stock 
direct purchase plans may purchase shares of our common stock 
at fair market value by reinvesting dividends and/or making 
optional cash payments, under the plan's terms. Employee Stock Plans We offer stock-based employee compensation plans as described 
below. For information on our accounting for stock-based 
compensation plans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies). LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS€Our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP) provides for awards 
of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation 
rights, restricted shares, restricted stock rights (RSRs), 
performance share awards (PSAs), performance units and stock 
awards with or without restrictions. Beginning in 2010, we granted RSRs and performance shares as our primary long-term incentive awards instead of 
stock options. Holders of RSRs are entitled to the related shares 
of common stock at no cost generally vesting over three to five 

years after the RSRs were granted. RSRs generally continue to 
vest after retirement according to the original vesting schedule. 
Except in limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment ends. Holders of each vested PSA are entitled to the related shares of common stock at no cost. PSAs continue to vest after retirement according to the original vesting schedule subject to 
satisfying the performance criteria and other vesting conditions. Holders of RSRs and PSAs may be entitled to receive additional RSRs and PSAs (dividend equivalents) or cash 
payments equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid 
had the RSRs or PSAs been issued and outstanding shares of 
common stock. RSRs and PSAs granted as dividend equivalents 
are subject to the same vesting schedule and conditions as the 
underlying award. Stock options must have an exercise price at or above fair market value (as defined in the plan) of the stock at the date of 
grant (except for substitute or replacement options granted in 
connection with mergers or other acquisitions) and a term of no 
more than 10 years. Except for options granted in 2004 and 

2005, which generally vested in full upon grant, options 
generally become exercisable over three years beginning on the 

first anniversary of the date of grant. Except as otherwise 
permitted under the plan, if employment is ended for reasons 
other than retirement, permanent disability or death, the option 
exercise period is reduced or the options are canceled. Compensation expense for most of our RSRs, and PSAs granted prior to 2013, is based on the quoted market price of the 
related stock at the grant date; beginning in 2013 certain RSRs 
and all PSAs granted include discretionary performance based 
vesting conditions and are subject to variable accounting. For 
these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates 
with changes in our stock price. Stock option expense is based on 
the fair value of the awards at the date of grant. The following 
table summarizes the major components of stock incentive 
compensation expense and the related recognized tax benefit.

companies into stock options to purchase our common stock 
based on the terms of the original stock option plan and the 
agreed-upon exchange ratio. In addition, we converted restricted 
stock awards into awards that entitle holders to our stock after 
the vesting conditions are met. Holders receive cash dividends 
on outstanding awards if provided in the original award. The total number of shares of common stock available for grant under the plans at December€31, 2014, was 245 million. 
238  €€ Director Awards Beginning in 2011, we granted only common stock awards under the LTICP to non-employee directors elected or re-elected at the 
annual meeting of stockholders and prorated awards to directors 
who join the Board at any other time. Stock awards vest 
immediately. Options also were granted to directors prior to 
2011, and can be exercised after twelve months through the tenth 

anniversary of the grant date. Options granted prior to 2005 may 
include the right to acquire a ﬁreloadﬂ stock option. Reload 
grants are fully vested upon grant and are expensed 
immediately. The last reload options were granted in 2013. As of 
December 31, 2014, none of the options outstanding included a 
reload feature. Restricted Share Rights A summary of the status of our RSRs and restricted share awards

At December€31, 2014, there was $708 million of total 
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSRs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period 
of 2.5 years. The total fair value of RSRs that vested during 2014, 

2013 and 2012 was $1.0 billion, $472 million and $89 million, 

respectively. Performance Share Awards Holders of PSAs are entitled to the related shares of common 
stock at no cost subject to the Company's achievement of 
specified performance criteria over a three-year period. PSAs are 

granted at a target number; based on the Company's 
performance, the number of awards that vest can be adjusted 
downward to zero and upward to a maximum of either 125% or 

150% of target. The awards vest in the quarter after the end of 
the performance period. For PSAs whose performance period 
ended December€31, 2014, the determination of the number of 

performance shares that will vest will occur in the first quarter of 
2015, after review of the Company™s performance by the Human 

Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. Beginning in 
2013, PSAs granted include discretionary performance based 
vesting conditions and are subject to variable accounting. For 
these awards, the associated compensation expense fluctuates 
with changes in our stock price and the estimated outcome of 
meeting the performance conditions. The total expense that will 
be recognized on these awards cannot be finalized until the 
determination of the awards that will vest. A summary of the status of our PSAs at December€31, 2014

$805€million, $643 million and $694 million, respectively. Cash received from the exercise of stock options for 2014, 
2013 and 2012 was $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, 

respectively. We do not have a specific policy on repurchasing shares to satisfy share option exercises. Rather, we have a general policy 
on repurchasing shares to meet common stock issuance 
requirements for our benefit plans (including share option 
exercises), conversion of our convertible securities, acquisitions 
and other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the 
amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our 
capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for 
acquisitions and employee benefit plans, market conditions 
(including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and 
legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and 
there can be no assurance as to the number of shares we will 
repurchase or when we will repurchase them. The fair value of each option award granted on or after January 1, 2006, is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation 
model. The expected term of reload options granted is generally 
based on the midpoint between the valuation date and the 
contractual termination date of the original option. Our expected 
volatilities are based on a combination of the historical volatility 
of our common stock and implied volatilities for traded options 
on our common stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. 
Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
Both expected volatility and the risk-free rates are based on a 
period commensurate with our expected term. The expected 
dividend is based on a fixed dividend amount. The following table presents the weighted-average per share fair value of options granted and the assumptions used, based on 
a Black-Scholes option valuation model. All of the options 
granted in 2013 and 2012 resulted from the reload feature.

defined contribution plan with an Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan (ESOP) feature. The ESOP feature enables the 401(k) Plan 
to borrow money to purchase our preferred or common stock. 
From 1994 through 2014, with the exception of 2009, we loaned 
money to the 401(k) Plan to purchase shares of our ESOP 
preferred stock. As our employer contributions are made to the 
401(k) Plan and are used by the 401(k) Plan to make ESOP loan 
payments, the ESOP preferred stock in the 401(k) Plan is 
released and converted into our common stock shares. 
Dividends on the common stock shares allocated as a result of 
the release and conversion of the ESOP preferred stock reduce 
retained earnings and the shares are considered outstanding for 
computing earnings per share. Dividends on the unallocated 
ESOP preferred stock do not reduce retained earnings, and the 
shares are not considered to be common stock equivalents for 
computing earnings per share. Loan principal and interest 
payments are made from our employer contributions to the 401 
(k) Plan, along with dividends paid on the ESOP preferred stock. 
With each principal and interest payment, a portion of the ESOP 
preferred stock is released and converted to common stock 
shares, which are allocated to the 401(k) Plan participants and 
invested in the Wells Fargo ESOP Fund within the 401(k) Plan. 240 The balance of common stock and unreleased preferred shares of common stock and unreleased ESOP Preferred Stock stock held in the Wells Fargo ESOP fund, the fair value of paid to the 401(k) Plan were: unreleased ESOP preferred stock and the dividends on allocated Shares outstanding December 31, (in millions, except shares) 2014 2013 2012 Allocated shares (common) 136,801,782 137,354,139 136,821,035 Unreleased shares (preferred) 1,251,287 1,105,664 910,934 Fair value of unreleased ESOP preferred shares $ 1,251 1,105 911 Dividends paid Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Allocated shares (common) $ 186 159 117 Unreleased shares (preferred) 152 132 115 Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Sales Agents WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Parent formed solely to sponsor a deferred 
compensation plan for independent sales agents who provide 
investment, financial and other qualifying services for or with 
respect to participating affiliates. The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Contractors, which became effective 
January€1,€2002, allowed participants to defer all or part of their 
eligible compensation payable to them by a participating 
affiliate. The Parent has fully and unconditionally guaranteed 
the deferred compensation obligations of WF Deferred 
Compensation Holdings, Inc. under the plan. No future deferrals 
may be made under this plan and participants may no longer 
reallocate their existing account balances under the plan among 
different investment options. 241 Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses 
Pension and Postretirement Plans We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan called the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance 
Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of 
Wells Fargo. The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009 
and no new benefits accrue after that date. Prior to July 1, 2009, eligible employees' Cash Balance Plan accounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a percentage of their certified compensation; the freeze discontinued the allocation of compensation credits after June 30, 2009. Investment credits continue to be allocated to 
participants based on their accumulated balances. We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan based on an assessment of whether our estimated lump sum 
payments related to the Cash Balance Plan will, in aggregate for 
the year, exceed the sum of its annual service and interest cost 
(threshold). Lump sum payments did not exceed this threshold 
in 2014. In 2013, lump sum payments exceeded this threshold. 
Settlement losses of $123 million were recognized in 2013, 

representing the pro rata portion of the net loss remaining in 
cumulative other comprehensive income based on the 
percentage reduction in the Cash Balance Plan™s projected 
benefit obligation. A remeasurement of the Cash Balance liability 
and related plan assets occurs at the end of each quarter in 
which settlement losses are recognized. We did not make a contribution to our Cash Balance Plan in 2014. We do not expect that we will be required to make a contribution to the Cash Balance Plan in 2015; however, this is 
dependent on the finalization of the actuarial valuation in 2015. 
Our decision of whether to make a contribution in 2015 will be 
based on various factors including the actual investment 
performance of plan assets during 2015. Given these 
uncertainties, we cannot estimate at this time the amount, if any, 
that we will contribute in 2015 to the Cash Balance Plan. For the 
nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, 
there is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount 
needed to fund benefit payments; we may contribute more to our 
postretirement benefit plans dependent on various factors. We provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees and reserve the right to terminate, 
modify or amend any of the benefits at any time. The information set forth in the following tables is based on current actuarial reports using the measurement date of 
December 31 for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. 
In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) published 
updated mortality tables that reflect improved longevity. The 
benefit obligations at December 31, 2014 reflect the SOA's 
updated mortality tables, which did not have a material effect on 
these obligations. The changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized on

To account for postretirement health care plans we use health care cost trend rates to recognize the effect of expected 
changes in future health care costs due to medical inflation, 
utilization changes, new technology, regulatory requirements 
and Medicare cost shifting. In determining the end of year 
benefit obligation we assume an average annual increase of 
approximately 7.00%, for health care costs in 2015. This rate is 

assumed to trend down 0.25% per year until the trend rate 
reaches an ultimate rate of 5.00% in 2023. The 2014 periodic 

benefit cost was determined using an initial annual trend rate of 
7.25%. This rate was assumed to decrease 0.25% per year until 

the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of 5.00% in 2023. 

Increasing the assumed health care trend by one percentage 
point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of 
December€31,€2014, by $45 million and the total of the interest 
cost and service cost components of the net periodic benefit cost 
for 2014 by $2 million. Decreasing the assumed health care 
trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the 
benefit obligation as of December€31,€2014, by $40 million and 

the total of the interest cost and service cost components of the 
net periodic benefit cost for 2014 by $2 million.€
Investment Strategy and Asset Allocation We seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a 
prudent level of risk given the benefit obligations of the pension 
plans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is 
designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with long-term 
growth opportunities while ensuring that risk is mitigated 
through diversification across numerous asset classes and 
various investment strategies. We target the asset allocation for 
our Cash Balance Plan at a target mix range of 30% -50% 

equities, 40% -60% fixed income, and approximately 10% in real 

estate, venture capital, private equity and other investments. The 
Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes 
several members of senior management, formally reviews the 
investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a 
quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/ 
liability evaluations are also conducted. Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) trust, which are invested with a target mix of 40%-60% for both 
equities and fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree 
Medical Plan Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association 
(VEBA) trust, which are invested with a general target asset mix 
of 20%-40% equities and 60%-80% fixed income. In addition, 

the strategy for the VEBA trust assets considers the effect of 
income taxes by utilizing a combination of variable annuity and 
low turnover investment strategies. Members of the EBRC 
formally review the investment risk and performance of these 
assets on a quarterly basis. Projected Benefit Payments Future benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and 
other benefit plans are presented in the following table. Other 
benefits payments are expected to be reduced by prescription 
drug subsidies from the federal government provided by the

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES€Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. Cash and Cash Equivalents Œ includes investments in collective investment funds valued at fair value based upon the quoted 
market values of the underlying net assets. The unit price is 
quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the unit 
price is based on underlying investments traded on an active 
market. This group of assets also includes investments in 
registered investment companies valued at the NAV of shares 
held at year end. Long Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, and International Fixed Income Œ includes investments traded on 
the secondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted 
market prices for similar securities, pricing models, and 
discounted cash flow analyses using significant inputs 
observable in the market where available, or a combination of 
multiple valuation techniques. This group of assets also includes 
highly liquid government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, 
limited partnerships valued at the NAV provided by the fund 
sponsor and registered investment companies and collective 
investment funds described above. Domestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks Œ investments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at quoted market values. This group of assets also includes 
investments in registered investment companies and collective 
investment funds described above. Real Estate and Timber Œ the fair value of real estate and timber is estimated based primarily on appraisals prepared by third-
party appraisers. Market values are estimates and the actual 
market price of the real estate can only be determined by 
negotiation between independent third parties in a sales 
transaction. This group of assets also includes investments in 
exchange-traded equity securities described above. Hedge Funds and Private Equity Œ the fair values of hedge funds are valued based on the proportionate share of the underlying 
net assets of the investment funds that comprise the fund, based 
on valuations supplied by the underlying investment funds. 
Investments in private equity funds are valued at the NAV 
provided by the fund sponsor. Market values are estimates and 
the actual market price of the investments can only be 
determined by negotiation between independent third parties in 
a sales transaction. Other Œ insurance contracts that are generally stated at cash surrender value. This group of assets also includes investments 
in collective investment funds and private equity described 
above. 246 €€The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation 
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market 
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions 
to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could 
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting 
date. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan named the 
Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). Under the 
401(k) Plan, after one month of service, eligible employees may 
contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, subject to 

statutory limits. Eligible employees who complete one year of 

service are eligible for company matching contributions, which 
are generally dollar for dollar up to 6% of an employee's eligible 

certified compensation. Effective January 1, 2010, matching 
contributions are 100% vested. The 401(k) Plan includes an 

employer discretionary profit sharing contribution feature to 
allow us to make a contribution to eligible employees™ 401(k) 
Plan accounts. Eligible employees who complete one year of 

service are eligible for profit sharing contributions. Profit 
sharing contributions are vested after three years of service. 

Total defined contribution retirement plan expenses were $1.1 

billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012 

respectively. Other Expenses Expenses exceeding 1% of total interest income and noninterest

plan adjustments are recorded in cumulative OCI (see Note 23 
(Other Comprehensive Income)). These associated adjustments 
decreased OCI by $1.3 billion in 2014. 
We have determined that a valuation reserve is required for 2014 in the amount of $426 million predominantly attributable 

to deferred tax assets in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
where we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax 
assets will not be realized. In these jurisdictions, carry back 
limitations, lack of sources of taxable income, and tax planning 
strategy limitations contributed to our conclusion that the 
deferred tax assets would not be realizable. We have concluded 
that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax 
assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources 
of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to 
implement tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carry forwards with related deferred tax assets of $631 million. If these 

carry forwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying 
amounts through 2034. 
At December 31, 2014, we had undistributed foreign earnings of $1.8 billion related to foreign subsidiaries. We intend 

to reinvest these earnings indefinitely outside the U.S. and 
accordingly have not provided $513 million of income tax 

liability on these earnings. The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax expense and rate to the effective income tax expense and 
rate. Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax 
expense by income before income tax expense less the net 
income from noncontrolling interests. 248 €December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Statutory federal income tax expense and rate Change in tax rate resulting from: State and local taxes on income, net of federal income tax benefit Tax-exempt interest

The effective tax rate for 2014, includes a net reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions primarily due to the resolution of prior period matters with state taxing authorities. 
The effective tax rate for 2013, included a net reduction in the 
reserve for uncertain tax positions primarily due to settlements 
with authorities regarding certain cross border transactions and 
tax benefits recognized from the realization for tax purposes of a 
previously written down investment. The 2012 effective tax rate 
included a tax benefit resulting from the surrender of previously 
written-down Wachovia life insurance investments. The change in unrecognized tax benefits follows: Year ended€

Balance at end of year $ 5,002 5,528 Of the $5.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits at 
December€31, 2014, approximately $3.1 billion would, if 
recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The remaining $1.9€billion of unrecognized tax benefits relates to income tax 
positions on temporary differences. We recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have accrued approximately $660 million and $832 million for the 

payment of interest and penalties, respectively. In 2014, we 
recognized in income tax expense, a net tax benefit related to 
interest and penalties of $142 million. In 2013, we recognized in 

income tax expense, interest and penalties of $69 million. 
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely 
examined by tax authorities in these various jurisdictions. The 
IRS is currently examining the 2007 through 2012 consolidated 
federal income tax returns of Wells Fargo & Company and its 
subsidiaries. In addition, we are currently subject to examination 
by various state, local and foreign taxing authorities. With few 
exceptions, Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries are not subject to 
federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations for 
taxable years prior to 2007. Wachovia Corporation and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to federal examination and, with limited exception, are no longer subject to state, local and foreign income tax examinations. We are litigating or appealing various issues related to our prior IRS examinations for the periods 2003 through 2006, and 
we are appealing various issues related to IRS examinations of 
Wachovia™s 2006 through 2008 tax years. We have paid the IRS 
the contested income tax and interest associated with these 
issues and refund claims have been filed for the respective years. 
During 2014 we filed a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, which was denied, in connection with a lease 
restructuring transaction. It is possible that one or more of these 
examinations, appeals or litigation may be resolved within the 
next twelve months resulting in a decrease of up to $700 million 

to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. 249 Note 22: Earnings Per Common Share

The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by 
federal bank regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve 
establishes capital requirements, including well capitalized 
standards, for the consolidated financial holding company, and 
the OCC has similar requirements for the Company™s national 
banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). The following table presents regulatory capital information for Wells Fargo & Company and the Bank. Information 
presented for December 31, 2014, reflects the transition to Basel 
III capital requirements from previous regulatory capital 
adequacy guidelines under Basel I effective in 2013. Among 
other matters, Basel III revises the definition of capital, and 
changes are being phased-in effective January 1, 2014, through 
the end of 2021, with regulatory capital ratios determined using 
Basel III (General Approach) risk-weighted assets during 2014. 
Under the Basel III (General Approach), at December 31, 2014, 
the Company™s Common Equity Tier 1 capital was $137.1 billion, 

or 11.04% of risk-weighted assets, and the Bank™s Common 

Equity Tier 1 capital was $119.9 billion, or 10.49% of risk-

weighted assets. We do not consolidate our wholly-owned trust (the Trust) formed solely to issue trust preferred and preferred purchase 
securities (the Securities). Securities issued by the Trust 
includable in Tier 2 capital were $2.1 billion at 

December€31,€2014. Under the new Basel III capital 
requirements, our remaining trust preferred and preferred 
purchase securities will begin amortizing in 2016 and will no 
longer count as Tier 2 capital in 2022. The Bank is an approved seller/servicer of mortgage loans and is required to maintain minimum levels of shareholders™ 
equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, 
FHLMC and FNMA. At December 31, 2014, the Bank met these 
requirements. Other subsidiaries, including the Company™s 
insurance and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are also subject to 
various minimum capital levels, as defined by applicable 
industry regulations.€The minimum capital levels for these 
subsidiaries, and related restrictions, are not significant to our 
consolidated operations.

3% for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings, effective 

management and monitoring of market risk and, in general, are considered top-rated, strong banking organizations.

€€Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm€The Board of Directors and Stockholders Wells€Fargo & Company: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells€Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash 
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Œ Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February€25,€2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting. San Francisco, California

˜˚˛ IBCRelationships. Teamwork. Values. At 
Wellargo, we are about building lifelong 

relationships one customer at a time. We 

work hard for each and every customer 

because we care about theinancial success

and want to be with them every step of the

way. We have been around for a long time and

we will be there for our customers for many 

years to come. And we know that who we 

are is as important as what we do. Because 

at Wellargo, culture counts.
After several failed attempts, long-time
trucker Frank Guzman resolved to start

his own hauling business lae

thie fueled bancing and 

guidance from Wellargo. And that 

has made all therence.
ﬁI™ve worked and driven for many 
companies in my life,ﬂ he said. ﬁBs 

clear that for me, being an owner-

operator is more rewarding.ﬂ
Frank secured a Wellargo 
Equipment Express
® loan to help buy 

his rig. He also received guidance from 

small business bankers on managing 

his startup company™ances. The 

Houston-area entrepreneur then 

landed a client in the energy sector.
ﬁIt™s the team approach that makes 
all of this work,ﬂ said Frank, whose 

ancée, Chrisy Guillory, is his business

partner ananciaer. Frank 

credits Wellargo for helping him 

ancing and money-management

advice. ﬁWellargo has been there to

help every step along thay,ﬂ he said.
ﬁAll of this started when he came 
one day and spoke with our business 

lending specialist,ﬂ said Trena Small, 

manager of the Wellargo store in 

Pearland, Texas, where Frank banks. 

ﬁWe helped him create a busin

omething that helps a lot of 

customers grow their business. And it 

has helped him tremendously.ﬂ
