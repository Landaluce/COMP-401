25  This Annual Report, including the Financial Review and the Fina
ncial Statements and related No
tes, contains forward-looking 
statements, which may include forecasts of our financial results 
and condition, expectations fo
r our operations and business, a
nd our 
assumptions for those forecasts and expectat
ions. Do not unduly rely on forward-look
ing statements. Actual results may differ 
materially from our forward-looking statemen
ts due to several factors. Factors that 
could cause our actual results to differ ma

 Financial Review 
 Overview  Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services 
company with $1.3 trillion in assets. Founded in 1852 and 

headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, insurance, 
trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, 
retail banking, brokerage servic
es and consumer and commercial 
finance through more than 9,
000 stores, 12,000 ATMs, the 
internet and other distribution channels to individuals, 
businesses and institutions across North America and 
internationally. With approximately 264,000 active, full-time 

equivalent team members, we serve one in three households in 
America and ranked No. 23 on 
Fortune™s 2011 rankings of 
America™s largest corporations.
 We ranked fourth in assets and 
first in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. 
banks at December 31, 2011.  
 Our vision is to satisfy all our customers™ financial needs, 
help them succeed financially, 
be recognized as the premier 
financial services company in our markets and be one of 

Ameri
ca™s great companies. Our pri
mary strategy to achieve this 
vision is to increase the numb
er of products our customers 
utilize and to offer them all of th
e financial products that fulfill 
their needs. Our cross-sell strategy, diversified business model 
and the breadth of our geographic reach facilitate growth in both 
strong and weak economic cycles, as we can grow by expanding 

the number of products our current customers have with us, gain 

new customers in our extended markets, and increase market 
share in many businesses. Our retail bank household cross-sell 
increased each quarter during 2011 to 5.92 products per 

household in fourth quarter 2011, up from 5.70 in fourth quarter 
2010. We believe there is more op
portunity for cross-sell as we 
continue to earn more business from our customers. Our goal is 
eight products per customer, which is approximately half of our 

estimate of potential demand for an average U.S. household. 
Currently, one of every four of our retail banking households has 
eight or more products. 
 Our pursuit of growth and earnings performance is 
influenced by our belief that it is important to maintain a well 
controlled operating environment. We manage our credit risk by 
establishing what we believe 
are sound credit policies for 
underwriting new business, whil
e monitoring and reviewing the 
performance of our loan portfolio. We manage the interest rate 
and market risks inherent in our asset and liability balances 

within established ranges, while ensuring adequate liquidity and 

funding. We maintain strong capi
tal levels to facilitate future 
growth. 

 Expense management is also important to us, but we 

approach this in a manner intended to help ensure our revenue 

is not adversely affected. Our current company-wide expense 
management initiative is focused on removing unnecessary 
complexity and eliminating duplic
ation as a way to improve the 

customer experience and the work
 process of our team members. 
With this initiative and the co
mpletion of Wachovia merger 
integration activities, we are targeting fourth quarter 2012 

noninterest expense of $11 billion. We expect first quarter 2012 
noninterest expense to remain elevated because of seasonally 
higher personnel expenses and our final quarter of Wachovia 
integration expenses, partially of
fset by continued gains from 
efficiency and cost save initiati
ves. We expect quarterly total 
expenses to decline over the rest of 2012, driven by the benefit 

from ongoing efficiency initia
tives and the conclusion of 
integration activities. However, quarterly expenses may vary due 
to cyclical or seasonal factors, among others. In addition, we will 
continue to invest in our businesses and add team members 
where appropriate. 

 
Financial Performance 
Our 2011 results were strong despite continued economic 
volatility during the year, with improved credit quality and lower 

expenses as well as solid growth
 in deposits and capital, which 
funded growth in loans and investment securities. Regulatory 

reform and related initiatives also created a difficult 
environment in which to achieve strong financial performance. 

For example, changes mandated by Regulation E and related 
overdraft policy changes implemented in third quarter 2010 
decreased our service charges on deposit accounts. Also, 
implementation of the Durbin 
Amendment to the Dodd-Frank 
Act in fourth quarter 2011 redu
ced debit interchange fees and 
the mortgage servicing regulatory consent orders that we 

entered into with our regulators in April 2011 and other 

regulatory activities contributed to lowered residential mortgage 
26  servicing rights (MSRs) valuation and increased our estimate of 
losses for repurchases of serviced loans.  

 Wells Fargo net income was $15.9 billion and diluted 
earnings per common share were $2.82 for 2011, both up 28% 
from 2010. Our net income growth from 2010 was primarily 
driven by a lower provision for credit losses and lower 
noninterest expense, which more than offset lower revenues. Net 

income growth from 2010 included contributions from each of 
our three business segments: Community Banking (up 30%); 
Wholesale Banking (up 19%); and Wealth, Brokerage and 

Retirement (up 28%). Return on average assets was 1.25% for 
2011, compared with 1.01% for 2010. Our return on equity was 
11.93% in 2011, up from 10.33% in 2010.  

 On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down 5% in 2011, 
predominantly reflecting decreased interest income on securities 
available for sale and loans due to lower yields as market rates 

declined. The decline in revenue was also affected by lower 
mortgage banking noninterest income as a result of lower 
originations and higher servicing-related costs caused by the 
regulatory consent orders and other mortgage-related regulatory 
matters as well as lower net gains from trading activities. These 

decreases in revenue were partially
 offset by increased interest 
income on trading assets and decreased interest expense. 

Noninterest expense was down 2% from 2010 reflecting the 

benefit of reduced merger integration costs and lower foreclosed 
asset expense.  
 We believe loan and deposit gr
owth have positioned us for 
continued improvement in financial performance. Total loans 

were $769.6 billion at December 31
, 2011, up from $757.3 billion 
at December 31, 2010, and aver
aged $757.1 billion for 2011 
compared with $770.6 billion for 2010. The net growth in loans 

from December 31, 2010, incl
uded the consolidation of 
$5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans previously sold as well as 

the purchases with a period end balance of $3.6 billion of U.S.-
based commercial real estate (CRE), offset by a $21.0 billion 
decrease in our non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios. 

Our core deposits totaled $872.6
 billion at December 31, 2011, 
up 9% from December 31, 2010, and our average core deposits 

grew 7% from 2010 to $826.7 billion for 2011. Average core 

deposits were 109% of average loans for 2011, up from 100% for 
2010. We continued to attract high
 quality core deposits in the 
form of checking and savings deposits, which on average totaled 
$757.0 billion, up 11% from 2010 as we added new customers 

and deepened our relationships with existing customers. Average 

core checking and savings deposits were 92% of average core 

deposits, up from 89% for 2010. 
 Table 1 provides a six-year summary of selected financial 
data and Table 2 presents key ratios and per common share data. 

 Credit Quality  
As in 2010, we again experienced credit improvement during 

2011 in our loan portfolios with lower net charge-offs and 
improved or stable delinquency trends. The rate of improvement 
moderated in some portfolios dur
ing the latter half of 2011, 
consistent with our expectations at
 this point in the credit cycle. 
The improvement in our credit po
rtfolio was due in part to the 
continued decline in balances in our non-strategic and 
liquidating loan portfolios (primarily from the Wachovia 
acquisition), which decreased $21.0 billion during 2011, and 
$78.5 billion in total since the beginning of 2009, to 

$112.3 billion at December 31, 2011.  
 Reflecting the continued improved credit performance in our 
loan portfolios, the $7.9 billion provision for credit losses for 
2011 was $7.9 billion less than a 
year ago. The 2011 provision for 
credit losses was $3.4 billion less than net charge-offs, compared 
with $2.0 billion less for 2010. 
Absent significant deterioration 
in the economy, we expect futu
re allowance releases in 2012, 
although at more modest levels. Since first quarter 2010 net 

charge-offs have decreased every quarter until fourth quarter 
2011 when they were es
sentially flat compared with third quarter 
2011. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) have decreased every 
quarter since their peak in thir
d quarter 2010. Net charge-offs 
totaled $11.3 billion for 2011, compared with $17.8 billion for 

2010. NPAs decreased to $26.0 billion at December 31, 2011, 

from $32.3 billion at December 31, 2010. Loans 90 days or more 
past due and still accruing (excluding government 
insured/guaranteed loans) decreased to $2.0 billion at 
December 31, 2011, from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010. In 
addition, our portfolio of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans 

continued to perform better than expected at the time of 
acquisition. 
  
Capital 
We continued to build capital in 2011, with total equity up 
$13.8 billion to $141.7 billion from December 31, 2010. Our Tier 

1 common equity ratio grew 116 basis points during 2011 to 

9.46% of risk-weighted assets under Basel I, reflecting strong 
internal capital generation. Ba
sed on our interpretation of 
current Basel III capital proposals,
 we estimate that our Tier 1 
common equity ratio was 7.50% at the end of 2011. Our other 
regulatory capital ratios remained strong with a Tier 1 capital 
ratio of 11.33% and Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.03% at 
December 31, 
2011. See the ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section in this 
Report for more information regarding our capital, including 
Tier 1 common equity. 
 During 2011 we redeemed $9.2 billion of trust preferred 
securities that carried a higher cost than other funding sources 

available to us, repurchased approximately 80 million shares of 
our common stock and entered into two separate $150 million 
private forward repurchase tran
sactions. The first transaction 
settled in fourth quarter 2011 for approximately 6 million shares 
of common stock and the second transaction settled in first 

quarter 2012 for approximately 6 million shares of common 
stock. We also paid common stock dividends of $0.12 per share 
each quarter in 2011. 27Overview

29  Earnings Performance   Wells Fargo net income for 2011 was $15.9 billion ($2.82 diluted 
earnings per common share) compared with $12.4 billion 
($2.21 diluted earnings per common share) for 2010 and 
$12.3 billion ($1.75 diluted earnings per common share) for 
2009. Our 2011 earnings reflected strong execution of our 

business strategy in a difficult economic environment. The key 
drivers of our financial performance in 2011 were improved 
credit quality, lower operating costs, diversified sources of fee 

income, balanced net interest and fee income, a diversified loan 
portfolio and increased deposits.  
 Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest 

income, was $80.9 billion in 2011
, compared with $85.2 billion 
in 2010 and $88.7 billion in 2009. The decline in revenue in 

2011 was predominantly due to lower net interest income, 

mortgage banking and net gains from trading activities. Net 
interest income of $42.8 billion in 2011, represented 53% of 
revenue, compared with $44.8 billion (53%) in 2010 and 
$46.3 billion (52%) in 2009. The 4%
 decline in 2011 net interest 
income from 2010 reflected a 32 
basis points decline in the net 
interest margin and a 2% decline 
in average loans. The decline in 
average loans from 2010 reflected reductions in the non-

strategic and liquidating loan portfolios, partially offset by loan 

growth and loan acquisitions. Continued success in generating 
low-cost deposits enabled the Company to grow assets by 
funding loan and securities growth while reducing higher cost 

long-term debt. 
Noninterest income was $38.2 billion in 2011, representing 
47% of revenue, compared with $40.5 billion (47%) in 2010 and 

$42.4 billion (48%) in 2009. The decrease in noninterest income 
in 2011 was due largely to lower service charges on deposit 
accounts, net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 

and net gains from trading activities. 
 Noninterest expense was $49.4 billion in 2011, compared 
with $50.5 billion in 2010 and $49.0 billion in 2009. 

Noninterest expense as a percentage of revenue was 61% in 2011, 
59% in 2010 and 55% in 2009. Noninterest expense for 2011 
included $1.7 billion of Wachovia merger-related integration 

expense, compared with $1.9 billion in 2010 and $895 million in 
2009.

expense as a percentage of revenue for year-over-year results.

  31Earnings Performance 
(continued) 
 Net Interest Income
 Net interest income is the intere
st earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid for deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest 

income and the net interest marg
in are presented on a taxable-
equivalent basis in Table 5 to consistently reflect income from 

taxable and tax-exempt loans 
and securities based on a 
35% federal statutory tax rate. 
 Net interest income and the net interest margin are 
significantly influenced by the mix and overall size of our 

earning asset portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In 
addition, some sources of interest income, such as loan 
prepayment fees and collection of
 interest on nonaccrual loans, 
can vary from period to period. Net interest income on a taxable-
equivalent basis was $43.5 billion in 2011, compared with 
$45.4 billion in 2010 and $47.0 bi
llion in 2009. The net interest 
margin was 3.94% in 2011, down 32 basis points from 4.26% in 
2010 and down 34 basis points from 4.28% in 2009. The decline 

in net interest income and the net interest margin was largely 
due to repricing of the balance sheet as higher-yielding loan and 
security runoff was partially offset by new loans, investment 

portfolio purchases and growth in short-term investments. The 
decline in earning asset income 
was mitigated by a reduction in 
funding costs resulting from disciplined deposit pricing, debt 
maturities, and redemptions of higher cost trust preferred 

securities. 
 Table 4 presents the components of earning assets and 
funding sources as a percentage of earning assets and provides 

an analysis of year-over-year chan
ges that influenced net interest 
income. 

 Soft consumer loan demand and the impact of liquidating 
certain loan portfolios reduced average loans in 2011 to 69% of 
average earning assets compared
 with 72% in 2010. Average 
short-term investments and trading account assets were 12% of 
earning assets in 2011 up from 9% in 2010. 
Core deposits are an important low-cost source of funding 
and affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 

Core deposits include noninter
est-bearing deposits, interest-
bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and 
other savings, and certain foreign deposits (Eurodollar sweep 
balances). Average core deposits 
rose to $826.7 billion in 2011 
from $772.0 billion in 2010 and funded 109% and 100% of 
average loans, respectively. Average core deposits increased to 
75% of average earning assets in 2011, compared with 73% a year 
ago. The cost of these deposits declined significantly as the mix 

shifted from higher cost certificates of deposit to checking and 
savings products, which were also at lower yields
 relative to 
2010. About 91% of our average core deposits are in checking 
and savings deposits, one of th
e highest percentages in the 
industry. 

 Table 5 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. The effect on interest 
income and costs of earning 
asset and funding mix changes 
described above, combined with 
rate changes during 2011, are 
analyzed in Table 6.

        (1) Because the Wachovia acquisition was completed at the end of 2008,
 Wachovia's assets and liabilities are included in average ba
lances, and Wachovia's results are reflected 
in interest income/expense beginning in 2009. 
(2) Our average prime rate was 3.25%, 3.25%, 3.25%, 5.09%, and 8.05% for 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The averag
e three-month London Interbank 
Offered Rate (LIBOR) was 0.34%, 0.34%, 0.69%, 2.93%, and 5.30% for the same years, respectively.
 (3) Yields/rates and amounts include the effects of hedge and risk ma
nagement activities associated with the respective asset and l
iability categories.
 (4) Yields and rates are based on interest income/expense amounts for the period, annualized based on the accrual basis for the res
pective accounts. The average balance 
amounts represent amortized cost and the previously reported average balance amounts for all periods prior to 2011 have been ch
anged to amortized cost, the basis used to 
determine yields for those periods.

 periods presented.
    35Earnings Performance 
(continued) 
  Table 6 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 

average rates for both interest-earning assets and 
interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous 
simultaneous volume and rate changes during any period, it is
not possible to precisely allocate such changes between volume 
and rate. For this table, changes th
at are not solely due to either 
volume or rate are allocated to th
ese categories in proportion to 
the percentage changes in aver
age volume and average rate.

                      Noninterest income of $38.2 billion represented 47% of revenue 
for 2011 compared with $40.5 billion, or 47%, for 2010. The 

decrease in noninterest income from 2010 was due largely to 
lower service charges on deposit accounts, lower net gains on 
mortgage loan origination/sales activities and lower net gains 

from trading activities.  
 Our service charges on deposit accounts decreased in 2011 by 
$636 million, or 13% from 2010, predominantly due to changes 

implemented in third quarter 2010 mandated by Regulation E 
(which limited certain overdraft fees) and related overdraft 
policy changes.  

 We earn trust, investment and IRA (Individual Retirement 
Account) fees from managing and administering assets, 
including mutual funds, corpor
ate trust, personal trust, 
employee benefit trust and agency assets. At December 31, 2011, 

these assets totaled $2.2 trillion
, up 5% from $2.1 trillion at 
December 31, 2010. Trust, invest
ment and IRA fees are largely 
based on a tiered scale relative 
to the market value of the assets 
under management or administration. These fees increased to 

$4.1 billion in 2011 from $4.0 billion in 2010. 

 We receive commissions and other fees for providing services 
to full-service and discount brokerage customers as well as from 
investment banking activities including equity and bond 
underwriting. These fees increased to $7.2 billion in 2011 from 
$6.9 billion in 2010. Our commission and other fees include 

transactional commissions, which 
are based on the number of 
transactions executed at the 
customer™s direction, and 
asset-based fees, which are base
d on the market value of the 
customer™s assets. Brokerage client assets totaled $
1.1 trillion 
and $1.2 trillion at December 
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 Card fees were $3.7 billion in 2011, essentially flat from 2010. 

Legislative and regulatory changes enacted in 2010 led to a 
reduction in card fee income, which was offset by growth in 

purchase volume and new accounts growth. The final Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) rules 
implementing the Durbin 
Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Ac
t became effective in October 
2011, placing limits on debit card interchange fees. As a result, 

debit card interchange fees were reduced by $365 million during 
fourth quarter 2011 as compared 
to fees that would have been 
earned without the limits. We currently expect future volume, 
product or account changes may over time mitigate at least half 
of the earnings reduction resulting from the FRB™s debit card 

interchange rules. 
 Mortgage banking noninterest income, consisting of net 
servicing income and net gains on loan origination/sales 
activities, totaled $7.8 billion in 
2011, compared with $9.7 billion 
in 2010. The reduction in mortga
ge banking noninterest income 
was primarily driven by a decline in net gains on mortgage loan 

origination/sales activities as discussed below.  
 Net mortgage loan servicing income includes both changes in 

the fair value of MSRs during the 
period as well as changes in the 
value of derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge the MSRs. 

Net servicing income for 2011 included a $1.6 billion net MSR 

valuation gain ($3.7 billion decr
ease in the fair value of the 
MSRs offset by a $5.3 billion hedge gain) and for 2010 included 
a $1.5 billion net MSR valuation gain ($3.0 billion decrease in 
the fair value of MSRs offset by a $4.5 billion hedge gain). See 

the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and 
Market Riskﬂ section of this Report for additional information 
regarding our MSRs risks and hedging approach. The valuation 
of our MSRs at the end of 2011
 reflected our assessment of 
expected future levels in servicing and foreclosure costs. See the 
ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Management 
Œ Risks Relating 
to Servicing Activitiesﬂ section in this Report for information o
n the regulatory consent orders. Our portfolio of loans serviced for 

others was $1.85 trillion at Dece
mber 31, 2011, and $1.84 trillion 
at December 31, 2010. At Decemb
er 31, 2011, the ratio of MSRs 

to related loans serviced for others was 0.76%, compared with 

0.86% at December 31, 2010. 

 Income from loan origination/sale activities was $4.6 billion 

in 2011 compared with $6.4 billio
n in 2010. The decrease in 2011 
was driven by lower loan origination volume and margins on 
loan originations, partially offset by lower provision for 
mortgage loan repurchase losses. Residential real estate 

originations were $357 billion in 2011, compared with 
$386 billion a year ago, and mortgage applications were 
$537 billion in 2011, compared with $620 billion in 2010. The   

1-4 family first mortgage unclosed pipeline was $72 billion at 
December 31, 2011, and $73 billion at December 31, 2010. For 
additional information

37Earnings Performance 
(continued) 
  Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
include the cost of any additions to the mortgage repurchase 

liability. Mortgage loans are repurchased from third parties 
based on standard representations and warranties, and early 
payment default clauses in mortgage
 sale contracts. Additions to 
the mortgage repurchase liability that were charged against net 

gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities during 2011 

totaled $1.3 billion (compared with $1.6 billion for 2010), of 
which $1.2 billion ($1.5 billion for 2010) was for subsequent 
increases in estimated losses on prior year™s loan sa
les. For 
additional information about mortgage loan repurchases, see the 
ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Management 
Œ Liability for 
Mortgage Loan Repurchase Lossesﬂ section 
and Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 

Report. 
 Net gains from trading activities, which reflect unrealized 

changes in fair value of our trading positions and realized gains 
and losses, were $1.0 billion in 
2011 and $1.6 billion in 2010. 
The year-over-year decrease was driven by challenging market 
conditions, including sovereign 
debt concerns, which pressured 
credit spreads, reduced prices on financial assets and limited 
new issue origination and trading opportunities. The decline also 
reflects a loss of $377 million in 2011 relating to our resolution of 
a legacy Wachovia position. Net gains from trading activities do 

not include interest income and other fees earned from related 
activities. Those amounts are repo
rted within interest income 
from trading assets and other noninterest income, respectively, 
in the income statement. Net gains from trading activities are 

primarily from trading conducted on behalf of or driven by the 
needs of our customers (customer accommodation trading) and 
also include the results of certain economic hedging and 

proprietary trading activity. Net gains (losses) from proprietary 
trading were a $14 million net loss in 2011 and a $22 million net 
gain in 2010. Proprietary trading results also included interest 
and fees reported in their corresponding income statement line 
items. Proprietary trading activi
ties are not significant to our 
client-focused business model. Our trading activities, customer 
accommodation, economic hedgin
g and proprietary trading are 
further discussed in the ﬁAsset/Liability Management Œ
 Market 
Risk 
Œ Trading Ac
tivitiesﬂ section in this Report.
  Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $1.5 billion for 
2011 and $455 million for 2010, after other-than-temporary 

impairment (OTTI) write downs of $711 million for 2011 and 

$940 million for 2010. Included in net gains on debt and equity 

securities for 2011 was a $271 million gain related to a legacy 

Wachovia position, due to redemption of our interest in an 
investment fund. Other income in 2011 also included a 
$153 million gain on the sale of our H.D. Vest Financial Services 

business.

            Noninterest expense was $49.4 billion in 2011, down 2% from 
$50.5 billion in 2010, driven by lower merger integration costs, 
which also contributed to decreases in equipment expense 

($2.3 billion, down from $2.6 billion in 2010), lower contract 

services expense ($1.4 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2010) 
and lower foreclosed asset expense ($1.4 billion, down from 
$1.5 billion in 2010). The increase in 2010 over 2009 was 
predominantly due to merger in
tegration costs, Wells Fargo 
Financial restructuring costs and a $400 million charitable 
donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation.  
 Personnel-related expenses were up 2% in 2011 compared 
with 2010, primarily due to higher revenues generated by 

businesses with revenue-based compensation, including the 
retail securities brokerage and mortgage businesses, and 
severance expense related to our expense initiative. 

 Outside professional services included increased investments 
by our businesses in 2011 in their service delivery systems and 
approximately $100 million of higher costs associated with the 

mortgage servicing regulatory consent orders. 
 Merger integration costs tota
led $1.7 billion in 2011 and 
$1.9 billion in 2010. The integration of Wachovia remained on 
track, and with the successful 
North Carolina conversion in 
October 2011, all retail banking store conversions are complete. 

Remaining integration activities ar
e expected to be concluded by 
first quarter 2012.  
 We continue to target $11 billion of noninterest expense for 
fourth quarter 2012. However, we
 currently expect first quarter 
2012 expenses to remain elevated driven by seasonally higher 
personnel expenses and our final quarter of Wachovia 
integration expenses, partially of
fset by continued gains from 
efficiency and cost save initiatives. 
 Income Tax Expense
 The 2011 annual effective tax ra
te was 31.9% compared with 
33.9% in 2010 and 30.3% in 2009. The lower effective tax rate 
for 2011 reflected tax benefits from the realization for tax 
purposes of a previously written down investment, a decrease in 
tax expense associated with leveraged leases, as well as tax 
benefits related to charitable donations of appreciated securities.

 Operating Segment Results 
We are organized for management reporting purposes into three 
operating segments: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; 
and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement. These segments are 
defined by product type and cust
omer segment and their results 
are based on our management accounting process, for which 

there is no comprehensive, authoritative financial accounting 

guidance equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). In fourth quarter 2010, we aligned certain lending 
businesses into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking to 
reflect our previously announced restructuring of Wells Fargo 
Financial. In first quarter 2011, we realigned a private equity 
business into Wholesale Banking from Community Banking. 
Prior
 periods have been revised to reflect these changes. Table 9 
and the following discussion present our results by operating 
segment. For a more complete description of our operating 
segments, including additional 
financial information and the 
underlying management accounting process, see Note 24 
(Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report.

 offers a complete line of diversified 
financial products and services for consumers and small 
businesses including investment, in
surance and trust services in 
39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity loans in all 
50 states and D.C. through its Regional Banking and Wells Fargo 
Home Mortgage business units.  

 Community Banking reported net income of $9.1 billion and 
revenue of $50.7 billion in 2011. 
Revenue decreased $3.8 billion, 
or 7%, from 2010 due to reduced mortgage banking income, 
lower yields on investment securities and expected reductions in 
the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios, partially offset 
by long-term debt run-off and lower deposit costs. Net interest 
income decreased $2.3 billion, or 7%, from 2010, mostly due to 
lower average loans (down $32.0 billion from 2010) as a result 

of planned run-off in the non-strategic and liquidating loan 
portfolios (including home equity and Pick-A-Pay), loan 
repricing at lower rates, and lower yields on our investment 

securities. This decline in interest income was mitigated by long-
term debt run-off and continued low funding costs. Average core 
deposits increased $19.8 billion, or 4%, from 2010, as growth in 

liquid deposits more than offset maturities of higher yielding 

certificates of deposit. The number of consumer checking 
accounts grew 3.2% from December 31, 2010. Noninterest 
income decreased $1.5 billion, or 7%, from 2010, mainly due to 
lower volume-related mortgage banking income and lower 
deposit service charges as a result of the third quarter 2010 

implementation of Regulation E, partially offset by lower other 
than temporary impairments. 
Noninterest expense decreased 
$837 million, or 3%, from 2010, due to reduced expenses across 
most categories, as well as a 2010 charitable donation expense of 
$400 million. The provision for credit losses decreased 
$5.8 billion from 2010 as credit quality in most of our consumer 
and business loan portfolios continued to improve. Charge-offs 
decreased $4.8 billion from 2010, reflecting improvement 

primarily in the home equity, credit card, and small business 
lending portfolios. Additionally, we released $2.4 billion of 
allowance for credit losses in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion 
released in 2010. 
 Wholesale Banking
 provides financial solutions across the 
U.S. and globally to middle market and large corporate 
customers with annual revenue generally in excess of 
$20 million. Products and businesses include commercial 

banking, investment banking and capital markets, securities 
investment, government and institutional banking, corporate 
banking, commercial real estate, treasury management, capital 
finance, international, insurance, real estate capital markets, 
commercial mortgage servicing, corporate trust, equipment 
finance, asset backed finance, and asset management. 

 Wholesale Banking reported net income of $7.0 billion in 
2011, up $1.1 billion, or 19%, from $5.9 billion in 2010. Average 
loans of $249.1 billion increased $18.6 billion, or 8%, driven by 

strong demand from both our domestic and international 
customers. Average core deposits of $202.1 billion in 2011 
increased $32.1 billion, or 19%, from 2010 reflecting continued 

strong customer liquidity.  
 The year over year increase in
 net income was the result of a 
decrease in the provision for 
credit losses and noninterest 
expenses, which more than offset a decrease in revenue. 

Revenue decreased $759 million, or 3%, from 2010, as broad-
based growth among many businesses, including strong loan 
and deposit growth, was offset by lower PCI resolutions revenue, 
lower sales and trading revenu
e, and lower crop insurance 
revenue.  
 Total noninterest expense in 2011 decreased $75 million 
compared with 2010 as lower operating losses and foreclosed 

asset expenses were partially offset by higher personnel expense. 
The provision for credit losses declined $2.0 billion from 2010, 
and reflected a $1.6 billion improvement in net credit losses 
along with a $950 million allowance release (compared with a 

$561 million release in 2010). 

 Wholesale Banking™s 2011 fina
ncial results benefited from 
loan portfolio acquisitions and strong borrowing demand across 
40  all customers segments, with most lending areas experiencing 
double-digit rates of growth in loans outstandings, including in 

Asset Backed Finance, Capital Finance, Commercial Banking,

 Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement reported net income of 
$1.3 billion in 2011, up $283 million, or 28%, from 2010. 
Revenue increased $458 million, or 4%, from 2010, as net 
interest income increased $148 million, or 5%, and noninterest 
income increased $310 million, or 3%, from 2010. Net interest 

income increased due to higher
 investment income and the 
impact of deposit balance growth. Average core deposits of 

$130.4 billion in 2011 increased 8% from 2010. Noninterest 

income increased as higher asset-based fees and a gain on the 
sale of the H.D. Vest Financial Services business exceeded losses 
on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in expense) 

and lower brokerage transaction revenue. Noninterest expense 
increased $167 million, or 2%, from 2010, primarily due to 
growth in personnel cost largely due to higher broker 

commissions driven by increased production levels, as well as 
increases in other incentive compensation, offset by lower 
deferred compensation. The provision for credit losses 
decreased $164 million, or 49%, from 2010, due to lower net 
charge-offs.  
 Balance Sheet Analysis 
 During 2011, our total assets grew 4%, funded by core deposit 

growth of 9% and internal capital generation, partially offset by a 
reduction in our long-term borrowings. Our total loans and core 
deposits at December 31, 2011, we
re up from the previous year. 
At December 31, 2011, core depo
sits totaled 113% of the loan 
portfolio, and we have the capacity to add higher yielding 

earning assets to generate futu
re revenue and earnings growth. 
The strength of our business model produced record earnings 
and high rates of internal capital generation as reflected in our 
improved capital ratios. Tier 1 
capital increased to 11.33% as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 common 

equity to 9.46% at December 31
, 2011, up from 11.16% and 
8.30%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Total capital was 

14.76% and Tier 1 leverage was 9.03%, compared with 15.01% 
and 9.19%, respectively, at December 2010. For additional 
information about our capital requirements, see Note 26 

(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 
 The following discussion prov
ides additional information 
about the major components of 
our balance sheet. Information 
about changes in our asset mix and about our capital is included 

in the ﬁEarnings Performance Œ
 Net Interest Incomeﬂ and 
ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section

                     Table 10 presents a summary of our securities available-for-
sale portfolio. Securities available for sale consist of both debt 
and marketable equity securities. We hold debt securities 
available for sale primarily for liquidity, interest rate risk 
management and long-term yield enhancement. Accordingly, 
this portfolio consists primarily 
of liquid, high-quality federal 
agency debt and privately issued mortgage-backed securities 

(MBS). The total net unrealized gains on securities available for 
sale were $7.0 billion at Dece
mber 31, 2011, down from net 
unrealized gains of $8.3 billion 
at December 31, 2010, primarily 
due to gains realized from sales partially offset by slight 
widening of credit spreads in some asset classes. 
 We analyze securities for OTTI quarterly, or more often if a 
potential loss-triggering event o
ccurs. Of the $711 million OTTI 
write-downs recognized in 2011, $423 million related to debt 

securities. There were $118 million in OTTI write-downs for 
41Balance Sheet Analysis 
(continued) 
 marketable equity securities and $170 million in OTTI write-
downs related to nonmarketable equity securities. For a 

discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and underlying 
considerations and analysis see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies 
Œ Securities) and Note 5 (Securities 
Available for Sale) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 At December 31, 2011, debt securities available for sale 

included $32.6 billion of municipal bonds, of which 78% were 
rated ﬁA
-ﬂ or better, based on external
 and, in some cases, 
internal ratings. Additionally, some of these bonds are 
guaranteed against loss by bo
nd insurers. These guaranteed 
bonds are predominantly investme
nt grade and were generally 
underwritten in accordance with
 our own investment standards 
prior to the determin
ation to purchase, without relying on the 
bond insurer™s guarantee in ma
king the investment decision. 
Our municipal bond holdings continue to be monitored as part of our 

ongoing impairment analysis of our securities available for sale. 
 The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities 
available for sale was 4.9 years 
at December 31, 2011. Because 
61% of this portfolio is MBS, the expected remaining maturity 
may differ from contractual maturity because borrowers 

generally have the right to pr
epay obligations before the 
underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effect of a 

200 basis point increase or decrease
 in interest rates on the fair 
value and the expected remaining
 maturity of the MBS available 
for sale are shown in Table 11.

42  Loan Portfolio 
Total loans were $769.6 billion
 at December 31, 2011, up 
$12.4 billion from December 31, 2010. Table 12 provides a 
summarized breakdown by loan port
folio. Increased balances in 
many commercial loan portfolios more than offset the continued 
reduction in the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios, 
which have declined $21.0 billion since December 31, 2010, as 

well as the soft demand in consumer loans in response to 
economic conditions. Additional information on the non-
strategic and liquidating loan portfolios is included in Table 17 in 

the ﬁCredit Risk Management
ﬂ section of this Report.
 Many loan portfolios had double-digit year-over-year loan 
growth in average balances, including government and 
institutional banking, asset-backed finance, capital finance, 
commercial banking, commercial real estate, international and 
real estate capital markets. Included in the growth of loans from 
year end 2010 were loan purchases in 2011 with a period end 
balance of $3.6 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate. 

Consumer loans include the consolidation of $5.6 billion of 
reverse mortgage loans previously sold.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are 
not recorded in the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded in the balance shee
t in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notion
al amount of the transaction. 
These transactions are designed 
to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 

(3) diversify our funding sources, and/or (4) optimize capital. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Transactio
ns with Unconsolidated 
Entities 
We routinely enter into various types of on- and off-balance 

sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which 
are corporations, trusts or partne
rships that are established for 
a limited purpose. Historically, the majority of SPEs were 

formed in connection with securitization transactions. For 
more information on securitizations, including sales proceeds 
and cash flows from securitization
s, see Note 8 (Securitizations 
and Variable Interest Entities) to
 Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

 Guarantees and Certain Contingent Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that co
ntingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party 
based on an event or a change 
in an underlying asset, liability,
 rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities 
lending and other indemnifications, liquidity agreements, 
written put options, recourse obligations, residual value 
guarantees and contingent consideration. 

 For more information on guarantees and certain contingent 
arrangements, see Note 14 (Guarantees) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 
44  Contractual Obligations 
In addition to the contractua
l commitments and arrangements 
previously described, which, de
pending on the nature of the 
obligation, may or may not require use of our resources, we 
enter into other contractual obligations in the ordinary course 
of business, including debt 
issuances for the funding of 
operations and leases for premises and equipment. 
Table 15 summarizes these co
ntractual obligations as of 
December 31, 2011, excluding obligations for short-term 

borrowing arrangements and pension and postretirement 
benefit plans. More information on those obligations is in Note 
12 (Short-Term Borrowings) and Note 20 (Employee Benefits 
and Other Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

  We are subject to the income ta
x laws of the U.S., its states 
and municipalities, and those of
 the foreign jurisdictions in 
which we operate. We have
 various unrecognized tax 
obligations related to these operations that may require future 
cash tax payments to various taxing authorities. Because of 
their uncertain nature, the expected timing and amounts of 
these payments generally are not reasonably estimable or 

determinable. We estimate the 
amount payable in the next 12 
months based on the status of our tax examinations and 

settlement discussions. See Note 21 (Income Taxes) to 

Financial Statements in this Report for more information. 
 We enter into derivatives, which create contractual 
obligations, as part of our interest rate risk management 

process for our customers or for other trading activities. See 
the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Asset/Liabilityﬂ section and Note
 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for more 
information.  
 Transactions with Related Parties 
The Related Party Disclosures topic of the Financial 

Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards 
Codification (Codification) requires disclosure of material 

related-party transactions, other than compensation 
arrangements, expense allowances and other similar items in 
the ordinary course of business. We had no material related-

party transactions required to 
be reported for the years ended 
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
45  Risk Management 
 All financial institutions must manage and control a variety of 
business risks that can significantly affect their financial 
performance. Key among those are credit, asset/liability and 
market risk. The discussion that
 follows provides information 
on how we manage these risks.

 (1)  Substantially all of our foreign loan portfolio is commercial. Loans are classified as 
foreign if the borrower™s primary address is outside of the United States.
  We employ various credit risk management and monitoring 
activities to mitigate risks associ
ated with multiple risk factors 
affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate
 including: 
 Loan concentrations and related credit quality 
 Counterparty credit risk 
 Economic and market conditions 
 Legislative or regulatory mandates 
 Changes in interest rates 
 Merger and acquisition activities 
 Reputation risk 
  Our credit risk management pr
ocess is governed centrally, 
but provides for decentralized management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 

comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, 
extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review 
and audit process. The Credit Committee of our Board of 
Directors (Board) receives reports from management, 

including our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, and 
its responsibilities include oversight of the administration and 
effectiveness of, and compliance with, our credit policies and 

the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. 
 A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well 
controlled underwriting proc
ess, which we believe is 
appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors 

who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.  
46  Non-Strategic and Liquidating Loan Portfolios
  We continually evaluate and modify our credit policies to address 
appropriate levels of risk. We may designate certain portfolios 
and loan products as non-strategic or liquidating to cease their 
continued origination as we actively work to limit losses and 
reduce our exposures. 
 Table 17 identifies our non-strategic and liquidating loan 

portfolios. They consist primaril
y of the Pick-a-Pay mortgage 
portfolio and other PCI loans acquired from Wachovia as well 

as some portfolios from legacy Wells Fargo Home Equity and 
Wells Fargo Financial. Effective first quarter 2011, we added 
our education finance government guaranteed loan portfolio to 

the non-strategic and liquidating loan portfolios as there is no 
longer a U.S. Government guar
anteed student loan program 
available to private financial inst
itutions pursuant to legislation 
in 2010. The outstanding balances on non-strategic and 
liquidating loan portfolios have decreased 41% since the

Effective first quarter 2011, we included our education finance government guaranteed loan portfolio as there is no longer a U.
S. Government guaranteed student loan 
program available to private financial institutions, pursuant to legislation in 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to refle
ct this change. 
                   The Wells Fargo Financial debt consolidation portfolio 
included $1.1 billion of loans at December 31, 2011, that were 
considered prime based on secondary market standards, 

compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010. The rest is 
non-prime but was originated with underwriting standards to 
reduce credit risk. Wells Fargo Financial ceased originating 

loans and leases through its indirect auto business channel by 
the end of 2008. 
 The home equity liquidating 
portfolio was designated in 
fourth quarter 2007 from loan
s generated through third party 
channels. This portfolio is discussed in more detail in the

 PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
  Loans acquired 
with evidence of credit deterior
ation since their origination and 
where it is probable that we 
will not collect all contractually 
required principal and interest 
payments are accounted for using 
the measurement provisions for PCI loans. PCI loans are 
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the 
historical allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not 

carried over. Such loans are consid
ered to be accruing due to the 
existence of the accretable yiel
d and not based on consideration 
given to contractual interest payments. Substantially all of our 

PCI loans were acquired in the Wachovia acquisition on 
December 31, 2008. 
 A nonaccretable difference is
 established for PCI loans to 
absorb losses expected on those loa
ns at the date of acquisition. 
Amounts absorbed by the nonaccre
table difference do not affect 
the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. 

 Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign 
PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, 
Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated 
into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each 
pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite 

interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. 
 Resolutions of loans may include sales to third parties, 
receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or 

foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an 
individual PCI loan from a pool based on comparing the amount 
received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any 

difference between these amoun
ts is absorbed by the 
nonaccretable difference. This re
moval method assumes that the 
amount received from resolution approximates pool 
performance expectations. The accretable yield percentage is 
unaffected by the resolution and any changes in the effective 
yield for the remaining loans in 
the pool are addressed by our 
quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each pool. For loans 
that are resolved by payment in 
full, there is no release of the 
nonaccretable difference for th
e pool because there is no 
difference between the amount received at resolution and the 

contractual amount of the loan. Modified PCI loans are not 
removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be 

deemed troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Modified PCI 
loans that are accounted for individually are TDRs, and removed 
from PCI accounting, if there ha
s been a concession granted in 
excess of the original nonaccretab
le difference. We include these 
TDRs in our impaired loans. 

 During 2011, we recognized in
 income $239 million released 
from the nonaccretable differenc
e related to commercial PCI 
loans due to payoffs and other resolutions. We also transferred 

$373 million from the nonaccretable
 difference to the accretable 
yield for PCI loans with improving credit-related cash flows and 

absorbed $2.3 billion of losses in the nonaccretable difference 

from loan resolutions and write-downs. Table 18 provides an 
analysis of changes in th
e nonaccretable difference.

(1) Release of the nonaccretable difference for settlement with borrower, on individually accounted PCI loans, increases interest i
ncome in the period of settlement. Pick-a-Pay 
and Other co
nsumer PCI loans do not reflect nonaccretable difference releases for settlements with borrowers due to pool accounting for t
hose loans, which assumes that the 
amount received approximates the pool performance expectations. 
(2) 
Release of the nonaccretable difference as a result of sales to 
third parties increases noninterest income in the period of the
 sale. 
(3) 
Reclassification of nonaccretable difference to accretable yield 
for loans with increased cash flow estimates will result in in
creased interest income as a prospective yield 
adjustment over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans.  
(4) 
Write-downs to net realizable value of PCI loans are absorbed by the nonaccretable difference when severe delinquency (normally
 180 days) or other indications of severe 
borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the lo
an. 
48   Since December 31, 2008, we have released $5.9 billion in 
nonaccretable difference, includin
g $4.2 billion transferred from 
the nonaccretable difference to
 the accretable yield and 
$1.7 billion released to income through loan resolutions. We 
have provided $1.8 billion in the allowance for credit losses for 
certain PCI loans or pools of PCI loans that have had credit-
related decreases to cash flows expected to be collected. The net 

result is a $4.2 billion reduction from December 31, 2008, 
through December 31, 2011, in our initial projected losses on all 
PCI loans. 
  At December 31, 2011, the allowance for credit losses on 
certain PCI loans was $231 million. The allowance is necessary 

to absorb credit-related decrease
s since acquisition in cash flows 
expected to be collected and primarily relates to individual PCI 
loans. Table 19 analyzes the actua
l and projected loss results on 
PCI loans since acquisition through December 31, 2011.

          Significant Portfolio Reviews
  Measuring and monitoring our 
credit risk is an ongoing proc
ess that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, FICO scores, economic trends by geographic 

areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios (typically 
commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our credit risk 
monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of 
developing risk and to supp
ort our determination of an 
appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following analysis 
reviews the relevant concentrations
 and certain credit metrics of 
our significant portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for 

Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more 

analysis and credit metric information. 
 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)
  The CRE portfolio, 
consisting of both CRE mortgage loans and CRE construction 
loans, totaled $125.4 billion, or 16% of total loans, at 
December 31, 2011. CRE construction loans totaled $19.4 billion 
at December 31, 2011, and CRE mortgage loans totaled 
$106.0 billion, of which 33% was to owner-occupants. Table 20 
summarizes CRE loans by state and property type with the 

related nonaccrual totals. CRE no
naccrual loans totaled 5% of 
the non-PCI CRE outstanding balance at December 31, 2011, a 

decline of 24% from December 31, 2010. The portfolio is 

diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest 
geographic concentrations of
 combined CRE loans are in 
California and Florida, which represented 25% and 9% of the 
total CRE portfolio, respectively
. By property type, the largest 
concentrations are office buildings at 26% and 
industrial/warehouse at 11% of
 the portfolio. We subject 
commercial loans to individual risk assessment using our 

internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are 
aligned to pass and criticized categories with our criticized 

categories aligned to special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories as defined by bank regulatory agencies. At December 

31, 2011, we had $22.5 billion of criticized non-PCI CRE 
mortgage loans, a decrease of 13% from December 31, 2010, and 
$6.8 billion of criticized non-PCI construction loans, a decrease 
of 39% from December 31, 2010. Total criticized non-PCI CRE 
loans remained relatively high as a result of the continued 

challenging conditions in the re
al estate market. See Note 6 
(Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 

in this Report for further detail on criticized loans. 

 The underwriting of CRE loans primarily focuses on cash 
flows inherent in the creditworthiness of the customer, in 
addition to collateral valuations. To identify and manage newly 

emerging problem CRE loans, we employ a high level of 

monitoring and regular customer 
interaction to understand and 
manage the risks associated with
 these loans, including regular 
loan reviews and appraisal updates. Management is engaged to 
identify issues and dedicated workout groups are in place to 
manage problem loans. At December 31, 2011, the recorded 

investment in PCI CRE loans totaled $5.0 billion, down from 
$12.3 billion at December 31, 2008, reflecting the reduction 
resulting from principal payments, loan resolutions and write-

downs.

aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 
according to market segmentation and standard industry 
codes. Table 21 summarizes commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing by industry with
 the related no
naccrual totals. 
Across our non-PCI commercial loans and leases, the 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio 
generally experienced better credit improvement than our CRE 
portfolios in 2011. Of the tota
l commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing non-PCI portfolio, 0.09% was 90 days or 
more past due and still accrui
ng, 1.22% was nonaccruing and 
12.5% was criticized. In compar
ison, of the total non-PCI CRE 
portfolio, 0.29% was 90 days or more past due and still accruing, 

4.97% was nonaccruing and 24.3% 
was criticized. Also, the net 
charge-off rate for both portfolios declined in 2011 from 2010. 
We believe the commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing portfolio is well underwritten and is diverse in its risk 
with relatively level concentrations across several industries. Our 
credit risk management process for this portfolio primarily 
focuses on a customer™s ability to repay the loan through their 

cash flow. 
  A majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing portfolio is secured by sh
ort-term liquid assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory an
d securities, as well as long-
lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 

Generally, the collateral securing
 this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. See Note 6 (Loans and 

Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information.

 51Risk Management 
Š Credit Risk Management 
(continued) 
  During the current credit cy
cle, we have experienced an 
increase in loans requiring risk mitigation activities including 
the restructuring of loan terms and requests for extensions of 
commercial and industrial and CRE 
loans. All actions are based 
on a re-underwriting of the loan and our assessment of the 
borrower™s ability to perform under the
 agreed-upon terms. 
Extension terms generally range from six to thirty-six months 
and may require that the borrowe
r provide additional economic 
support in the form of partial re
payment, or additional collateral 
or guarantees. In cases where the value of collateral or financial 

condition of the borrower is insufficient to repay our loan, we 
may rely upon the support of an
 outside repayment guarantee in 
providing the extension. 
 Our ability to seek performance
 under a guarantee is directly 
related to the guarantor™s creditworthiness, capacity and 

willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 

more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current a
nd future liquidity. We consider the guarantor™s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis as well as other lenders™ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of 
the guarantor™s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are im
portant factors in our allowance 
methodology for commercial and industrial and CRE loans. 

 In considering the
 accrual status of the 
loan, we evaluate the 
collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated support 

of any repayment guarantor. In many cases the strength of the 
guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full repayment of 
the loan is expected. When full and timely collection of the loan 

becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, 
we place the loan on nonaccrual status and we charge-off all or a 

portion of the loan based on the 
fair value of the collateral 
securing the loan, if any. 

 At the time of restructuring, we evaluate whether the loan 

should be classified as a TDR,
 and account for it accordingly.
 For more information on TDRs, see
 ﬁTroubled Debt Restructuringsﬂ 
later in this section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit 

Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 FOREIGN LOANS AND EUROPEAN EXPOSURE
  Our foreign country risk monitoring process 
incorporates frequent dialogue 
with our foreign financial institution customers, counterparties 
and regulatory agencies, enhanced by centralized monitoring of 
macroeconomic and capital markets conditions. We establish 
exposure limits for each country via a centralized oversight 
process based on the needs of our customers, and in 

consideration of relevant economic, political, social, legal, and 
transfer risks. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our 
limits in response to changing 
conditions. We conduct periodic 
stress tests of our significant country risk exposures, analyzing 
the potential direct and indirect impacts of various 
macroeconomic and capital market scenarios.  
At December 31, 2011, foreign loans represented 
approximately 5% of our total consolidated loans outstanding 

and approximately 3% of our total assets. Our largest foreign 

country exposure on an ultimate risk basis was the United 
Kingdom, which amounted to approximately $11.0 billion, or 
0.84%, of our consolidated assets, and included $1.7 billion of 
sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom sovereign claims arise 
primarily from deposits we ha
ve placed with the Bank of 
England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our 
London branch. 
Several European countries have been experiencing 
significant fiscal and economic deterioration in recent months. 

In January 2012, Standard & Poor™s 
Ratings Service (S&P) 
downgraded the long-term sovereign debt ratings of France, 
Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal, Austria, Malta, Slovakia and 

Slovenia, as well as the rating of
 the European Financial Stability 
Facility
. In addition, in February 2012, Moody™s Investors 
Service lowered the sovereign debt ratings of Italy, Malta, 

Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain, and Fitch Ratings and 
S&P downgraded Greece to the lowest rating above a default. At 
December 31, 2011, our exposure to these downgraded countries, 
including cross-border claims on
 an ultimate risk basis, and 
foreign exchange and derivative products, aggregated 
approximately $3.4 billion, including $182.3 million of sovereign 
claims.  
Based on our most recent stress testing activities conducted 
in fourth quarter 2011, in the ev
ent of a rapid deterioration in 
financial and economic conditions in Europe we believe it is 
unlikely we would experience a material impact to our financial 

condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources as 

a result of our European exposures due to the relatively small 

magnitude of our exposures as well as its diversity by country, 

type, and counterparty. 
Table 22 provides information regarding our exposures to 
European sovereign entities and 
institutions located within such 
countries, including cross-border claims on an ultimate risk 
basis, and foreign exchange and derivative products.

impairment allowance and collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements.  
(2)

counterparty netting adjustments and reduced by the amount of cash collateral. It includes credit default swaps (CDS) predomi
nantly used to manage our U.S. and London
-based cash credit trading businesses, which sometimes results in selling and pur
chasing protection on the identical reference entity. Generally, we do not use market 
instruments such as CDS to hedge the credit risk of our investment or loan positions, although we do use them to manage risk 
in our trading businesses. At 
December
 31, 2011, the gross notional amount of our CDS sold on reference assets domiciled in Europe was substantially offset by the no
tional of CDS purchased from 
investment-grade counterparties. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, we did not have any net exposure on sovereign CDS associat
ed with European countries. 
(5) 
Total non-sovereign exposure is comprised of $12.3 billion exposure to financial institutions and $14.3 billion to non-financia
l corporations at December 31, 2011. 
(6) 
Includes non-sovereign exposure to Greece and Portugal in the 
amount of $9.5 million and $ 49.1 million, respectively. We had n
o sovereign debt exposure to these 
countries at December 31, 2011. 
                                          REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY MORTGAGE LOANS
  Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans primarily include loans we have made to 
customers and retained as part of our asset liability management 
strategy. These loans also include the Pick-a-Pay portfolio 

acquired from Wachovia and the home equity portfolio, which 
are discussed later in this Report. In addition, these loans 
include other purchased loans and loans included on our balance 
sheet due to the adoption of co
nsolidation accounting guidance 
related to VIEs.   
 Our underwriting and periodic review of loans collateralized 
by residential real property includes appraisals or estimates 
from automated valuation models
 (AVMs) to support property 
values. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate the 

market value of homes. AVMs are a lower-cost alternative to 
appraisals and support valuations of large numbers of properties 
in a short period of time using market comparables and price 

trends for local market areas. Th
e primary risk associated with 
the use of AVMs is that the valu
e of an individual property may 
vary significantly from the aver
age for the market area. We have 
processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk 
management guidelines addressing the circumstances when 
AVMs may be used. AVMs are gene
rally used in underwriting to 
support property values on loan originations only where the loan 
amount is under $250,000. We 
generally require property 
visitation appraisals by a qualified independent appraiser for 
larger residential property loans.  
 Some of our real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loans include an interest-only feature as part of the 

loan terms. These interest-only loans were approximately 21% of 
total loans at December 31, 2011,
 and 25% at December 31, 2010. 
Substantially all of these interest
-only loans at origination were 
considered to be prime or near prime.  

 We believe we have manageable adjustable-rate mortgage 

(ARM) reset risk across our owned mortgage loan portfolios. We 
do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate 

mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly 
referred to within the financia
l services industry as negative 
amortizing mortgage loans. Our liquidating option ARM 
portfolio was acquired from Wachovia. 
 We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
to assist homeowners and ot
her borrowers in the current 
difficult economic cycle. Loans ar
e underwritten at the time of 
the modification in accordance 
with underwriting guidelines 
established for governmental and proprietary loan modification 

programs. As a participant in 
the U.S. Treasury™s Making Home 
Affordable (MHA) programs, we are focused on helping 

customers stay in their homes. The MHA programs create a 

standardization of modification terms including incentives paid 
to borrowers, servicers, and investors. MHA includes the Home 
Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) for first lien loans and 

the Second Lien Modification Program (2MP) for junior lien 
loans. Under both our proprietary programs and the MHA 
programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate 

reductions, forbearance of prin
cipal, and in some cases, 
principal forgiveness. These pr
ograms generally include trial 
payment periods of three to four months, and after successful 

completion and compliance with terms during this period, the 
loan is permanently modified. During both the trial payment 
period and/or permanent modification period, the loan is 

accounted for as a TDR loan. See Table 32 for discussion on trial 
modifications, including balances. See Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for discussion on how we determine the allowance 
attributable to our modified resi
dential real estate portfolios. 
The concentrations of real esta
te 1-4 family first and junior 
lien mortgage loans by state are presented in Table 23. Our real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to borrowers in California 

represented approximately 13% of total loans (3% of this amount 
53Risk Management 
Š Credit Risk Management 
(continued) 
 were PCI loans from Wachovia) at December 31, 2011, mostly 
within the larger metropolitan areas, with no single California 

metropolitan area consisting of 
more than 3% of total loans. We 
continuously monitor changes in real estate values and 
underlying economic or market conditions for all geographic 
areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio as part of 
our credit risk management process. 
Part of our credit monitoring 
includes tracking delinquency, 
FICO scores and collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire real 

estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio. These metrics 

experienced improvement throughout 2011, on the non-PCI 
mortgage portfolio, with the majority of the improvement 
occurring in the first half of 2011. Loans 30 days or more 

delinquent at December 31, 2011, totaled $18.4 billion, or 6%, of 
total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $20.3 billion, or 7%, at 
December 31, 2010. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 

totaled $44.1 billion at December 
31, 2011, or 15% of all non-PCI 
mortgages, compared with $50.7 billion, or 17%, at 

December 31, 2010. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 
100% totaled $74.2 billion at December 31, 2011, or 26% of total 
non-PCI mortgages, compared with $84.9 billion, or 29%, at 

December 31, 2010. Information re
garding credit risk trends can 
be found in Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to

 PICK-A-PAY PORTFOLIO
  The Pick-a-Pay portf
olio was one of the 
consumer residential first mortgage
 portfolios we acquired from 
Wachovia and a majority of the portfolio was identified as PCI 
loans. The Pick-a-Pay portfolio is
 a liquidating portfolio, as 
Wachovia ceased originating ne
w Pick-a-Pay loans in 2008. 
 The Pick-a-Pay portfolio incl
udes loans that offer payment 
options (Pick-a-Pay option payment loans), and also includes 

loans that were originated with
out the option payment feature, 
loans that no longer offer the option feature as a result of our 
modification efforts since the ac
quisition, and loans where the 
customer voluntarily converted to a fixed-rate product. The Pick-
a-Pay portfolio is included in the 
consumer real estate 1-4 family 
first mortgage class of loans thro
ughout this Report. Real estate 
1-4 family junior lien mortgages and lines of credit associated 
with Pick-a-Pay loans are reported
 in the home equity portfolio. 
Table 24 provides balances over
 time related to the types of 
loans included in the portfolio since acquisition.

    PCI loans in the Pick-a-Pay po
rtfolio had an adjusted unpaid 
principal balance of $36.9 billion and a carrying value of 
$29.1 billion at December 31, 2011.
 The carrying value of the PCI 
loans is net of remaining purchase accounting write-downs, 
which reflected their fair value at acquisition. At acquisition, we 
recorded a $22.4 billion write-down in purchase accounting on 

Pick-a-Pay loans th
at were impaired. 
 Pick-a-Pay option payment loans may be adjustable or fixed 

rate. They are home mortgages on which the customer has the 

option each month to select from among four payment options: 
(1) a minimum payment as described below, (2) an interest-only 
payment, (3) a fully amortizing 15-year payment, or (4) a fully 

amortizing 30-year payment. 
 The minimum monthly payment for substantially all of our 
Pick-a-Pay loans is reset annually. The new minimum monthly 
payment amount usually cannot increase by more than 7.5% of 
the then-existing principal and interest payment amount. The 
minimum payment may not be sufficient to pay the monthly 

interest due and in those situations a loan on which the 
customer has made a minimum payment is subject to ﬁnegative 
amortization,ﬂ where unpaid intere
st is added to the principal 
balance of the loan. The amount of
 interest that has been added 
to a loan balance is referred to as ﬁdeferred interest.ﬂ Total 

deferred interest of $2.0 billion
 at December 31, 2011, was down 

from $2.7 billion at December 31
, 2010, due to loan modification 
efforts as well as interest rates remaining low,
 resulting in the 
minimum payment option covering the interest and some 

principal on many loans. Approximately 83% of the Pick-a-Pay 
customers making a minimum payment in December 2011 did 
not defer interest, compared with 75% in December 2010. 
 Deferral of interest on a Pick-a-Pay loan may continue as 
long as the loan balance remains below a pre-defined principal 

cap, which is based on the perc
entage that the current loan 
balance represents to the original loan balance. Loans with an 

original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio equal to or below 85% have a 

cap of 125% of the original loan balance, and these loans 
represent substantially all the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Loans with 
an original LTV ratio above 85% have a cap of 110% of the 
original loan balance. Most of the Pick-a-Pay loans on which 

there is a deferred interest ba
lance re-amortize (the monthly 
payment amount is reset or ﬁrecas
tﬂ) on the earlier of the date 
when the loan balance reaches its 
principal cap, or the 10-year 
anniversary of the loan. For a small population of Pick-a-Pay 

loans, the recast occurs at the five-year anniversary. After a 

recast, the customers™ new pa
yment terms are reset to the 
amount necessary to repay the balance over the rest of the 

original loan term. 

 Due to the terms of the Pick-a-P
ay portfolio, there is little 
recast risk in the near term. Base
d on assumptions of a flat rate 
environment, if all eligible customers elect the minimum 

payment option 100% of the time
 and no balances prepay, we 
would expect the following balances of loans to recast based on 

reaching the principal cap: $7 million in 2012, $22 million in 

2013 and $81 million in 2014. In 2011, $3 million was recast 
based on reaching the principal ca
p. In addition, in a flat rate 
environment, we would expect the following balances of loans to 
start fully amortizing due to reaching their recast anniversary 
date and also having a payment ch
ange at the recast date greater 
than the annual 7.5% reset: $47 
million in 2012, $100 million in 
2013 and $373 million in 2014
. In 2011, the amount of loans 
reaching their recast anniversary date and also having a payment 
change over the annual 7.5% reset was $7 million. 

 Table 25 reflects the geograph
ic distribution of the Pick-a-
Pay portfolio broken out between PCI loans and all other loans. 

In stressed housing markets wi
th declining home prices and 
increasing delinquencies, the LT
V ratio is a useful metric in 
predicting future real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loan 

performance, including potential charge-offs. Because PCI loans 

were initially recorded at fair value, including write-downs for 
expected credit losses, the rati
o of the carrying value to the 
current collateral value will be
 lower compared with the LTV 
ratio based on the adjusted un
paid principal balance. For 
informational purposes, we have
 included both ratios for PCI 
loans in the following table.

Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other ind
ications of severe borrower financial 
stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan. 
  (3) 
The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values
 are generally determined using automated 
valuation models (AVM) and are u
pdated quarterly. AVMs are computer
-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of 
market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.  
  (4) 
Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which
, for PCI loans may include the 
nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans,
 an adjustment to mark the loans to a market 
yield at date of merger less any subsequent 
charge-offs. 
  (5) The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.  
                               To maximize return and allow flexibility for customers to 
avoid foreclosure, we have in place several loss mitigation 
strategies for our Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio. We contact 
customers who are experiencing financial difficulty and may in 

certain cases mo
dify the terms of a loan based on a customer™s 
documented income and other circumstances. 

 We also have taken steps to wo
rk with customers to refinance 
or restructure their Pick-a-Pay 
loans into other loan products. 
For customers at risk, we offer co
mbinations of term extensions 

of up to 40 years (from 30 years), interest rate reductions, 

forbearance of principal, and, 
in geographies with substantial 
property value declines, we may offer permanent principal 

forgiveness. 

 In 2011, we completed more than 19,000 proprietary and 
HAMP Pick-a-Pay loan modifications and have completed more 
than 99,000 modifications since the Wachovia acquisition, 

resulting in $4.0 billion of principal forgiveness to our Pick-a-
Pay customers as well as an additional $516 million of 

conditional forgiveness that can 
be earned by borrowers through 
performance over the next three years. As announced in 

October 2010, we entered into agreements with certain state 
attorneys general whereby we agreed to offer loan modifications 

to eligible Pick-a-Pay custom
ers through June 2013. These 
agreements cover the majority of our option payment loan 

portfolio and require that we offer modifications (both HAMP 
and proprietary) to eligible cu
stomers with the option payment 
loan product. In response to these agreements, we developed an 
enhanced proprietary modificati
on product that allows for 
various means of principal forgiveness along with changes to 

other loan terms. Given that these agreements cover all 
modification efforts to eligible customers for the applicable 
states, our modifications (both HAMP and proprietary) for our 
Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio performed in 2011 were primarily 
consistent with these agreements.
   Due to better than expected 
performance observed on the 
Pick-a-Pay portfolio compared 
with the original acquisition 
estimates, we have reclassi
fied $2.4 billion from the 
nonaccretable difference to the a
ccretable yield since acquisition. 
This performance is primaril
y attributable to significant 
modification efforts as well as the portfolio
™s delinquency 
stabilization. The resulting increa
se in the accretable yield will 
be realized over the remaining life of the portfolio, which is 
estimated to have a weighted-average life of approximately 
11 years at December 31, 2011. Th
e accretable yield percentage at 
the end of 2011 was 4.45%, down from 4.54% at the end of 2010. 
Fluctuations in the accretable yi
eld are driven by changes in 
interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, prepayment 
assumptions, and expected principal and interest payments over 
the estimated life of the portfolio, which will be affected by the 
pace and degree of improvemen
ts in the U.S. economy and 
housing markets and projected
 lifetime performance resulting 
from loan modification activity. 
Changes in the projected timing 
of cash flow events, including loan liquidations, modifications 

and short sales, can also affect 
the accretable yield percentage 
and the estimated weighted-avera
ge life of the portfolio. 
 56  HOME EQUITY PORTFOLIOS
  Our home equity portfolios
 consist 
of real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages and first and 
junior lines of credit secured by real estate. Our first lien lines of 
credit represent 20% of our home equity portfolio and are 
included in real estate 1-4 family first mortgages. The majority of 
our junior lien loan products are amortizing payment loans with 
fixed interest rates and repayment periods between 5 to 30 

years. Junior lien loans with ba
lloon payments at the end of the 
repayment term represent a small portion of our junior lien 
loans. 

 Our first and junior lien lines of credit products generally 
have a draw period of 10 years with variable interest rates and 
payment options during the draw period of (1) interest only or 

(2) 1.5% of total outstanding ba
lance. During the draw period, 
the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the 
line from a variable interest ra
te to a fixed rate with terms 
including interest-only payments for a fixed period between 
three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed 
period between five to 30 years. 
At the end of the draw period, a 
line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment loan 

with repayment terms of up to 30
 years based on the balance at 
time of conversion. The draw periods for a majority of our lines 
of credit end after 2015. 
  We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 
junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of loss. We have observed 
that the severity of loss for junior lien mortgages is high and 
generally not affected by whether we or a third party own or 
service the related first mortgage
, but that the frequency of loss 
is lower when we own or service 
the first mortgage. In general, 
we have limited information avai
lable on the delinquency status 
of the third party owned or servic
ed senior lien where we also 
have a junior lien. To capture this inherent loss content, we use 

the experience of our junior lien mortgages behind delinquent 
first liens that are owned or servic
ed by us adjusted for observed 
higher delinquency rates associated with junior lien mortgages 
behind third party first mortgages.
 We incorporate this inherent 
loss content into our allowance for loan losses. During 2011 we 

refined our allowance process for junior liens to ensure 

appropriate consideration of the 
relative difference in loss 
experience for junior liens behind first lien mortgage loans we 

own or service, compared with those behind first lien mortgage 
loans owned or serviced by third 
parties. In addition, we refined 
our allowance process for junior li
ens that are curr
ent, but are in 
their revolving period, to more appropriately reflect the inherent 

loss where the borrower is delinquent on the corresponding first 
lien mortgage loans. The impact of these revisions was not 

significant to our allowance. Ta
ble 26 summarizes delinquency 
and loss rates by the holder of the lien.

(continued) 
 We also monitor the number of borrowers paying the 
minimum amount due on a monthly basis. In December 2011, 
approximately 94% of our borrowers with home equity 
outstanding balances paid at
 least the minimum amount due, 
which included 46% of our borrowers paying only the minimum 
amount due.  
The home equity liquidating portfolio includes home equity 
loans generated through third party channels, including 

correspondent loans. This liquidating portfolio represents less 
than 1% of our total loans outstanding at December 31, 2011, and 

contains some of the highest risk
 in our home equity portfolio, 
with a loss rate of 9.36% compared with 3.02% for the core (non-

liquidating) home equity portfolio. Table 27 shows the credit 

attributes of the core and liquid
ating home equity portfolios and 
lists the top five states by outs
tanding balance. California loans 
represent the largest state conc
entration in each of these 
portfolios. The decrease in ou
tstanding balances primarily 
reflects loan paydowns and charge-o
ffs. As of December 31, 2011, 
36% of the outstanding balance of
 the core home equity portfolio 
was associated with loans that had a combined loan to value 

(CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%
. CLTV means the ratio of the 
total loan balance of first mortgages and junior lien mortgages 
(including unused line amounts for credit line products) to 
property collateral value. The unsecured portion of the 

outstanding balances of these loans (the outstanding amount 
that was in excess of the most re
cent property collateral value) 
totaled 17% of the core home equity portfolio at 
December 31, 2011.

58  NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS (NPAs)
 Table 
28 shows the five-yea
r trend for NPAs and Table 29 summarizes 
NPAs for each of the four quarters of 2011. We generally place 
loans on nonaccrual status when:  
 the full and timely collection of interest or principal 
becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower™s financial condition and the adequacy of 

collateral, if any);  
 they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 

family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest 
or principal, unless both well
-secured and in the process of 
collection; or 
 part of the principal balance has been charged off and no 
restructuring has occurred.

Other outflows include the effects of VIE deconsolidations and adjustments for loans carried at fair value.  
                     Typically, changes to nonaccr
ual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that reach a specified past due 
status, offset by reductions for 
loans that are charged off, sold, 
transferred to foreclosed properti
es, or are no longer classified 
as nonaccrual as a result of 
continued performance and an 
improvement in the borrower™s financial con
dition and loan 
repayment capabilities.  

 While nonaccrual loans are no
t free of loss content, we 
believe the estimated loss exposure remaining in these 

balances is significantly mitigated by four factors. First, 99% of 

consumer nonaccrual loans and 96% of commercial nonaccrual 
loans are secured. Of the $13.1 
billion of consumer nonaccrual 
loans at December 31, 2011, 99% 
are secured by real estate and 
36% have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or below. 

Second, losses have already been recognized on 51% of the 
remaining balance of consumer nonaccruals and commercial 
nonaccruals have been written down by $2.1 billion. Generally, 
when a consumer real estate loan is 120 days past due, we 

transfer it to nonaccrual st
atus. When the loan reaches 
180 days past due it is our policy to write these loans down to 

net realizable value (fair value of
 collateral less estimated costs 

to sell), except for modifications 
in their trial period that are not written down as long as tr
ial payments are made on time. 
Thereafter, we revalue each loan regularly and recognize 

additional write-downs if needed. Third, as of 
December 31, 2011, 58% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on interest. Fourth, the 
risk of loss for all nonaccruals 
has been considered and we beli
eve is appropriately covered by 
the allowance for loan losses. 
Under both our proprietary modification programs and the 
MHA programs, customers may be required to provide 

updated documentation, and some programs require 
completion of trial payment periods to demonstrate sustained 
performance, before the loan can be removed from nonaccrual 

status. In addition, for loans in foreclosure, many states, 
including California, Florida and New Jersey, have enacted 
legislation that significantly 
increases the time frames to 
complete the foreclosure process, meaning that loans will 
remain in nonaccrual status for longer periods. 
If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that 
were, but are no longer on nona
ccrual at year end) had been 
accrued under the original terms, approximately $1.1 billion of 
interest would have been recorded as income on these loans, 
compared with $344 million actually recorded as interest 
income in 2011 versus $1.3 billion and $362 million, 

respectively, in 2010. 
 Table 31 provides a summary of foreclosed assets and an 
analysis of the changes.

Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate securing government insured/guaranteed loans is class
ified as nonperforming. Both principal and 
interest for government insured/guaranteed loans secured by the foreclosed real estate are collectible because the loans are in
sured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 
(2) 
Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily tr
ansferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement i
s received from FHA or VA. The net change 
in government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets is made up of inflows from MHFI and MHFS, and outflows when we are reimburse
d by FHA/VA. 
                       NPAs at December 31, 2011, included $1.3 billion of 
foreclosed real estate that is FHA insured or VA guaranteed 
and expected to have little to no loss content, and $3.3 billion 

of foreclosed assets, which have been written down to 
estimated net realizable value. Foreclosed assets decreased 
$1.3 billion, or 22%, in 2011 from December 31, 2010. Of this 
decrease, $730 million were foreclosed loans from the PCI 
portfolio. At December 31, 2011, 74% of our foreclosed assets of 

$4.7 billion have been in the foreclosed assets portfolio one 

year or less. Given our real esta
te-secured loan concentrations 
and current economic conditions, we anticipate we will 

continue to hold a high level of NPAs on our balance sheet.  
We process foreclosures on a 
regular basis for the loans we 
service for others as well as thos
e we hold in our loan portfolio. 
We use foreclosure, however, only as a last resort for dealing 

with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. We employ 
extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to 
find other solutions for our borrowers. We maintain 
appropriate staffing in our workout and collection teams to 
ensure troubled borrowers rece
ive appropriate attention and 

assistance.

(1) Amounts reported for June 30 and March 31, 2011, have been revised to reflect the retrospective adoption from the beginning of 
2011 during third quarter 2011 of 
ASU 2011-02, which provides guidance under what circumstances a restructured loan should be classified as a TDR. The impact of ado
pting ASU 2011-02 increased total 
commercial TDRs by $1.5 billion and $793 million at June 30 and March 31, 2011, respectively. 
(2) 
Based on clarifying guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received in December 2011, we classify trial mod
ifications as TDRs at the beginning of the 
trial period. For many of our consumer real estate modification programs, we may require a borrower to make trial payments ge
nerally for a period 
of three to four months. 
Prior to the SEC clarification, we classified trial modifications as TDRs once a borrower successfully completed the trial peri
od in accordance with the terms. 
                       Table 32 provides information regarding the recorded 
investment of loans modified in TDRs. It reflects the 

retrospective adoption from the beginning of 2011 of  
ASU 2011-2, which provided additional guidance for classifying 
modifications as TDRs. This new guidance specifically clarifies, 
among other things, the definition of a concession, including 
how to evaluate modified loan terms against terms that would be 
commensurate for loans with similar credit risk. For our 

commercial loan modifications, we do not typically modify 
principal through forgiveness or forbearance or reduce the 
contractual interest rate. In fact, 
in many cases, we obtain higher 
rates of interest, additional collateral or guarantor support, or 
other improvements to the terms. Certain commercial loan 
modifications are now classified as TDRs under the clarified 

guidance. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was 
$5.2 billion and $3.9 billion at
 December 31, 2011 and 2010, 
respectively. See Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for more information.  
 We do not forgive principal for a majority of our TDRs, but in 
those situations where principal is
 forgiven, the entire amount of 
such principal forgiveness is 
immediately charged off to the 
extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes 

delay the timing on the repaym
ent of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance) and charge off the amount of 

forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible. 
  Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan 
types when a restructuring is involved. We underwrite loans at 
the time of restructuring to dete
rmine whether there is sufficient 
evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the 
borrower™s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other 
factors. Loans lacking sufficient evidence of sustained repayment 
capacity at the time of modificati
on are charged down to the fair 
value of the collateral, if applic
able. For an accruing loan that 
has been modified, if the 
borrower has demonstrated 

performance under the previous terms and the underwriting 
process shows the capacity to 
continue to perform under the 
restructured terms, the loan will remain in accruing status. 
Otherwise, the loan will be placed
 in nonaccrual status until the 
borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, 
generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, 
inclusive of consecutive paymen
ts made prior to modification. 
Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual, and a corresponding 

charge-off is recorded to the loan
 balance, if we believe that 
principal and interest contractually due under the modified 

agreement will not be collectible.

Net change in trial modifications is made up of inflows of new TDRs entering trial payment period, and outflows of modification
s that successfully perform and enter into a 
permanent modification or do not perform according to the te
rms of the trial period plan, and as a result are charged
-off or moved to foreclosure. Our recent experience is 
that most of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing the program requirements. 
                    64  LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING
  Loans 90 days or more past due 
as to interest 
or principal are 
still accruing if they are (1) we
ll-secured and in the process of 
collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or 
consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until late
r delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans of $8.7 billion
, $11.6 billion and $16.1 billion 
at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are excluded 

from this disclosure even thou
gh they are 90 days or more 
contractually past due. These PC
I loans are considered to be 
accruing due to the existence of
 the accretable yield and not 
based on consideration given to contractual interest payments. 
 Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more 

past due and still accruing at 
December 31, 2011, were down 
$601 million, or 23%, from December 31, 2010. The decline was 

due to loss mitigation activiti
es including modifications and 
increased collection capacity
/process improvements, charge-
offs, lower early stage delinquency levels and credit stabilization. 
Loans 90 days or more past 
due and still accruing whose 
repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of 
Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education 

Loan Program were $20.5 billion at December 31, 2011, up from 
$15.8 billion at December 31, 20
10, due primarily to growth in 
the FHA/VA portfolio over the past two years and the 
subsequent seasoning of those loans. 
 Table 34 reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due and

insured/guaranteed. For additional information on

full year of 2011 and 2010. Net charge-offs in 2011 were 
$11.3 billion (1.49% of average total loans outstanding) 
compared with $17.8 billion (2.30%) in 2010. Total net charge-
offs decreased in 2011 due in part to modestly improving 
economic conditions, aggressive 
loss mitigation activities aimed 
at working with our customers through their financial 
challenges, and a runoff of th
e pool of the most challenged 
vintages/relationships in the portfolio. Total net charge-offs 

decreased in each of the first thre
e quarters of the year and were 
essentially flat in fourth quarter 2011. 
 Net charge-offs in the 1-4 f
amily first mortgage portfolio 
totaled $3.5 billion in 2011, compared with $4.4 billion a year 

ago. 
  Net charge-offs in the real 
estate 1-4 family junior lien 
portfolio decreased $1.2 billion to $3.5 billion in 2011. More 
information about the home eq
uity portfolio, which includes 
substantially all of our real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage 
loans, is available in Table 27 
in this Report and the related 
discussion. 

 Credit card charge-offs decreased $980 million to 

$1.2 billion in 2011. Delinquency levels stabilized and loss levels 
continued to improve in 2011 as
 the economy showed signs of 
stabilization. 
 Commercial net charge-offs were $2.0 billion in 2011 
compared with $4.8 billion in 2010, as market liquidity and 
improving market conditions helped stabilize performance 

results. 
 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
  The allowance for credit 
losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance 
for unfunded credit commitments, is management™s 
estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans carried at fair valu
e. The detail of the changes in 
the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including 
charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

 We employ a disciplined process and methodology to 
establish our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This 
process takes into consideration many factors, including 

historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality 
ratings and loan grade-specific loss factors. The process involves 
subjective as well as complex judgments. In addition, we review 

a variety of credit metrics and trends. These trends, however, do 
not solely determine the appropriate allowance amount as we 
use several analytical tools. For 
additional information on our 
allowance for credit losses, se
e the ﬁCritical Accounting Policies 
Œ Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ section and Note 6 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 
 We believe the allowance for cred
it losses of $19.7 billion at 
December 31, 2011, was appropriate to cover credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at December 31, 2011. The allowance for credit 

losses is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the 

date of determination, including
 economic or market conditions 
and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due 

to the sensitivity of the allowanc
e for credit losses to changes in 
the business environment, it is possible that we will incur 
incremental credit losses not anti
cipated as of the balance sheet 
date. In addition to the allowan
ce for credit losses there was 
$10.7 billion and $13.4 billion of nonaccretable difference at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to absorb losses for 

PCI loans.  
 As a result of PCI accounting, the book value of high risk 
loans was written down at the time
 of acquisition. Therefore, the 
allowance for credit losses is lower than otherwise would have 
been required without PCI loan accounting and certain ratios of 
the Company may not be directly 
comparable with periods prior 
to the Wachovia merger or with 
credit-related ratios of other 
financial institutions. For additional information on PCI loans, 
see the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Management 
Œ Purchased Credit-
Impaired Loansﬂ section and Note
 6 (Loans 
and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

 The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total 
nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to 
period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the 

portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and 
marketability of collateral. Over half of nonaccrual loans were 
home mortgages, auto and other consumer loans at 
December 31, 2011.  
67Risk Management 
Š Credit Risk Management 
(continued) 
  The $3.7 billion decline in the allowance for loan losses in 
2011 reflected the release of al
lowance due to lower levels of 
inherent credit loss in the port
folio compared with prior year-
end levels. Total provision for credit losses was $7.9 billion in 
2011, $15.8 billion in 2010 and $21.7 billion in 2009. The 2011 
provision was $3.4 billion less than net charge-offs. Primary 
drivers of the 2011 provision 
reduction were decreased net 
charge-offs and continued improvem
ent in the credit quality of 
the commercial and consumer portfolios and related loss 

estimates as seen in declining delinquency and nonperforming 

loan levels. Absent significant de
terioration in the economy, we 
expect future allowance releases in 2012, although at more 

modest levels. 

 In 2010, the provision of $15.8 billion was $2.0 billion less 
than net charge-offs. The re
duction in the provision was 
primarily due to continued improvement in the consumer 
portfolios and related loss estimates and improvement in 
economic conditions. These drivers were partially offset by an 
increase in impaired loans and related allowance primarily 
associated with increased consumer loan modification efforts 
and a $693 million addition to th
e allowance due to adoption of 
consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010. 
  In 2009, the provision of $21.7 billion was $3.5 billion 
greater than net charge-offs. 
Primary drivers of the 2009 
provision were deterioration in
 economic conditions that 
increased the projected losses in our commercial portfolios, 
additional allowance associated with loan modification 
programs designed to keep qualif
ying borrowers in their homes, 
and the establishment of additional allowance for PCI loans. 
 In determining the appropriat
e allowance attributable to our 
residential real estate portfoli
os, the loss rates used in our 
analysis include the impact of our established loan modification 

programs. When modifications occu
r or are probable to occur, 
our allowance considers the impa
ct of these modifications, 
taking into consideration the asso
ciated credit cost, including re-
defaults of modified loans and projected loss severity. The loss 
content associated with existing and probable loan modifications 
has been considered in our al
lowance reserving methodology. 
 Changes in the allowance refl
ect changes in statistically 
derived loss estimates, historical
 loss experience, current trends 
in borrower risk and/or general economic activity on portfolio 
performance, and management™s estimate for imprecision and 
uncertainty, including ongoing discussions with regulatory and 

government agencies regarding mortgage foreclosure-related 
matters.  Table 36 presents an analysis of the allowance for credit 

losses by loan segments and classes for the last five years.

 LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES
 We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 
(GSEs) who include the mortga
ge loans in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private label MBS, 

and (3) other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans 
for investment or private label 
securitization. In addition, we 
pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans that back 
securities guaranteed by GNMA. We may be required to 
repurchase these mortgage loans
, indemnify the securitization 
trust, investor or insurer, or re
imburse the securitization trust, 
investor or insurer for cred
it losses incurred on loans 
(collectively ﬁrepurchaseﬂ) in the event of a breach of contractual 
representations or warranties that is not remedied within a 
period (usually 90 days or less
) after we receive notice of the 
breach.  We have established a mortgage repurchase liability related 
to various representations an
d warranties that reflect 
management™s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a 
repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service those 
loans, based on a combination of factors. Our mortgage 

repurchase liability estimation
 process also incorporates a 
forecast for repurchase demands associated with mortgage 

insurance rescission activity. 
Currently, repurchase demands 
primarily relate to 2006 through 2008 vintages and to GSE-
guaranteed MBS. 
  During 2011, we continued to experience elevated levels of 
repurchase activity measured by the number of investor 
repurchase demands and our level of repurchases. We 
repurchased or reimbursed investors for incurred losses on 
mortgage loans with original balances of $2.8 billion in 2011, 
compared with $2.6 billion in 2010. Additionally, we negotiated 
settlements on pools of mortgage loans with original sold 

balances of $341 million in 2011,
 compared with $675 million in 
2010, to eliminate the risk of
 repurchase on these loans.
 We incurred net losses on repurchased loans, investor 
reimbursements and loan pool global settlements totaling 
$1.2 billion in 2011, compared with $1.4 billion in 2010. 
Table 37 provides the number of unresolved repurchase 
demands and mortgage insurance rescissions. We do not 

typically receive repurchase requests from GNMA, FHA/HUD or 
VA. As an originator of an FHA insured or VA guaranteed loan, 

we are responsible for obtaining 
the insurance with FHA or the 
guarantee with the VA. To the exte
nt we are not able to obtain 
the insurance or the guarantee we must request to repurchase 
the loan from the GNMA pool. Such repurchases from GNMA 
pools typically represent a self-initiated process upon discovery 

of the uninsurable loan (usually wi
thin 180 days from funding of 
the loan). Alternatively, in lieu of repurchasing loans from 

GNMA pools, we may be asked by
 the FHA/HUD or the VA to 
indemnify them (as applicable) 
for defects found in the Post 
Endorsement Technical Review process or audits performed by 

FHA/HUD or the VA. Our liability for mortgage loan repurchase 

losses incorporates probable losses associated with such 

indemnification.

tively, received from investors on 
mortgage servicing rights acquired from other originators. We generally have the right of recourse against the seller and may
 be able to recover losses related to such 
repurchase demands subject to counterparty risk associated with the seller. 
(2) 
As part of our representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we typically represent to GSEs and private investors
 that certain loans have mortgage insurance to 
the extent there are loans that have loan to value ratios in excess of 80
% that require mortgage insurance. To the extent the mortgage insurance is rescinded by the 
mortgage insurer due to a claim of breach of a contractual representation or warranty, the lack of insurance may result in a 
repurchase demand from an investor. Sim
ilar to 
repurchase demands, we evaluate mortgage insurance rescission notices for validity and appeal for reinstatement if the rescis
sion was not based on a contractual breach. 
When investor demands are received due to lack of mortgage insu
rance, they are reported as unresolved repurchase demands based 
on the applicable investor category for 
the loan (GSE or private). Over the last year, approximately 20% of our repurchase demands from GSEs had mortgage insurance r
escission as one of the reasons for the 
rep
urchase demand. Of all the mortgage insurance rescissions notices received in 2010, approximately 70% have resulted in repurc
hase demands through December 2011. 
Not all mortgage insurance rescissions received in 2010 have been completed through the appeals
 process with the mortgage insurer and upon successful appeal, we work 
with the investor to rescind the repurchase demand.  
(3) 
While the original loan balances related to these demands are 
presented above, the establishment of the repurchase liability is
 based on a combination of factors, such as 
our appeals success rates, reimbursement by correspondent and other third
-party originators, and projected loss severity, which is driven by the difference between the 
current loan balance and the estimated collateral value less costs to sell the property. 
                                    70   The level of repurchase demands outstanding at 
December 31, 2011, was down from a year ago in both number of 

outstanding loans and in total dollar balances as we continued to 
work through the demands. Cust
omary with industry practice, 
we have the right of recourse ag
ainst correspondent lenders from 
whom we have purchased loans with respect to representations 
and warranties. Of total repurchase demands and mortgage 

insurance recissions outstanding as of December 31, 2011, 
presented in Table 37, approximately 20% relate to loans 
purchased from correspondent lenders. Due primarily to the 

financial difficulties of some correspondent lenders, we typically 
recover on average approximatel
y 50% of losses from these 
lenders. Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender 

performance are incorporated 
in the establishment of our 
mortgage repurchase liability. 

 Our liability for repurchases, included in ﬁAccrued expenses 
and other 
liabilitiesﬂ in our consolidated financial statements, 
was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. In 2011 

$1.3 billion of additions to the liability were recorded, which 
reduced net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities, 
compared with $1.6 billion in 2010. Our additions to the 

repurchase liability in 2011 and 2010 predominately reflect 
updated assumptions about probable future demands on prior 
vintages. This increase in ou
r estimate for probable future 
demands in 2011 was primarily due 
to an increase in repurchase 
demands from the GSEs on th
e 2006-2008 vintages with a 
higher than anticipated increase from the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (FNMA) in
 the latter half of 2011. 
  We believe we have a high quality residential mortgage loan 
servicing portfolio. Of the $1.8
 trillion in the residential 
mortgage loan servicing portfolio at December 31, 2011, 92% was 
current, less than 2% was subprime
 at origination, and less than 
1% was home equity securitizati
ons. Our combined delinquency 
and foreclosure rate on th
is portfolio was 7.96% at 
December 31, 2011, compared with
 8.02% at December 31, 2010. 
In this portfolio 5% are private label securitizations where we 
originated the loan and therefor
e have some repurchase risk. We 
believe the risk of repurchase in our private label securitizations 
is substantially reduced, relative to other private label 
securitizations, because approximat
ely half of this portfolio of 
private label securitizations that include our mortgage loans do 
not contain representations and warranties regarding borrower 
or other third party misrepresentations related to the mortgage 
loan, general compliance with underwriting guidelines, or 

property valuation, which are commonly asserted bases for 
repurchase. For this 5% private label securitization segment of 
our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio, 58% are loans 
from 2005 vintages or earlier (weighted average age of 
75 months); 79% were prime at origination; and approximately 

66% are jumbo loans. The weighted-average LTV as of 
December 31, 2011, for this priv
ate securitization segment was 
78%. We believe the highest risk
 segment of these private label 
securitizations is the subprime loans originated in 2006 and 

2007. These subprime loans ha
ve seller representations and 
warranties and currently have LTVs close to or exceeding 100%, 
and represent 9% of the 5% private label securitization portion of 

the residential mortgage servicing portfolio. We had only 
$110 million of repurchases related to private label 
securitizations in 2011. Of the servicing portfolio, 4% is non-

agency acquired servicing and 2% 
is private whole loan sales. We 
did not underwrite and securitize the non-agency acquired 

servicing and therefore we have no
 obligation on that portion of 
our servicing portfolio to the investor for any repurchase 

demands arising from origination practices. For the private 

whole loan segment, while we do have repurchase risk on these 
prior loan sales, less than 2% were subprime at origination and 
loans that were sold and subseque
ntly securitized are included in 
the private label securitization segment discussed above.

vestor demand and mortgage insurer practices, and changes in th
e financial stability of correspondent lenders. 
                           The mortgage repurchase liability of $1.3 billion at 
December 31, 2011, represents our 
best estimate of the probable 
loss that we may incur for 
various representations and 
warranties in the contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage 

loans. Because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses 
depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and 
other external conditions that may
 change over the life of the 
underlying loans, the level of the liability for mortgage loan 
repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires 
considerable management judgment. We maintain regular 

contact with the GSEs and other significant investors to monitor 
and address their repurchase de
mand practices and concerns. 
Because of the uncertainty in th
e various estimates underlying 
the mortgage repurchase liability,
 there is a range of losses in 
excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability that are 
reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss 

for representations and warranties does not represent a probable 
loss, and is based on currently available information, significant 
judgment, and a number of assu
mptions that are subject to 
change. The high end of this range of reasonably possible losses 
in excess of our recorded liability was $2.1 billion at 
December 31, 2011, and was determined based upon modifying 

the assumptions utilized in our best
 estimate of probable loss to 
reflect what we believe to be the 
high end of reasonably possible 
adverse assumptions. For additional information on our 

repurchase liability, see the ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ
 Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Lossesﬂ section and 

Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in 

this Report. 
 The repurchase liability is predominantly applicable to loans 
we originated and sold with representations and warranties. 

Most of these loans are included 
in our servicing portfolio. Our 
repurchase liability estimate 
involves consideration of many 
factors that influe
nce the key assumptions of what our 
repurchase volume may be and what loss on average we may 

incur. Those key assumptions and the sensitivity of the liability 

to immediate adverse changes in 
them at December 31, 2011, are 
presented in Table 39. For additional information about the 

range of loss that is reasonably po
ssible in excess of the recorded 
mortgage repurchase liability, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking 
Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

The average loss rate includes the impact of 
repurchased loans for which no loss is expected to be realized. 
                 To the extent that economic conditions and the housing 

market do not improve or future investor repurchase demands 

and appeals success rates differ 
from past experience, we could 
continue to have increased deman
ds and increased loss severity 
on repurchases, causing future 
additions to the repurchase 
liability. However, some of the 
underwriting standards that were 
permitted by the GSEs for confor
ming loans in the 2006 through 
2008 vintages, which significantly contributed to recent levels of 

repurchase demands, were tightened starting in mid to late 

2008. Accordingly, we do not expect a similar rate of repurchase 
requests from the 2009 and prospective vintages, absent 
deterioration in economic conditions or changes in investor 

behavior. 
 In October 2011, the Arizon
a Department of Insurance

PMI to provide mortgage insurance on certain loans originated 
and held in our portfolio. Additionally, PMI has provided 
mortgage insurance on loans orig
inated and sold to third-party 
investors. For loans sold to thir
d-party investors, there is no 
additional risk of repurchase loss to Wells Fargo associated with 

the deferred insurance claim amounts from PMI since this credit 
72  risk is owned by the investor in
 the loan. We also hold a small 
amount of residential mortgage-backed securities, which are 

backed by mortgages with a limited amount of insurance 
provided by PMI. Because the loans and securities held in our 
portfolios with PMI insurance support are limited in amount, we 
do not anticipate the deferred claim payments will result in a 
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
  RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  
In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master 

servicer of residential mortgage loans included in GSE-

guaranteed mortgage securitizations, FHA/VA/GNMA-

guaranteed mortgage securitizati
ons and private label mortgage 
securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by 
institutional investors. The following discussion summarizes the 

primary duties and requirements of servicing and related recent 

industry developments. 
 General Servicing Duties and Requirements
 The loans we service were originated by us or by other mortgage 
loan originators. As servicer, ou
r primary duties are typically to 
(1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance certain 
delinquent payments of principa
l and interest, (3) maintain and 
administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance 
policies relating to the mortgage loans, (4) maintain any 
required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance 

and administer escrow payments, (5) foreclose on defaulted 
mortgage loans or, to the extent
 consistent with the documents 
governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, 
such as loan modifications or short sales, and (6) for loans sold 
into private label securitizations,
 manage the foreclosed property 
through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of 
the mortgage loans by the servicer, (2) consult with each servicer 
and use reasonable efforts to ca
use the servicer to observe its 
servicing obligations, (3) prepare monthly distribution 
statements to security holders and, if required by the 
securitization documents, certain periodic reports required to be 

filed with the SEC, (4) if required by the securitization 
documents, calculate distributions and loss allocations on the 
mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax and information 

returns of the securitization trust, and (6) advance amounts 
required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform their 
advancing obligations. 

 Each agreement under which we
 act as servicer or master 
servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity 
and provides protection against 
expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with 
the specified standard. For example, most private label 

securitization agreements under which we act as servicer or 
master servicer typically provide 
that the servicer and the master servicer are entitled to indemn
ification by the securitization 
trust for taking action or refraini
ng from taking action in good 
faith or for errors in judg
ment. However, we are not 
indemnified, but rather are required to indemnify the 
securitization trustee, against any failure by us, as servicer or 

master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations or against 
any of our acts or omissions that involve wilful misfeasance, bad 
faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless 

disregard of, our duties. In addition, if we commit a material 

breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may 
be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a 
specified period following notice, which can generally be given 
by the securitization trustee or a 
specified percentage of security 
holders. Whole loan sale contracts under which we act as 
servicer generally include similar provisions with respect to our 
actions as servicer. The standards governing servicing in GSE-
guaranteed securitizations, and the possible remedies for 

violations of such standards, vary, and those standards and 
remedies are determined by serv
icing guides maintained by the 
GSEs, contracts between the GSEs
 and individual servicers and 
topical guides published by the GSEs from time to time. Such 

remedies could include indemnification or repurchase of an 
affected mortgage loan. 

 Foreclosure and Securitization Matters
 During fourth quarter 2010, we 
identified practices where the 
final steps relating to the executi
on of foreclosure affidavits, as 
well as some aspects of the 
notarization process were not 
adhered to. Any re-execution or redelivery of any documents in 
connection with foreclosures will 
involve costs that may not be 
legally or otherwise reimbursable to
 us to the extent they relate 
to securitized mortgage loans. Further, if the validity of any 

foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower, whether 
successfully or not, we may incur significant litigation costs, 

which may not be reimbursable to us
 to the extent they relate to 
securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if a court were to 
overturn a foreclosure due to errors or deficiencies in the 
foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower if the 

required process was not followed and such failure resulted in 
damages to the borrower. We could also have liability to a title 
insurer that insured the title to th
e property sold in foreclosure. 
Any such liabilities may not be reimbursable to us to the extent 

they relate to a securitized mortgage loan. 

 When we securitize mortgage lo
ans we have an obligation to 
deliver mortgage notes, assignments and other critical 

documents. Although we continue to believe that we delivered all 

documents in accordance with the requirements of each 
securitization involving our mortgage loans, if any required 
document with respect to a securitized mortgage loan sold by us 

is missing or materially defective, we would be obligated to cure 

the defect or to repurchase the loan. 

 To facilitate securitizations it is a common industry practice 

to record mortgages in the na
me of Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS). Attorneys general of most 

states have alleged that this common industry practice creates 

issues regarding whether a securiti
zation trust has good title to 
the mortgage loan. MERS is a company that acts as mortgagee of 

record and as nominee for the owner of the related mortgage 

note. When mortgages are assigned, such as between an 
originator and a securitization 
trust, the change is recorded 
electronically on a register maintained by MERS. The purpose of 
MERS is to save borrowers and lenders from having to record 
assignments of mortgages in county land offices each time 
ownership of the mortgage note 
is assigned. Although MERS has 
been in existence and used for man
y years, it has recently been 
73Risk Management 
Š Credit Risk Management 
(continued) 
 alleged by attorneys general that having a mortgagee of record 
that is different from the owner of the mortgage note ﬁbreaks the 

chain of titleﬂ and clouds the ow
nership of the loan. We do not 
believe that to be the case, and 
believe that the operative legal 
principle is that th
e ownership of a mortgage follows the 
ownership of the mortgage note, and that a securitization trust 
should have good title to a mortgage loan if the note is endorsed 

and delivered to it, regardless of
 whether MERS is the mortgagee 
of record or whether an assignment of mortgage is recorded to 

the trust. However, in order to fo
reclose on the mortgage loan, it 

may be necessary for an assign
ment of the mortgage to be 
completed by MERS to the trust, in order to comply with state 

law requirements governing fore
closure. Our practice is to 
obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to 
commencing the foreclosure process. 
 Consent Orders and Settlement in Principle
 In April 2011, the Board of Go
vernors of the Federal Reserve 
System (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC) issued Consent Orders 
that require us to correct 
deficiencies in our residential mortgage loan servicing and 
foreclosure practices that were 
identified by federal banking 
regulators in their fourth quarter 2010 review. The Consent 

Orders also require that we improve our servicing and 

foreclosure practices. We have 
already implemented many of the 
operational changes that will result from the expanded servicing 

responsibilities outlined in the Consent Orders. 

 On February 9, 2012, the OCC and FRB announced the 

imposition of civil money penalties of $83 million and 
$85 million, respectively, pursuant to the Consent Orders. These 
penalties will be satisfied through payments made under a 

separate simultaneous federal/state settlement in principle, 
announced on the same day, among the Department of Justice, 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the 
Department of the Treasury, the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Executive Office of the 

U.S. Trustee, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a task 
force of Attorneys General representing 49 states, Wells Fargo, 
and four other servicers related to investigations of mortgage 

industry servicing and foreclosur
e practices. While Oklahoma is 
not participating in the larger settlement, it is settling separately 

with the five servicers with a 
simplified agreement. Under the 
settlement in principle, the terms of which do not become final 
until approval of the settlement agreement by the U.S. District 

Court and execution of a consent order, which will be in effect 
for three and one-half years (subject to a trailing review period), 
we have agreed to the following programmatic commitments, 
consisting of three components totalling $5.3 billion: 

  Consumer Relief Program
  For qualified borrowers with 
financial hardship and a loan 
owned and serviced by Wells 

Fargo, a commitment to provide $3.4 billion in aggregate 
consumer relief and assistance programs, including 
expanded first and second mortgage modifications that 
broaden the use of principal reduction to help customers 
achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that 
includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of 

arrearages for unemployed borrowers, cash-for-keys 
payments to borrowers who voluntarily vacate properties, 
and ﬁanti-blightﬂ provisions designed 
to reduce the impact on 
communities of vacant properti
es. As of December 31, 2011, 
the expected impact of the Consumer Relief Program was 
covered in our allowance for credit losses and in the 
nonaccretable difference relating to our purchased credit-
impaired residential mortgage portfolio. 
 Refinance Program
  For qualified borrowers with little or 
negative equity in their home and a loan owned and serviced 

by Wells Fargo, an expanded first-lien refinance program 

commitment estimated to provide $900 million of aggregate 
payment relief over the life of the refinanced loans. The 
Refinance Program will not result in any current-period 

charge as its impact will be recognized over a period of years 
in the form of lower interest income as qualified borrowers 
benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under 

the program. 
 Foreclosure Assistance Payment
  $1 billion paid directly 
to the federal government and 
the participating states for 
their use to address the impact 
of foreclosure challenges as 
they see fit and which may include direct payments to 

consumers. As of December 31, 
2011, we had fully accrued for 
the Foreclosure Assistance Payment. 
 
 California (under a separate California Agreement) and 
Florida (under a separate Florida Agreement) will receive state-
specific sub-commitments totaling $1.95 billion and $1.0 billion, 

respectively, regarding the amount of Consumer Relief and 

Refinance Program benefits for these two states as a part of, and 
not in addition to, the overall commitment to all states for these 
two programs. 

 The amount of credit we will receive toward fulfilling our 
commitments under the Consumer Relief and Refinance 
Programs will be determined based upon the nature of the 
modification or other relief to the borrower, the characteristics 
of the loan and the timing of 
the modification or relief. The 
terms of the Consumer Relief and Refinance Programs as well as 
other servicing matters are discussed in more detail below.  
 
Consumer Relief Program 
The Consumer Relief Program allows for selection from a menu 
of various alternatives to me
et the $3.4 billion overall 
commitment, subject to servicer agreements, agreements with 
the U.S. Treasury, investor guidelines, mortgage or bond insurer 

requirements, or other applicable requirements, and is intended 
to provide assistance to eligible borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty. Eligible borrowers include borrowers who 
have a pre-modification LTV in excess of 100%. The settlement 

provides for various modification and assistance programs with 
varying levels of credits, minimums, and maximums that can be 
used to satisfy the overall commitment amount for different 

activities, primarily including: 
 first lien principal forgiveness 
for LTV less than or equal to 
175%: 100% credit (must constitute at least 30% of the 

Consumer Relief Program credits); 
 first lien principal forgiveness for LTV greater than 175%: 

50% credit for portion forgiven over 175% LTV; 
74   forgiveness of forbearance amounts on existing loan 
modifications 
Œ 40% credit; 
 earned forgiveness over no more than a 3 year period: 
85% credit for LTV less than or
 equal to 175%; 45% credit for 
forgiveness over 175% LTV; 
 second lien principal forgiveness: 90% credit for loans 
90 days or less delinquent; 50% credit for loans greater than 

90 but less than 180 days delinquent; 10% credit for loans 
180 days more delinquent. Subject to a number of 
requirements, servicers participating in the settlement will be 

obligated to implement second lien principal forgiveness on 
second mortgages it owns when another participating 
servicer reduces principal on a first mortgage via its 

proprietary non-HAMP modification programs (must 
constitute at least 60% of the Consumer Relief Program 
credits when combined with
 the first lien principal 
forgiveness credits); 
 deficiency balance waivers on first and second lien loans: 

10% credit; 
 short sale deficiency balance waivers on first and second lien 

loans: 20% to 100% credit depending on whether the 

servicer, servicer/lien holder 
or investor incurs the loss; 
 payment arrearages forgiveness for unemployed borrowers: 

100% credit; 
 transitional funds paid to home
owners in connection with a 
short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for payments in 

excess of $1,500: 45% credit if a non-GSE investor bears the 

cost or 100% if the servicer bears the cost;  
 anti-blight 
Œ forgiveness of principal associated with 
properties where foreclosure is not pursued: 50% credit; 
 anti-blight 
Œ cash costs paid by servicer for property 
demolition 
Œ 100% credit; and 
 anti-blight 
Œ donation of real estate owned properties to 
qualifying recipients such as non-profit organizations: 
100% credit.  
  Additionally, the Consumer Re
lief Program limits the total 
amount of credits that may be ap
plied toward the $3.4 billion 
commitment from certain activities such as: 
 credits from deficiency balance 
waivers are limited to 10% of 
credits under the Consumer Relief Program; 
 credits for forgiveness of forbea
rance are limited to 12.5% of 
credits under the Consumer Relief Program; and 
 anti-blight provisions are limited to 12% of credits under the 
Consumer Relief Program. 
  We will begin to receive cred
it towards satisfaction of the 
requirements of the Consumer Relief Program for any activities 
taken on or after March 1, 2012. We can also receive an 
additional 25% credit for any first or second lien principal 
reduction taken within one year from March 1, 2012. Because we 

will not receive dollar-for-dollar credit for the relief provided in 
some circumstances, the actual 
relief we provide to borrowers 
will likely exceed our commitment. The terms also require that 
we satisfy 75% of the commitmen
ts under the Consumer Relief 
Program within two years from Marc
h 1, 2012. If we do not meet 
this two-year requirement and 
also do not meet the entire 
commitment within three years, we are required to pay an 
amount equal to 140% of the unmet commitment amount. If we 
meet the two-year commitment target, but do not meet the 

entire commitment amount within the three years, we are 
required to pay an amount eq
ual to 125% of the unmet 
commitment amount. We expect that we will be able to meet our 
commitment (and state-level sub-commitments) on the 
Consumer Relief Program within the required timeframes. 

 We expect to be able to meet our Consumer Relief Program 
commitment primarily through our first and second lien 
modification and short sale and other deficiency balance waiver 

programs. We have evaluated our commitment along with the 
menu of credits and believe that fulfilling our commitment 
under the Consumer Relief Pr
ogram has been appropriately 
considered in our estimation for 
the allowance for loan losses as 
well as our cash flow projection
s to evaluate the nonaccretable 
difference for our PCI portfolios at December 31, 2011. 
 Refinance Program 
The Refinance Program is intended for borrowers in good 
standing who are not experiencing
 financial difficulty, but are 
not able to take advantage of refinancing at lower rates to lower 
their payments because they have
 little or negative equity in 
their home. The terms of the pending settlement for the 

Refinance Program require that we provide notification to 

eligible borrowers indicating that they may refinance under the 
program. The minimum eligibility 
criteria for the program are as 
follows:  
 must be Wells Fargo owned first lien mortgage loan on 
property that is occupied; 
 loan must be current with no
 delinquencies in the last 

12 months; 
 must be fixed rate, adjustable rate, or interest-only 
mortgages with an initial period of five years or more; 
 current LTV is greater than 100%; 
 loans originated prior to January 1, 2009; 
 loans must have a current interest rate of at least 5.25% or 
100 basis points above the 
Freddie Mac current primary 
mortgage market survey rate, whichever is greater; 
 the minimum difference between the current interest rate 

and the offered interest rate under the Refinance Program 
must be at least 25 basis points
 or there must be at least a 
$100 reduction in monthly payment; and 
 the maximum unpaid principal 
balance must be below the 
GSE lending limit applicable to the respective state where the 

property is located. 
  Additionally, there are defined 
exclusions from the eligibility 
criteria such as FHA/VA loans, properties outside the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and loans for 
borrowers who have been in bank
ruptcy or foreclosure anytime 
in the prior 24 months. We are 
also permitted to extend the 
Refinance Program to borrowers beyond the minimum eligible 

population detailed above provid
ed they have an LTV over 80% 
and would not have qualified for a refinance under our other 
offered refinance programs in existence as of 
September 30, 2011. The structur
e of the refinanced loans can 
vary to include interest rate reduc
tions for the entire life of the 
loan or, depending on current interest rates, a minimum of 
75Risk Management 
Š Credit Risk Management 
(continued) 
 5 years. Additionally, the orig
inal term of the loan can be 
changed and the rate reduct
ion can be executed via a 
modification of the existing loan terms or a refinance into a new 
loan. The new loan or modified loan must be a fully amortizing 
product and the new interest rate will be capped at 100 basis 
points over the Freddie Mac cu
rrent primary mortgage market 
survey rate or 5.25%, whichever is
 greater, during the initial rate 
reduction period. 

 The credit we receive for each refinanced loan towards 
satisfying the $900 million financial commitment for the 

Refinance Program is calculated
 as the difference between the 
pre-existing interest rate and the new interest rate multiplied by 

the unpaid principal balance mult
iplied by a defined multiplier. 
The defined multiplier is 5 if the rate reduction only applies for 
5 years or if the remaining term 
is less than 10 years, 6 if the 
remaining term is between 10 
and 15 years, and 8 if the 
remaining term is greater than 15 
years. In addition, the terms of 
the settlement allow for additional dollars spent on the 
Refinance Program to be credited towards satisfying the 
requirements of the Consumer Re
lief Program (25% for the first 
lien principal reduction obligations and 75% for the second lien 
principal reduction obligations) subject to certain caps. We will 
receive credit under the Refinance Program for activities taken 
on or after March 1, 2012. The Refinance Program allows for an 

additional 25% credit (additional credit) for all refinance credits 
earned in the first 12 months of 
the program. We expect that we 
will be able to complete the numb
er of refinances necessary to 
satisfy the entire credit in the first 12 months of offering the 
Refinance Program. If successful
 in this regard, the estimated 
lifetime amount of interest inco
me reduction to the portfolio will 
be approximately $720 million an
d the additional credit earned 
will be $180 million. 
 We expect that we will refinance approximately 20,000 
borrowers with an unpaid principal balance of approximately 
$4.0 billion in order to meet 
the commitment amount under the 
Refinance Program. Based on the mix of loans we anticipate will 
be refinanced, we estimate their weighted average note rate will 
be reduced by approximately 260 
annual basis points and that 
their weighted average estimated remaining life will be 
approximately 7 years. These estimates will be impacted by the 
actual number of eligible borrowers that accept a refinance offer, 
their existing and new note rate
s and the remaining term of the 
actual loans refinanced. The impact of fulfilling our commitment 
under the Refinance Program will be
 recognized over a period of 
years in the form of lower intere
st income as qualified borrowers 
benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced under 
the Refinance Program. Based on 
our expectation that we will 
fulfill the credit needs for the Re
finance Program within the first 
12 months, we expect the future re
duction in interest income to 
be approximately $100 million annually. As a result of 
refinancings under the Refinanc
e Program we will be foregoing 
interest that we may not otherwise 
have agreed to forego. No loss 
was recognized in our financial statements for this estimated 
foregone interest income as the 
impact will be recognized over a 
period of years in the form of lo
wer interest income as qualified 
borrowers benefit from reduced interest rates on loans 
refinanced under the Refinanc
e Program. This impact to 
foregone interest income will be 
increased if we do not meet our 
expectation for fulfilling the total commitment for the Refinance 
Program in the first twelve months
. The impact of this foregone 
interest income on our future net interest margin is anticipated 
to be modestly adverse and will be influenced by the overall 
mortgage interest rate environment, which products are 
accepted by the eligible borrowers
, and the pace of
 the execution 
of the program. The Refinance Program will also impact our fair 
value for these loans. The estimated reduction to the fair value of 
our loans for the Refinance Program is approximately 
$700 million and will be impacted
 by our actual execution of the 
program and borrower acceptance rates. 
 Given that this component of the settlement relates to 
borrowers in good standing as 
to their payment history who are 
not experiencing financial diffic
ulty, we will evaluate each 
borrower to confirm their abil
ity to repay their mortgage 
obligation. This evaluation will include reviewing key credit and 

underwriting policy metrics to va
lidate that these borrowers are 
not experiencing financial difficul
ty and therefore, actions taken 
under the Refinance Program 
would not be considered a 
troubled debt restructuring. To 
the extent we determine that an 

eligible borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, we will 

consider alternative modification programs which may result in 
loans being classified and acco
unted for as troubled debt 
restructurings. 
 We expect that we will be able to meet the obligations of our 
commitment for the Refinance Program (and any state-level 
sub-commitments) and will not be required to pay for not 

meeting our commitment. 

 Comprehensive National
 Servicing Standards 
The settlement also establishes comprehensive national 

servicing standards that will govern loan default and foreclosure 
activities. These standards reflect a new set of best practices for 
mortgage servicing and not the identification of existing flaws or 
errors in current servicing practices.
 The national servicing 
standards include: 
 rules governing the preparation of documentation submitted 

in connection with judicial foreclosures, including 
foreclosure affidavits, declarations, and sworn statements; 
 rules governing the preparatio
n of evidence submitted to 
support non-judicial and quasi-judicial foreclosures; 
 requirements for ensuring 
the accuracy of borrower™s account 
information; 
 documentation of the foreclosing entity™s enforceable interest 

in the note, holder status
, and chain of assignment; 
 rules governing bankruptcy 
documentation and process 
including proofs of claim and motions for relief from stay; 
 rules governing the oversigh
t of third-party providers 
including foreclosure law firms, foreclosure trustees, 
subservicers, and other third parties retained to provide 
foreclosure, bankruptcy, or mortgage servicing activities; 
 requirements for loss mitigation programs, including: 
o notification to borrowers of loss mitigation options and 
enhanced communication of status of loss mitigation 
review; 
o restriction of ﬁdual trackﬂ progression of foreclosure 

during consideration for loan modification; 
o establishment of a borrower 
ﬁsingle point of contactﬂ;
 76  o development of electronic loan
 portals for status of first 
lien loan modifications; and 
o establishment of loan modification decision review 
process 
 enhanced protections for service members; 
 restrictions on certain default, foreclosure, and bankruptcy-
related service fees; and 
 restrictions on the imposition of force-placed insurance 
 
Monitoring and Othe
r Settlement Matters 
The settlement will be overseen by a third party monitor who 
will receive quarterly reports from servicers capturing progress 
towards implementing the servicing standards and satisfaction 

of the commitments of the Consumer Relief Program and the 
Refinance Program. These reports will be based on an agreed 
upon set of metrics and other information relevant to our 

compliance obligations. The enforcement provisions of the 
settlement include the parties™ right to seek penalties for non
-compliance, the monitor™s right to seek additional measurement 
metrics, and the right to enforc
e the Consent Order in federal 
court. 
 As part of the settlement, servicers will be released by the 
participating states and federal agencies from a number of 
servicing and origination claims. The releases given by the states 

and the federal agencies generally app
ly to ﬁcovered servicing 
conductﬂ and ﬁcovered originatio
n conduct.ﬂ The state release 
and the federal release extend to ﬁcovered servicing conductﬂ 

prior to the effective date of th
e settlement. The federal release 
for ﬁcovered origination conductﬂ depend
s on which agency and 
which law is involved. The Department of Justice and the 

Treasury are releasing claims under federal consumer credit laws 

governing loan origination. The FTC is releasing claims relating 
to origination conduct. HUD™s release of claims
 relating to 
origination conduct is limited to claims based exclusively on 
false annual certifications of co
mpliance that are submitted to 
HUD, and retains the right to pursue individual loan-level 
violations of the Federal Housing Administration origination 

rules and regulations. The Department of Justice™s release from 
claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 

Enforcement Act (claims involving harm to financial institutions 
or federal agencies based on intentional fraud or 
misrepresentation by a bank or its affiliates) is also limited. 

  A number of subject areas are carved out from the releases:  
criminal law violations, claims by natural persons, unpaid taxes, 
fair lending claims (the state release applies this exception only 
to loan origination conduct, while the federal release extends the 
exception to origination and servicing conduct), securitization 
claims (includes claims that the 
government could bring as an 
investor in mortgage-related se
curities and for the benefit of 
investors or for conduct directed at investors), claims against 

MERS or MERSCORP, Inc., although we are released from 
claims relating to our use of MERS (but still retain an obligation 

as a MERS shareholder to inde
mnify MERS against third-party 
claims), claims of county recorders, and certain existing 

litigation and other obligations. Under the sub-commitment 

agreement with California, there 
is a limited expansion of its 
ability to pursue certain origination claims involving individual 

claims for actual fraud against consumers for origination 

conduct occurring on or after July 1, 2009
. There are also side 
agreements with New York, Delaware and Massachusetts 

whereby these states retain the 
right to pursue their existing 
MERS litigation, subject to certain limitations. 

 Other aspects of the federal release include a carve out under 

federal consumer credit laws for violations of RESPA related to 
private mortgage insurance and th
e retention of all rights by 
FHFA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
 Ginnie Mae, the Federal Home 
Loan Bank, the SEC, the CFPB (a
fter July 21, 2011) and the 
federal banking agencies. 
 Additional information on risks and litigation relating to 

servicing activities is included in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to 

Financial Statements in this Report. 
  77   Asset/Liability Management  
Asset/liability management involves the evaluation, 
monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, 
liquidity and funding. The Corporate Asset/Liability 
Management Committee (Corpora
te ALCO), which oversees 
these risks and reports periodic
ally to the Finance Committee 
of the Board, consists of senior financial and business 
executives. Each of our principal business groups has its own 
asset/liability management committee and process linked to 
the Corporate ALCO process. 

 INTEREST RATE RISK
 Interest rate risk, which potentially can 
have a significant earnings impact, 
is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because:  
 assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities 
and interest rates are generally falling, earnings will 
initially decline);  
 assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 

different amounts (for example, when the general level of 

interest rates is falling, we may reduce rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that 
is less than the general decline in market interest rates);  
 short-term and long-term market interest rates may 
change by different amounts (f
or example, the shape of the 
yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); or  
 the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest
 rates change (for example, 
if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, MBS 
held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio may 
prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could 
reduce portfolio income).  
 Interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on 
loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, the 
fair value of MSRs and other financial instruments, the value of 
the pension liability and other items affecting earnings. 

 We assess interest rate risk 
by comparing our most likely 
earnings plan with various earnings simulations using many 

interest rate scenarios that diff
er in the direction of interest 
rate changes, the degree of ch
ange over time, the speed of 
change and the projected shape of
 the yield curve. For example, 
as of December 31, 2011, our most recent simulation indicated 

estimated earnings at risk of less than 1% of our most likely 
earnings plan over the next 12
 months under a range of both 
lower and higher interest rates,
 including a scenario in which 
the federal funds rate remains
 unchanged and the 10-year 
Constant Maturity Treasury bond yield averages below 2.00%, 
and a scenario in which the fede
ral funds rate rises to 3.75% 
and the 10-year Constant Maturity Treasury bond yield 
increases to 5.10%. Simulation estimates depend on, and will 
change with, the size and mi
x of our actual and projected 
balance sheet at the time of each simulation. Due to timing 
differences between the quarterly valuation of MSRs and the 
eventual impact of interest rates on mortgage banking 

volumes, earnings at risk in any particular quarter could be 
higher than the average earnings at risk over the 12-month 
simulation period, depending on the path of interest rates and 
on our hedging strategies for MSRs. See the ﬁRisk Management 
Œ Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Riskﬂ section in 
this Report for more information. 
 We use exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) 
interest rate derivatives to hedg
e our interest rate exposures. 
The notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and 
estimated net fair value of these derivatives as of 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, are presented in Note 16 

(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use 
derivatives for asset/liability management in three main ways:  
 to convert a major portion of our long-term fixed-rate 
debt, which we issue to finance the Company, from fixed-
rate payments to floating-rat
e payments by entering into 
receive-fixed swaps;  
 to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or 
liability instruments/portfolios from fixed-rate payments 
to floating-rate payments
 or vice versa; and  
 to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 

funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate 

swaps, swaptions, futures, forwards and options.  
 MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK
 We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects 
us to various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate 
risks. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce 

credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing some or all of 

the long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans we originate and most 
of the ARMs we originate. On
 the other hand, we may hold 
originated ARMs and fixed-rate
 mortgage loans in our loan 
portfolio as an investment for our growing base of core 
deposits. We determine whether 
the loans will be held for 
investment or held for sale at 
the time of commitment. We may 
subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment 
and sell some or all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as 

part of our corporate asset/liability management. We may also 
acquire and add to our securities available for sale a portion of 
the securities issued at the time we securitize MHFS.
  Notwithstanding the continued downturn in the housing 
sector, and the continued la
ck of liquidity in the 
nonconforming secondary markets, our mortgage banking 
revenue remained strong, reflecting the complementary 

origination and servicing strengths of the business. The 

secondary market for agency-conforming mortgages 

functioned well during 2011.
  Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in the 

mortgage business. Changes in interest rates may potentially 

reduce total origination and servicing fees, the value of our 
residential MSRs measured at fair value, the value of MHFS 
and the associated income and loss reflected in mortgage 

banking noninterest income
, the income and expense 
associated with instruments (economic hedges) used to hedge 
changes in the fair value of MSRs and MHFS, and the value of 
derivative loan commitments (interest rate ﬁlocksﬂ) extend
ed to mortgage applicants. 

 Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination 

and servicing fees because consumer demand for new 
78  mortgages and the level of refinancing activity are sensitive to 
changes in mortgage interest ra
tes. Typically, a decline in 
mortgage interest rates will lead
 to an increase in mortgage 
originations and fees and may also lead to an increase in 
servicing fee income, depending on the level of new loans 
added to the servicing portfoli
o and prepayments. Given the 
time it takes for consumer behavior to fully react to interest 
rate changes, as well as the ti
me required for processing a new 
application, providing the comm
itment, and securitizing and 
selling the loan, interest rate changes will affect origination and 

servicing fees with a lag. The 
amount and timing of the impact 
on origination and servicing fees will depend on the 

magnitude, speed and duration of th
e change in interest rates. 
 We measure MHFS at fair value for prime MHFS 
originations for which an active secondary market and readily 
available market prices exist to reliably support fair value 

pricing models used for these loans. Loan origination fees on 
these loans are recorded when earned, and related direct loan 
origination costs are recognized when incurred. We also 
measure at fair value certain of our other interests held related 
to residential loan sales and securitizations. We believe fair 

value measurement for prime MHFS and other interests held, 
which we hedge with free-standing derivatives (economic 
hedges) along with our MSRs measured at fair value, reduces 

certain timing differences and 
better matches changes in the 
value of these assets with chan
ges in the value of derivatives 
used as economic hedges for these assets. During 2011 and 

2010, in response to continued 
secondary market illiquidity, we 
continued to originate certain prime non-agency loans to be 
held for investment for the foreseeable future rather than to be 
held for sale. In addition, in 2011 and 2010, we originated 

certain prime agency-eligible loans to be held for investment as 
part of our asset/liability management strategy. 
  We initially measure all of our MSRs at fair value and carry 
substantially all of them at fair value depending on our strategy 
for managing interest rate risk
. Under this method, the MSRs 
are recorded at fair value at the 
time we sell or securitize the 
related mortgage loans. The carrying value of MSRs carried at 

fair value reflects changes in 
fair value at the end of each 
quarter and changes are included
 in net servicing income, a 
component of mortgage banking noninterest income. If the fair 

value of the MSRs increases, inco
me is recognized; if the fair 
value of the MSRs decreases, a loss is recognized. We use a 
dynamic and sophisticated model to
 estimate the fair value of 
our MSRs and periodically benchmark our estimates to 
independent appraisals. The valuation of MSRs can be highly 
subjective and involve complex judgments by management 
about matters that are inherently
 unpredictable. See ﬁCritical 
Accounting Policies 
Œ Valuation of Residential Mortgage 
Servicing Rightsﬂ section of 
this Report for additional 
information. Changes in interest
 rates influence a variety of 

significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of 
MSRs, including prepayment sp
eeds, expected returns and 
potential risks on the servicing 
asset portfolio, the value of 
escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. 

 A decline in interest rates generally increases the propensity 
for refinancing, reduces the expe
cted duration of the servicing 
portfolio and therefore reduces 
the estimated fair value of 
MSRs. This reduction in fair va
lue causes a charge to income 
for MSRs carried at fair value, net of any gains on free-standing 

derivatives (economic hedges) 
used to hedge MSRs. We may 
choose not to fully hedge all the po
tential decline in the value of 
our MSRs resulting from a declin
e in interest rates because the 
potential increase in origination/
servicing fees in that scenario 
provides a partial ﬁnatural business hedge.ﬂ An increase in 

interest rates generally reduces the propensity for refinancing, 
extends the expected duration 
of the servicing portfolio and 
therefore increases the estima
ted fair value of the MSRs. 
However, an increase in interest rates can also reduce 

mortgage loan demand and therefore reduce origination 
income. 

 The price risk associated with our MSRs is economically 
hedged with a combination of highly liquid interest rate 
forward instruments including mortgage forward contracts, 

interest rate swaps and intere
st rate options. All of the 
instruments included in the he
dge are marked to market daily. 
Because the hedging instruments are traded in highly liquid 
markets, their prices are read
ily observable and are fully 
reflected in each quarter™s mark to market. Quarterly MSR 
hedging results include a combination of directional gain or 
loss due to market changes as well as any carry income 

generated. If the economic hedge is effective, its overall 

directional hedge gain or loss 
will offset the change in the 
valuation of the underlying MSR asset. Gains or losses 

associated with these econom
ic hedges are included in 
mortgage banking noninterest income. Consistent with our 

longstanding approach to hedgin
g interest rate risk in the 
mortgage business, the size of
 the hedge and the particular 
combination of hedging instruments at any point in time is 

designed to reduce the volatili
ty of the mortgage business™s 
earnings over various time frames within a range of mortgage 

interest rates. Because market fa
ctors, the composition of the 
mortgage servicing portfolio an
d the relationship between the 
origination and servicing sides of our mortgage business 

change continually, the types 
of instruments used in our 
hedging are reviewed daily and rebalanced based on our 

evaluation of current market factors and the interest rate risk 

inherent in our MSRs portfolio. Throughout 2011, our 
economic hedging strategy gene
rally used forward mortgage 
purchase contracts that were effe
ctive at offsetting the impact 
of interest rates on the value of the MSR asset. 
  Mortgage forward contracts ar
e designed to pass the full 
economics of the underlying reference mortgage securities to 

the holder of the contract, incl
uding both the directional gain 
or loss from the forward delivery of the reference securities and 

the corresponding carry income. 
Carry income represents the 
contract™s price accretion from th
e forward delivery price to the 
current spot price including bo
th the yield earned on the 
reference securities and the market implied cost of financing 

during the period. The actual amo
unt of carry income earned 
on the hedge each quarter will
 depend on the amount of the 
underlying asset that is hedged
 and the particular instruments 
included in the hedge. The level of carry income is driven by 
the slope of the yield curve and 
other market driven supply and 
demand factors affecting the spec
ific reference securities. A 
steep yield curve generally produc
es higher carry income while 
79Risk Management 
Œ Asset/Liability Management 
(continued) 
 a flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially 
negative carry income. The level of
 carry income is also affected 
by the type of instrument used. In general, mortgage forward 
contracts tend to produce higher carry income than interest 
rate swap contracts. Carry income 
is recognized over the life of 
the mortgage forward as a componen
t of the contract™s mark to 
market gain or loss.  

 Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in 
mortgage banking is a complex process that requires 
sophisticated modeling and co
nstant monitoring. While we 
attempt to balance these various aspects of the mortgage 
business, there are several po
tential risks to earnings: 
 Valuation changes for MSRs associated with interest rate 
changes are recorded in earn
ings immediately within the 
accounting period in which those interest rate changes 

occur, whereas the impact 
of those same changes in 
interest rates on origination and servicing fees occur with 
a lag and over time. Thus, the mortgage business could be 
protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a 
period of time on a cumulative basis but still display large 
variations in income from on
e accounting period to the 
next. 
 The degree to which the ﬁnatural business hedgeﬂ offsets 

valuation changes for MSRs is imperfect, varies at 

different points in the interest rate cycle, and depends not 
just on the direction of intere
st rates but on the pattern of 
quarterly interest rate changes. 
 Origination volumes, the valuation of MSRs and hedging 
results and associated costs are also affected by many 
factors. Such factors include the mix of new business 
between ARMs and fixed-rate mortgages, the relationship 

between short-term and long-term interest rates, the 
degree of volatility in interest rates, the relationship 
between mortgage interest rates and other interest rate 
markets, and other interest rate factors. Many of these 
factors are hard to predict 
and we may not be able to 
directly or perfectly hedge their effect.  
 While our hedging activities 
are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest 
rate risks, the financial 

instruments we use may not pe
rfectly correlate with the 
values and income being hedg
ed. For example, the change 
in the value of ARM production
 held for sale from changes 
in mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by 
Treasury and LIBOR index-based financial instruments 

used as economic hedges fo
r such ARMs. Additionally, 
hedge-carry income on our ec
onomic hedges for the MSRs 
may not continue if the spread between short-term and 
long-term rates decreases, we shift composition of the 

hedge to more interest rate swaps, or there are other 
changes in the market for mort
gage forwards that affect 
the implied carry.   The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 
MSRs was $14.0 billion and $15.9 billion at December 31, 2011 
and 2010, respectively. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 5.14% and 5.39% at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our total MSRs 

represented 0.76% of mortgage loans serviced for others at 
December 31, 2011, compared with 0.86% at 
December 31, 2010. 

 As part of our mortgage bank
ing activities, we enter into 
commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specified 
times in the future. A mortgage loan commitment is an interest 
rate lock that binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at 
a specified interest rate and within a specified period of time, 

generally up to 60 days after in
ception of the rate lock. These 
loan commitments are derivative loan commitments if the 

loans that will result from the 
exercise of the commitments will 
be held for sale. These derivative loan commitments are 
recognized at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in 
their fair values recorded as part of mortgage banking 

noninterest income. The fair value of these commitments 
include, at inception and du
ring the life of the loan 
commitment, the expected net future cash flows related to the 

associated servicing of the loa
n as part of the fair value 
measurement of derivative loan commitments. Changes 

subsequent to inception are base
d on changes in fair value of 
the underlying loan resulting from the exercise of the 

commitment and changes in the pr
obability that the loan will 
not fund within the terms of th
e commitment, referred to as a 
fall-out factor. The value of the underlying loan commitment is 

affected primarily by changes in
 interest rates and the passage 
of time. 
 Outstanding derivative loan co
mmitments expose us to the 
risk that the price of the mo
rtgage loans underlying the 
commitments might decline due 
to increases in mortgage 
interest rates from inception of 
the rate lock to the funding of 
the loan. To minimize this ri
sk, we employ forwards and 
options, Eurodollar futures and options, and Treasury futures, 
forwards and options contracts as economic hedges against the 
potential decreases in the values
 of the loans. We expect that 
these derivative financial inst
ruments will experience changes 
in fair value that will either fu
lly or partially o
ffset the changes 
in fair value of the derivative loan commitments. However, 
changes in investor demand, such as concerns about credit 
risk, can also cause changes in the spread relationships 
between underlying loan value 
and the derivative financial 
instruments that cannot be hedged. 
 MARKET RISK 
Œ TRADING ACTIVITIES
 From a market risk 
perspective, our net income is exposed to changes in interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 

commodity prices and their implied volatilities. The primary 
purpose of our trading businesses is to accommodate 
customers in the management of 
their market price risks. Also, 
we take positions based on mark
et expectations or to benefit 
from price differences between financial instruments and 
markets, subject to risk limits established and monitored by 
Corporate ALCO. All securities, 
foreign exchange transactions, 
commodity transactions and derivatives used in our trading 
businesses are carried at fa
ir value. The Market and 
Institutional Risk Committee, wh
ich provides governance and 
oversight over market risk-taking activities across the 

Company, establishes and monito
rs counterparty risk limits. 
The credit risk amount and estimated net fair value of all 

customer accommodation derivatives at December 31, 2011 
80  and 2010 are included in Note 
16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. Op

               The amounts reflected in the

(losses) due to changes in fair value of our trading positions 
and are reported within net gains 
(losses) on trading activities 
within noninterest income line item of the income statement. 

These amounts do not include interest income and other fees 

earned from related activities, which are reported within 
interest income from trading assets and other fees within 
noninterest income line items of the income statement. 

Categorization of net gains (losses) from trading activities in 
the table above is based on 
our own definition of those 
categories, as further described below, because no uniform 
industry definitions currently exist. 
 Customer accommodation trading consists of security or 
derivative transactions conducted in an effort to help 

customers manage their market pr
ice risks and are done on 
their behalf or driven by their investment needs. For the 
majority of our customer accommodation trading we serve as 
intermediary between buyer and seller. For example, we may 
enter into financial instrument
s with customers that use the 
instruments for risk management purposes and offset our 

exposure on such contracts by entering into separate 
instruments. Customer accommodation trading also includes 

net gains related to market-making activities in which we take 
positions to facilitate expe
cted customer order flow.  
 Economic hedges consist primarily of cash or derivative 

positions used to facilitate ce
rtain of our balance sheet risk 
management activities that did not qualify for hedge 
accounting or were not design
ated in a hedge accounting 
relationship. Economic hedges may also include securities that 
we elected to carry at fair va
lue with changes in fair value 
recorded to earnings in order to mitigate accounting 

measurement mismatches or avoid embedded derivative 
accounting complexities.   
 Proprietary trading consists 
of security or derivative 
positions executed for our own account based on market 
expectations or to benefit from price differences between 
financial instruments and markets. Proprietary trading activity 
is expected to be restricted by
 the Dodd-Frank Act prohibitions 
known as the ﬁVolcker Rule,ﬂ which has not yet been finalized. 
On October 11, 2011, federal 
banking agencies and the SEC 
issued for public comment proposed regulations to implement 

the Volcker Rule. We believe our definition of proprietary 
trading is consistent with the 
proposed regulations. However, 
given that final rule-makin
g is required by various 
governmental regulatory agencies to define proprietary trading 

within the context of the final ﬁVolc
ker Rule,ﬂ our definition of 
proprietary trading may change. 
We have reduced or exited 
certain business activities in anticipation of the final ﬁVolcker 

Rule.ﬂ As discussed within the noninterest income section of 
our financial results, propriet
ary trading activity is not 
significant to our financial results. 
  The fair value of our trading derivatives is reported in 
Notes 16 (Derivatives) and 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 

Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. The fair 
value of our trading securities is reported in Note 17 (Fair 
Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this 

Report. 
 The standardized approach for monitoring and reporting 
market risk for the trad
ing activities consists of value-at-risk 
(VaR) metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and 
stress testing. VaR measures the worst expected loss over a 
given time interval and within a given confidence interval. We 
measure and report daily VaR at
 a 99% confidence interval 
based on actual changes in rates and prices over the previous 
250 trading days. The analys
is captures all financial 
instruments that are considered 
trading positions. The average 
one-day VaR throughout 2011 was $29 million, with a lower 

bound of $19 million and an upper bound of $42 million. The 
average one-day VaR for fourth quarter 2011 was $32 million, 
with a lower bound of $22 million and an upper bound of 

$42 million.  
 MARKET RISK 
Œ EQUITY MARKETS
 We are directly and 
indirectly affected by change
s in the equity markets. We make 
and manage direct equity investments in start-up businesses, 
emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, 
acquisitions and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in 
non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity 
investments. These private equity investments are made within 
capital allocations approved 
by management and the Board. 
The Board™s policy is to review business developments, key 

risks and historical returns fo
r the private equity investment 
portfolio at least annually. Management reviews the valuations 
of these investments at least 
quarterly and assesses them for 
possible OTTI. For nonmarketable investments, the analysis is 
based on facts and circumstances of each individual investment 

and the expectations for that 
investment™s cash flows and 
capital needs, the viability of its business model and our exit 

strategy. Nonmarketable investments include private equity 
investments accounted for under the cost method and equity 
method. Private equity invest
ments are subject to OTTI. 
Principal investments are carr
ied at fair value with net 
unrealized gains and losses reported in noninterest income.  

 As part of our business to 
support our customers, we trade 
public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have risk mandates that govern these activities. We 
also have marketable equity securities in the securities 
available-for-sale portfolio, incl
uding securities relating to our 
venture capital activities. We 
manage these investments within 
capital risk limits approved by management and the Board and 
monitored by Corporate ALCO. Gains and losses on these

(continued) 
 securities are recognized in 
net income when realized and 
periodically include OTTI charges. 
Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 
our net income by affecting (1) the value of third party assets 
under management and, hence, 
fee income, (2) particular 
borrowers, whose ability to repay 
principal and/or interest may 

be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, 

related commission income and other business activities. Each 
business line monitors and ma
nages these indirect risks.

                  LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING
 The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 

cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under unpredicta
ble circumstances of industry 
or market stress. To achieve this
 objective, the Corporate ALCO 
establishes and monitors liquidity guidelines that require 

sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding 
requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less 

reliable funding markets. We set 
these guidelines for both the 
consolidated balance sheet and fo
r the Parent to ensure that 
the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-
taking banking subsidiaries. 

 Unencumbered debt and equity securities in the securities 
available-for-sale portfolio provide asset liquidity, in addition 
to the immediately liquid resour
ces of cash and due from banks 
and federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale 
agreements and other short-term investments. The weighted-
average expected remaining matu
rity of the debt securities 
within this portfolio was 4.9 year
s at December 31, 2011. Of the 
$212.6 billion (cost basis) of debt securities in this portfolio at 
December 31, 2011, $38.5 billion (18%) is expected to mature 
or be prepaid in 2012 and an a
dditional $34.8 billion (16%) in 
2013.
 Asset liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to sell or 
securitize loans in secondary markets and to pledge loans to 
access secured borrowing facilities through the Federal Home 
Loan Banks (FHLB) and the FR
B. In 2011, we sold or 
securitized mortgage loans of $353 billion. The amount of 
mortgage loans and other consumer loans available to be sold, 
securitized or pledged was approximately $222 billion at 

December 31, 2011. 
 Core customer deposits have historically provided a sizeable 
source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. At December 

31, 2011, core deposits funded 113% of total loans compared 
with 105% a year ago. Additional funding is provided by long-
term debt (including trust preferred securities), other foreign 

deposits, and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt averaged 
$141.1 billion in 2011 and $185.4 billion in 2010. Short-term 
borrowings averaged $51.8 billion in 2011 and $46.8 billion in 

2010.  We anticipate making capital expenditures of 
approximately $930 million in 20
12 for our stores, relocation 
and remodeling of our facilities, and routine replacement of 

furniture, equipment and servers. We fund expenditures from 

various sources, including funds from operations and 
borrowings. 
 In mid-2009, we froze the Wells Fargo & Company Cash 

Balance Plan. As a result, pension funding is not a material 
consideration in our liquidity management. See Note 20 
(Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) to Financial 

Statements in this Report fo
r additional information on 
pension and postretirement plans. 
 We access domestic and international capital markets for 
long-term funding through issuances of registered debt 

securities, private placements and asset-backed secured 
funding. Investors in the long
-term capital markets generally 
will consider, among other factors
, a company™s debt rating in 
making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their 
ratings on many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, including 
capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level 
and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions 
regarding the probability and extent of Federal financial 

assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. 
Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of 
our credit rating; however, a reduction in credit rating would 

not cause us to violate any of our debt covenants. 

 In September 2011, Moody™s Investors Service, Inc. 
(Moody™s) downgraded the long
-term senior debt ratings of the 
Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the Parent™s significant 
banking subsidiary, one notch to A2 and Aa3, respectively, 
based on its determination that, as a result of the Dodd-Frank 

Act, the U.S. government is less
 likely to support systemically 
important financial institutions,
 if needed, in the future. 
Moody™s outlook on the Parent™s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.™s 

long-term senior debt ratings is negative based on the 
possibility that Moody™s may 
further reduce its assumptions 
about the likelihood of government support for systemically 
important financial institutions. In November 2011, S&P 
lowered the long-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. one notch to A+ and AA-, respectively, 

following changes in S&P™s ratings criteria for the global 
82  banking industry. S&P also 
reduced the Parent™s short
-term debt ratings one notch to A-1, affirmed Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A.™s short
-term debt rating at A-1+ and maintained a 
negative outlook on the Parent™s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.™s 
long-term debt, reflecting the outlook on the U.S. sovereign 
rating in light of the amount 
of U.S. government support 
incorporated into our ratings. In July 2011, Fitch Ratings 
affirmed both the Parent™s and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.™s long
-term senior and short-term debt ratings and maintained a 

stable watch on those ratings. In March 2011, Dominion Bond 

Rating Service (DBRS) confirmed 
both the Parent™s and Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A.™s long
-term senior and short-term debt 
ratings, including the stable trend. The Moody™s and S&P™s 
ratings downgrades have not adversely affected our ability to 
access the capital markets and we
 do not believe there has been 
any meaningful change in our borrowing costs specifically 
relating to the ratings downgr
ades. See the ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ 
section of this Report for additional information regarding our 
credit ratings and the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on 
our liquidity and operations, as we

Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for 
certain derivative instruments in
 the event our credit ratings 
were to fall below investment grade.

as of December 31, 2011,

                     On December 20, 2011, the FRB 
proposed enhanced liquidity 
planning rules that would be ap
plicable to us. The proposed 
rules, among other things, require periodic stress testing, the 

preparation of contingent fundin
g plans, and the establishment 
of corporate governance procedures for managing liquidity risk. 

These rules, however, are not yet final. We will continue to 
analyze the proposed rules and other regulatory proposals that 
may impact liquidity management, including Basel III, to 
determine the level of operational or compliance impact to Wells 

Fargo.

and ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ sections in this Report.
  Parent Under SEC rules, the Parent is classified as a ﬁwell
-known 
seasoned issuer,ﬂ which allows it to file a registration 
statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. In 

June 2009, the Parent filed a re
gistration statement with the 
SEC for the issuance of senior an
d subordinated notes, preferred 
stock and 
other securities. The Parent™s ability to issue debt and 
other securities under this registration statement is limited by 
the debt issuance authority grante
d by the Board. The Parent is 
currently authorized by the Board to issue $60 billion in 
outstanding short-term debt an
d $170 billion in outstanding 
long-term debt. During 2011, the Parent issued $9.3 billion in 
registered senior notes. In February 2011, the Parent remarketed 

$2.5 billion of junior subordinated notes owned by an 
unconsolidated, wholly owned trust. The purchasers of the 
junior subordinated notes exchan
ged them with the Parent for 
newly issued senior notes, which are included in the Parent 
issuances described above. Proceeds of the remarketed junior 
subordinated notes were used by the trust to purchase 

$2.5 billion of Class A, Series I Preferred Stock issued by the 
Parent. In February 2012, the Parent issued $3.3 billion in 
registered senior notes. 
 Parent™s proceeds from securities issued in 2011 and in first 
quarter 2012 were used for ge
neral corporate purposes, and, 
unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus or 

prospectus supplement, we expect the proceeds from securities 
issued in the future will be 
used for the same purposes. 
Depending on market conditions, we may purchase our 
outstanding debt securities from
 time to time in privately 
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or 
otherwise. 

 Table 43 
provides information regarding the Parent™s 
medium-term note (MTN) programs. The Parent may issue 

senior and subordinated debt securities under Series I & J, and 

the European and Australian pr
ogrammes. Under Series K, the 
Parent may issue senior debt securities linked to one or more 

indices or bearing interest at
 a fixed or floating rate.

to CAD$7.0 billion in medium-term notes. During 2011, WFCC 
issued CAD$500 million in medi

CAD$1.5 billion in medium-term notes. All medium-term notes 
issued by WFCC are unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent. 
 FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP
 We are a member 
of the Federal Home Loan Banks based in Dallas, Des Moines 
and San Francisco (collectively, the FHLBs). Each member of 
each of the FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum 
investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB. The board of 
directors of each FHLB can in
crease the minimum investment 
requirements in the event it has concluded that additional 
capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital 
requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment 

requirements outside of specified 
ranges requires the approval of 
the Federal Housing Finance Board. Because the extent of any 

obligation to increase our investment in any of the FHLBs 

depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential 
future payments to the FH
LBs are not determinable. 
  Capital Management 
 We have an active program for managing stockholders™ equity 
and regulatory capital and maintain a comprehensive process for 

assessing the Company™s overall 
capital adequacy. We generate 
capital primarily through the re
tention of earnings net of 
dividends. Our objective is to
 maintain capital at an amount 
commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both re
gulatory and market expectations. 
Our potential sources of stockholders™ equity include retained 
earnings and issuances of common and preferred stock. 
Retained earnings increased $12.5 billion from 

December 31, 2010, predominantly from Wells Fargo net income 
of $15.9 billion, less common and preferred stock dividends of 
$3.4 billion. During 2011, we issued approximately 86 million 
shares of common stock, substantially all of which related to 
employee benefit plans. We also repurchased approximately 
86 million shares of common stock at a net cost of $2.4 billion 
during 2011. 

 Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our subsidiary banks are subject to 

various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered 
by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-bas
ed capital (RBC) guidelines 
establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different 
categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At 
December 31, 2011, the Company and each of our subsidiary 
banks were ﬁwell
-capitalizedﬂ under applicable regulatory capital 
adequacy guidelines. See Note
 26 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information. 
 Current regulatory RBC rules are based primarily on broad 
credit-risk considerations and limited market-related risks, but 

do not take into account other types of risk facing a financial 
services company. Our capital 
adequacy assessment process 
contemplates a wide range of ri
sks that the Company is exposed 
to and also takes into consid
eration our performance under a 
variety of stressed economic conditions, as well as regulatory 
expectations and guidance, rating agency viewpoints and the 
view of capital markets participants. 

 In 2007, U.S. bank regulators approved a final rule adopting 
international guidelines for determining regulatory capital 
known as ﬁBasel II.ﬂ Basel II in
corporates three pillars that 
address (a) capital adequacy, (b) supervisory review, which 
relates to the computation of ca
pital and internal assessment 
processes, and (c) market discipline, through increased 
disclosure requirements. We are 
well underway toward Basel II 
implementation and currently anti
cipate entering the ﬁparallel 
run phaseﬂ of Basel II in 2012. During the ﬁparallel run phase,ﬂ 
banks must successfully complete at least a four quarter 

evaluation period under supervision from regulatory agencies in 
order to be compliant with the Basel II final rule
. Our delayed 
entry into the ﬁparallel run 
phaseﬂ was approved by t
he FRB in 
2010 as a result of our acquisition of Wachovia. 

 In December 2010, the 
Basel Committee on Bank 
Supervision (BCBS) finalized a set of international guidelines for 
determining regulatory capital 
known as ﬁBasel III.ﬂ These 
guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 

2008 and 2009 and address many 
of the weaknesses identified 
in the banking sector as contri
buting to the crisis including 
excessive leverage, inadequate and low quality capital and 

insufficient liquidity buffers. The guidelines, among other 

things, increase minimum capital requirements and when fully 
phased in require bank holding companies to maintain a 
minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 

of at least 7.0%. The U.S. regu
latory bodies are reviewing the 
final international standards and final U.S. rulemaking is 

expected to be completed in 2012. 

 The BCBS also proposed additional Tier 1 common equity 
surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks 
(G-SIBs). The surcharge ranges from 1.0% to 3.5% depending on 
the bank™s systemic importance
 to be determ
ined under an 
indicator-based approach that would consider five broad 
categories: cross-jurisdictional activity, size, inter-
connectedness, substitutabili
ty/financial institution 
infrastructure and complexity. These additional capital 
requirements, which would be phased in beginning in 
January 2016 and become fully 
effective on January 1, 2019, 
would be in addition to the Basel III 7.0% Tier 1 common equity 
requirement finalized in December 2010. The Financial Stability 

Board has determined that the 
Company is one of the initial 
84  29 G-SIBs that would be subject 
to the surcharge, but has not yet 
determined the surcharge amount for us and the other banks. 
 The FRB also recently proposed rules required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act that will impose enhanced prudential standards 
on large bank holding companies (BHCs) such as Wells Fargo, 
including enhanced capital, stress testing and liquidity 
requirements. We are reviewing th
e proposed rules to determine 
their potential effect on our business. 
 Although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules, 
including the FRB™s approach to capital requirements, we 

evaluate the impact of Basel III 
on our capital ratios based on 
our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements and we 

estimate that our Tier 1 common
 equity ratio under the Basel III 
proposal exceeded the fully phased-in minimum of 7.0% by 
50 basis points at the end of 20
11. This estimate is subject to 
change depending on final promulgation of Basel III capital 
rulemaking and interpretations thereof by regulatory 
authorities. 
 Table 44 and Table 45, which 
appear at the end of this 
Capital Management section, provide information regarding our 

Tier 1 common equity calculation under Basel I and as estimated 

under Basel III, respectively.
  
Capital Planning  

In connection with its increased focus on the adequacy of 
regulatory capital and risk management for large financial firms, 
the FRB required large banks to submit a capital plan in early 

2011 as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

(CCAR). Following submission of our capital plan on 
January 7, 2011, the FRB notified 
us on March 18, 2011, that it 
did not object to our 2011 capital plan. Since that notification, 
the Company took several capital actions, including increasing 
the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.12 a share, 
repurchasing $2.4 billion of our common stock, and redeeming 
$9.2 billion of trust preferred securities that will no longer count 
as Tier 1 capital under the Do
dd-Frank Act and the proposed 
Basel III capital standards. 
 In late 2011, the FRB finalized rules to require large BHCs to 
submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval 

before making capital distributions. The rule requires updates to 
capital plans in the event of material changes in a BHC™s risk 
profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions. 

 Under the FRB™s new capital plan rule, t
he 2012 CCAR will 
include a comprehensive capital plan supported by an 
assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given 
planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, 
similar to the process the FRB re
lied upon to conduct the 2011 
CCAR. As part of the 2012 CCAR
, the FRB will also generate a 
supervisory stress test driven by a sharp decline in the economy 
and significant decline in asse
t pricing using the information 
provided by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB has 
indicated it will publish its estimates of performance under this 
scenario on a BHC-specific basis. We submitted our board-
approved 2012 capital plan to the FRB on January 6, 2012. We 
expect the FRB™s response to our submission in March 2012. 
   Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Boar
d authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share 
repurchases, we typically do 
not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. 
Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market 
repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or 

delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may
 enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of
 Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Variou
s factors determine the amount 
and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital 
requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for 

employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions 
(including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and 
legal considerations, including th
e FRB™s response to our capital 
plan. 
 In 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 
25 million additional shares of our outstanding common stock. 
In first quarter 2011, the Board a
uthorized the repurchase of an 
additional 200 million shares. During 2011, we repurchased 
80 million shares of our common stock in the open market and 
from our employee benefit plans and an additional 6 million 
shares through a private forwar
d repurchase transaction that 
settled in fourth quarter 2011. During fourth quarter 2011, we 
entered into a second forward repurchase transaction that 
settled in first quarter 2012 for approximately 6 million shares of 

common stock. At December 31
, 2011, we had utilized all 
previously remaining common stock repurchase authority from 
the 2008 authorization and had remaining authority from the 
2011 authorization to purchase approximately 117 million 

shares. For more information about share repurchases during 
2011, see Part II, Item 5 of
 our 2011 Form 10-K and for 
additional information about our forward repurchase programs 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

 Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 
the ﬁsafe harborﬂ conditio
ns of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a 
limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 

limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or 

all of the consideration. Our 
management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available,
 it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of 
this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other cond
itions of the safe harbor, 
including the standing daily vo
lume limitation that applies 
whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

 In connection with our partic
ipation in the Troubled Asset 
Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), we 
issued to the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to purchase 
110,261,688 shares of our common stock with an exercise price 
of $34.01 per share expiring on October 28, 2018. The Board 
authorized the repurchase by the 
Company of up to $1 billion of 
the warrants. On May 26, 2010, in an auction by the U.S. 
Treasury, we purchased 70,165,963 of the warrants at a price of 
85Capital Management 
(continued) 
 $7.70 per warrant. We have purchased an additional 
916,216 warrants since the U.S. Treasury auction. At 

December 31, 2011, there were 39
,179,509 warrants outstanding 
and exercisable and $453 million of unused warrant repurchase 
authority. Depending on market conditions, we may purchase 
from time to time additional warr
ants in privately negotiated or 
open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. 
 Securities Issuances 
In March 2011, the Company issued 25,010 shares of Class A, 

Series I Preferred Stock, with a par value of $2.5 billion to 
Wachovia Capital Trust III (Trust), an unconsolidated wholly 
owned trust. The Trust used the 
proceeds from the remarketing 
of certain junior subordinated notes issued in connection with 
Wachovia™s 2006 issuance of 5.80% fixed
-to-floating rate trust 
preferred securities to purchase the Series I Preferred Stock. The 
action completed the Company™
s and the Trust™s obligations 
under an agreement dated February 1, 2006, as amended, 

between the Trust and the Compan
y (as successor to Wachovia 
Corporation).

 aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is 
then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categor
ies are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets.

  86  Regulatory Reform 
 The past two years have witnessed a significant increase in 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives that may 
substantially change how most U.S. financial services companies 
conduct business. The following highlights the more significant 
regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have 

affected or may affect our business. For additional information 
about the regulatory reform matters discussed below and other 
regulations and regulatory oversight matters, see Part I, Item 1 

ﬁRegulation and Supervisionﬂ of our 2011 Form 10
-K, and the 
ﬁCapital Management,ﬂ ﬁForward
-Looking Statementsﬂ and 
ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ sections
 and Note 26 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
 Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act is the most
 significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s and is
 driving much of the current 
U.S. regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Act and many of its 
provisions became effective in July 2010 and July 2011. 
However, a number of its provisions still require extensive 

rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by regulatory 
authorities and many of the rules 
that have been proposed to 
implement its requirements remain open for public comment 
and have not been finalized. Wh
ere possible, the Company may, 
from time to time, estimate 
the impact to the Company™s 
financial results or business operations as a result of particular 

Dodd-Frank Act regulations. However, due to the uncertainty of 

pending regulations, the Compan
y may be unable to make any 
such estimates. Accordingly, in many respects the ultimate 

impact of the Dodd-Frank Act 
and its effects on the U.S. 
financial system and the Company still remain uncertain. The 

following provides additional information on the Dodd-Frank 

Act, including the current status
 of certain of its rulemaking 
initiatives. 

  Regulation of interchange fees (the Durbin Amendment)
. On October 1, 2011, FRB rules limiting debit card interchange 

fees to those "reasonable" and "proportional" to the 

transactions became effective. 
The rule generally established 
that the maximum permissible in
terchange fee that an issuer 
may receive for an electronic 
debit transaction will be the 
sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied 
by the value of the transaction. 
An additional charge of up to 
1 cent may be added if the issuer develops and implements 
fraud prevention policies and procedures that meet 
regulation standards. A
s a result of the FRB™s new rules, 
our 
fourth quarter 2011 debit card interchange fees were reduced 
by $365 million (pre-tax).   
 Interest on business chec
king (Regulation Q repeal)
. Effective July 21, 2011, banks are permitted to pay interest on 

business checking accounts
. We made changes to our 
affected products in anticipation
 of the repeal of Regulation 
Q. To date, our product changes and the repeal of Regulation 
Q have had a minimal impact on our business because of the 
low interest rate environment.   
 Asset-based deposit assessment base; other FDIC 
assessment changes
. In 2011, the FDIC finalized regulations 
to implement the provision of 
the Dodd-Frank Act requiring 
a shift from deposits to assets as the basis for determining 

FDIC assessments. In addition
, the FDIC approved changes 
to its assessment rates to implement a new minimum 

designated reserve ratio and impose separate risk-based 

assessments on large banks. The FDIC has broad 
discretionary authority to in
crease assessments on large 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo on a case by case 
basis.   
 Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities
. The 
Dodd-Frank Act establishes a comprehensive framework for 

regulating over-the-counter derivatives. Included in this 
frame
work are certain ﬁpush
-outﬂ provisions affecting U.S. 
banks acting as dealers in 
commodity swaps, equity swaps 
and certain credit default swaps, which will require that these 
activities be conducted through an affiliate. It also authorizes 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the 
SEC to regulate swaps and security-based swaps respectively. 
During 2011, the CFTC and SEC 
proposed rules to implement 
derivatives regulation, including clearing and trading 
requirements, data retention and reporting requirements, 
registration requirements, capital and margin requirements, 

business conduct standards, and customer eligibility 
requirements. At this time, the Company cannot predict the 
financial impact of the rules 
to our swaps and securities-
based swaps activities or estimate the costs of complying 

with the rules.  
 Volcker Rule. 
The Volcker Rule will prohibit banking entities 
from engaging in proprietary tr
ading or owning any interest 
in or sponsoring a hedge fund or a private equity fund. In 

October 2011, federal banking 
agencies and the SEC issued 
for public comment proposed regulations to implement the 
Volcker Rule. The comment period ended on 
February 13, 2012, and the Volcker Rule will become effective 

on July 21, 2012, regardless of the status of the rulemaking 
process. The proposed rules requested comments on over 
1,300 questions and it is difficult to predict the content of the 

final rules. Although proprietar
y trading is not significant to 
our financial results, and we have reduced or exited certain 

businesses in anticipation of the 
final rules, at this time the 
Company cannot predict the ultimate
 impact of the Volcker 
Rule on our trading and investment activities or financial 

results.   
 Changes to asset-backed securities markets. 
The Dodd-
Frank Act will generally require sponsors of asset-backed 

securities (ABS) to hold at least a 5% ownership stake in the 

ABS. Exemptions from the requirement include qualified 
residential mortgages and FHA/VA loans. Federal regulatory 
authorities have proposed joint 
rules to implement this credit 
risk retention requirement, which rules include an 
exemption for the GSE™s mortgage
-backed securities. The 
proposed rules have been su
bject to extensive public 
comment. At this time, the Company cannot predict the 

financial impact of the credit risk retention requirement on 
our business. 
87Regulatory Reform 
(continued) 
  The Collins Amendment. 
This provision of the Dodd-Frank 
Act will phase out the benefi
t of issuing trust preferred 
securities by eliminating them from Tier 1 capital over three 
years beginning January 2013. We
 redeemed $9.2 billion of 
our trust preferred securities in 2011 as discussed in the 
ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section of this Report.
  Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically 
significant firms
. The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad 
authority to banking regulato
rs to establish enhanced 
supervisory and regulatory requirements for systemically 

important firms. In December 2011, the FRB published 
proposed rules that would establish enhanced risk-based 
capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity 

requirements, counterparty credit exposure limits, risk 
management requirements, stress testing requirements, 
debt-to-equity limits, and early remediation requirements for 

large BHCs like Wells Fargo. The Dodd-Frank Act also 
establishes the Financial Servic
es Oversight Council and the 
Office of Financial Research, which may recommend new 
systemic risk management requirements and require new 
reporting of systemic risks.  
 Establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB).The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which 
became operational on July 21, 2011. The role of the CFPB is 
to ensure consumers get clear, accurate information to 
effectively evaluate mortgages, credit cards and other 
financial products and prot
ect them from hidden fees, 
abusive terms and deceptive pr
actices. The CFPB has broad 
rulemaking powers and supervisory and enforcement 
authority over consumer financial products and services. The 
CFPB has begun exercising its supervisory authority over the 

banks under its jurisdiction, including Wells Fargo, and is 
preparing for supervision of certain non-bank entities. The 
CFPB has indicated it will concentrate much of its 
rulemaking effort in 2012 on the variety of mortgage-related 
topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including the 

steering of consumers to cert
ain products, discrimination, 
abusive or unfair lending pr
actices, predatory lending, 
origination disclosures, minimum mortgage underwriting 

standards, and servicing prac
tices. The CFPB has published 
proposed regulations on several of these topics, including 

minimum mortgage underwriting standards (ability to 

repay). At this time, the Comp
any cannot predict the content 
of final CFPB regulations and impacts on our business 
practices or financial results. 
 Regulatory Capital Guidelines and Capital Plans  

In December 2010, the BCBS fina
lized Basel III for determining 
regulatory capital. When fully phased in by 2019, the Basel III 
standards will require BHCs to maintain a minimum ratio of 
Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%. In 
November 2011, the BCBS releas
ed its final rule for a common 
equity surcharge on certain designated G-SIBs. We have been 
named as one of the G-SIBs that will be subject to a surcharge, 
although the amount of the surc
harge, ranging from 1.0% to 
3.5%, has not been determined. Th
e FRB has indicated it expects 
to adopt regulations implementing
 the G-SIB surcharge in 2014 
and that the surcharge would be
 imposed on a phased-in basis 
from 2016-2019. In late 2011, the FRB finalized rules to require 
BHCs with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets to submit 
capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval before 
making capital distributions. The rule also requires a capital 

adequacy assessment under a ra
nge of expected and stress 
scenarios. F
or additional information, see the ﬁCapital 
Managementﬂ section of this Report.
  
ﬁLiving Willﬂ Requirements
  In late 2011 the FRB and the FD
IC approved final resolution-
plan regulations as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. These 

regulations will require large financial institutions, including 

Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically revise plans that would 
facilitate their resolution in the event of material distress or 
failure. As contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, resolution 

plans are to provide for a rapid and orderly resolution 
Œ liquidation or orderly restructuring 
Œ under Bankruptcy Code 
and other insolvency statutes appl
icable to particular types of 
regulated entities (such as securities broker-dealers or insurance 

companies).  
  88  Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial conditio
n because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that
 may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are 
critical because they require 
management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern:  
 the allowance for credit losses;  
 PCI loans;  
 the valuation of residential MSRs; 
 liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses;  
 the fair valuation of financial instruments; and 
 income taxes.  
Management has reviewed an
d approved these critical 
accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the 

Board™s Audi
t and Examination Committee. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses  
The allowance for credit losses, 
which consists of the allowance 
for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit 

commitments, is 
management™s 
estimate of credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio at
 the balance sheet date, excluding 
loans carried at fair value. We develop and document our 

allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level. Our loan 

portfolio consists of a commercial loan portfolio segment and a 
consumer loan portfolio segment. 
We employ a disciplined process and methodology to 
establish our allowance for credit losses. The total allowance for 
credit losses considers both impaired and unimpaired loans. 
While our methodology attributes 
portions of the allowance to 
specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses 
is available to absorb credit l
osses inherent in the total loan 
portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. No single statistic 
or measurement determines the 
adequacy of the allowance for 
credit losses. 
 COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO SEGMENT
  The allowance for credit 
losses for unimpaired commercial loans is estimated through the 

application of loss factors to loans based on credit risk ratings for 
each loan. In addition, the allowance for credit losses for 
unfunded commitments, including le
tters of credit, is estimated 
by applying these loss factors to loan equivalent exposures. The 
loss factors reflect the estimated default probability and quality 
of the underlying collateral. The 
loss factors used are statistically 
derived through the observation of 
historical losses incurred for 
loans within each credit risk rating over a relevant specified 

period of time. As appropriate, we adjust or supplement these 
loss factors and estimates to re
flect other risks that may be 
identified from current conditions and developments in selected 
portfolios.  

 The allowance also includes an amount for estimated credit 

losses on impaired loans such as nonaccrual loans and loans that 
have been modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. 
 CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENT
  Loans are pooled generally 
by product type with similar risk characteristics. Losses are 

estimated using forecasted losses to represent our best estimate 
of inherent loss based on historical experience, quantitative and 
other mathematical techniques ov
er the loss emergence period. 
Each business group exercises significant judgment in the 
determination of the credit loss 
estimation model that fits the 
credit risk characteristics of its portfolio. We use both internally 
developed and vendor supplied mode
ls in this process. We often 
use roll rate or net flow models for near-term loss projections, 

and vintage-based models, behavior score models, and time 

series or statistical trend models for longer-term projections. 
Management must use judgment in establishing additional input 
metrics for the modeling proc
esses, considering further 
stratification into sub-product, origination channel, vintage, loss 

type, geographic location and other predictive characteristics. In 

addition, we establish an allowance for consumer loans modified 
in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual status.  
The models used to determine the allowance are validated by 
an independent internal model validation group operating in 

accordance with Company policies. 
 OTHER ACL MATTERS
  The allowance for credit losses for both 
portfolio segments includes an
 amount for imprecision or 
uncertainty that may change from
 period to period. This amount 
represents management™s judgment of risks inherent in the 
processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. 
This imprecision considers economic environmental factors, 

modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other 
subjective factors, including industry trends and ongoing 
discussions with regulatory and government agencies regarding 

mortgage foreclosure-related matters. 
 Impaired loans, which predominantly include nonaccrual 
commercial loans and any loans that have been modified in a 

TDR, have an estimated allowance 
calculated as the difference, if 
any, between the impaired valu
e of the loan and the recorded 
investment in the loan. The im
paired value of the loan is 
generally calculated as the present value of expected future cash 
flows from principal and interest, which incorporates expected 
lifetime losses, discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate. 

The allowance for an unimpaired loan is based solely on 
principal losses without consideration for timing of those losses. 
The allowance for an impaired lo
an that was modified in a TDR 
may be lower than the previously established allowance for that 
loan due to benefits received through modification, such as lower 
probability of default and/or severity of loss, and the impact of 

prior charge-offs or charge-offs at
 the time of the modification 
that may reduce or eliminat
e the need for an allowance. 
 Commercial and consumer PCI loans may require an 

allowance subsequent to their acquisition. This allowance 
requirement is due to probable decreases in expected principal 
and interest cash flows (other than due to decreases in interest 

rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions). 
89Critical Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES
  Changes in the allowance for credit 
losses and, therefore, in the 
related provision expense can 
materially affect net income. The 
establishment of the allowance 
for credit losses relies on a consistent quarterly process that 
requires significant management review and judgment. 
Management considers change
s in economic conditions, 
customer behavior, and collateral value, among other influences. 
From time to time, economic factors or business decisions, such 
as the addition or liquidation of
 a loan product or business unit, 
may affect the loan portfolio, causing management to provide or 
release amounts from the allowance for credit losses.  
The allowance for credit losses for commercial loans, 
including unfunded credit commitments (individually risk 

weighted) is sensitive to credit risk ratings assigned to each 
credit exposure. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated 
based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and 

are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of 
credit specialists.  
The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans 
(statistically modeled) is sensit
ive to economic assumptions and 
delinquency trends. Forecasted lo
sses are modeled using a range 
of economic scenarios.  
Assuming a one risk rating downgrade throughout our 
commercial portfolio segment, a more pessimistic economic 
outlook for modeled losses on our consumer portfolio segment 
and incremental deterioration in
 our PCI portfolio could imply 
an additional allowance requirement of approximately 
$11.0 billion.  
Assuming a one risk rating upgrade throughout our 
commercial portfolio segment and a more optimistic economic 

outlook for modeled losses on our consumer portfolio segment 

could imply a reduced allowance requirement of approximately 
$3.1 billion.  
The sensitivity analyses provid
ed are hypothetical scenarios 
and are not considered probable. They do not represent 
management™s view of inherent
 losses in the portfolio as of the 
balance sheet date. Because significant judgment is used, it is 
possible that others performing similar analyses could reach 
different conclusions. 
See the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Managementﬂ 
section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to 

Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of our 

allowance.  
 Purchased Credit-Impaired (PCI) Loans  
Loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their 
origination and where it is probab
le that we will not collect all 
contractually required principal and interest payments are 
accounted for using the measurem
ent provision for PCI loans.  
PCI loans are recorded at fair valu
e at the date of acquisition, and 
the historical allowance for credit 
losses related to these loans is 
not carried over. Such loans are co
nsidered to be accruing due to 
the existence of the accretab
le yield and not based on 
consideration given to contractual interest payments.  

Substantially all of our PCI loans 
were acquired in the Wachovia 
acquisition on December 31, 2008.   
Management evaluated whether there was evidence of credit 
quality deterioration as of the 
purchase date using indicators 
such as past due and nonaccrual 
status, commercial risk ratings, 
recent borrower credit scores and recent loan-to-value 

percentages.  
The fair value at acquisition was 
based on an estimate of cash 
flows, both principal and interest, expected to be collected, 

discounted at the prevailing market rate of interest. We 
estimated the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition 

using our internal credit risk, interest rate risk and prepayment 
risk models, which incorporate our best estimate of current key 
assumptions, such as property values, default rates, loss severity 

and prepayment speeds.  
Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign 
PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, Pick-

a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated into 
several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each pool is 
accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest 

rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. 
The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the 
carrying value (estimated fair value at acquisition date) is 
referred to as the accretable yiel
d and is recognized in interest 
income using an effective yield me
thod over the remaining life of 
the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a 
reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash 
flows expected to be collected. The difference between the 

contractually required payments 
and the cash flows expected to 
be collected at acquisition, considering the impact of 

prepayments, is referred to as
 the nonaccretable difference.  
Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our estimates 
of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, 
performed quarterly, require the continued usage of key 
assumptions and estimates, similar 
to our initial estimate of fair 
value. We must apply judgment to develop our estimates of cash 
flows for PCI loans given the impact of home price and property 
value changes, changing loss severi
ties, modification activity, and 
prepayment speeds.  
If we have probable decreases 
in cash flows expected to be 
collected (other than due to decreases in interest rate indices and 
changes in prepayment assumpti
ons), we charge the provision 
for credit losses, resulting in an 
increase to the allowance for loan 
losses. If we have probable and significant increases in cash flows 

expected to be collected, we
 first reverse any previously 
established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest 
income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life 

of the loan, or pool of loans. Esti
mates of cash flows are impacted 
by changes in interest rate indi
ces for variable rate loans and 
prepayment assumptions, both
 of which are treated as 
prospective yield adjustments included in interest income.  
Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third 
parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or 
foreclosure of the collateral. Our policy is to remove an 
individual loan from a pool based on comparing the amount 

received from its resolution with its contractual amount. Any 
difference between these amoun
ts is absorbed by the 
nonaccretable difference for th
e entire pool. This removal 
method assumes that the amoun
t received from resolution 
approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining 
accretable yield balance is unaffe
cted and any material change in 
remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is 
90  addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each 
pool. For loans that are resolved 
by payment in full, there is no 
release of the nonaccretable diffe
rence for the pool because there 
is no difference between the amount received at resolution and 
the contractual amount of the lo
an. Modified PCI loans are not 
removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be 
deemed TDRs. Modified PCI lo
ans that are accounted for 
individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI 
accounting if there has been a conc
ession granted in excess of the 
original nonaccretable difference. We include these TDRs in our 
impaired loans. 
The amount of cash flows expe
cted to be collected and, 
accordingly, the adequacy of the 
allowance for loan loss due to 
certain decreases in cash flows expected to be collected, is 
particularly sensitive to changes in loan credit quality. The 
sensitivity of the overall allowance for credit losses, including 

PCI loans, is presented in the prece
ding section, ﬁCritical 
Accounting Policies 
Œ Allowance f
or Credit Losses.ﬂ
 See the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Management
ﬂ section and Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to 

Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of PCI 

loans. 
 Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights  
MSRs are assets that represent 
the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MS
Rs when we purchase servicing 
rights from third parties, or reta
in servicing rights in connection 
with the sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset 
transfers). We also have MSRs 
acquired in the past under co-
issuer agreements that provide fo
r us to service loans that were 
originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. We 

initially measure and carry substantially all of our MSRs related 
to residential mortgage loans at fair value.    
At the end of each quarter, we determine the fair value of 
MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value 
of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates 

assumptions that market participants use in estimating future 
net servicing income, including es
timates of prepayment speeds 
(including housing price volatility), discount rates, default rates, 
cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), 
escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, 
ancillary income and late fees.  
Net servicing income, a component of mortgage banking 
noninterest income, includes the changes from period to period 
in fair value of both our residential MSRs and the free-standing 
derivatives (economic hedges) used to hedge our residential 
MSRs. Changes in the fair value of
 residential MSRs from period 
to period result from (1) changes 
in the valuation model inputs or 
assumptions (principally reflecting changes in discount rates and 
prepayment speed assumptions, mostly due to changes in 
interest rates and costs to service, including delinquency and 

foreclosure costs), and (2) other 
changes, representing changes 
due to collection/realization of expected cash flows over time. 
We use a dynamic and sophisti
cated model to estimate the 
value of our MSRs. The model is validated by an independent 
internal model validation group operating in accordance with 
Company policies. Senior management reviews all significant 

assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speed 
Œ a key 
assumption in the model 
Œ is the annual rate at which borrowers 
are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal. The 
discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated 
future net servicing income 
Œ another key assumption in the 
model 
Œ is the required rate of re
turn investors in the market 
would expect for an asset with similar risk. To determine the 
discount rate, we consider the risk premium for uncertainties 

from servicing operations (e.g
., possible changes in future 
servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on escrow 
accounts). Both assumptions can, and generally will, change 

quarterly as market conditions and interest rates change. For 
example, an increase in either th
e prepayment speed or discount 
rate assumption results in a decr
ease in the fair value of the 
MSRs, while a decrease in either assumption would result in an 

increase in the fair value of the 
MSRs. In recent years, there have 
been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment 
speeds and the discount rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and 
may be significant in the future. Therefore, estimating 
prepayment speeds within a ra
nge that market participants 
would use in determining the fair value of MSRs requires 

significant management judgment. Additionally, in recent years, 

we have made significant adjustments to the assumptions for 
servicing and foreclosure costs as a result of an increase in the 
number of defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing 

processes associated with default and foreclosure management.  
While our current valuation reflec
ts our best estimate of these 
costs, future regulatory changes in servicing standards may have 
an impact on these assumptions and our MSR valuation in future 

periods.   
The valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 

(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) and No
te 17 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.  
 Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses 
We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including 
(1) GSEs, which include the mort
gage loans in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, (2) special purpose entities that issue 
private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that 
purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label 
securitization. In addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-

guaranteed mortgage loans, which back securities guaranteed by 

GNMA. The agreements under which we sell mortgage loans and 

the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain 

provisions that include various representations and warranties 
regarding the origination and characteristics of the mortgage 
loans. Although the specific repr
esentations and warranties vary 
among different sales, insurance 
or guarantee agreements, they 
typically cover ownership of the loan, compliance with loan 

criteria set forth in the applicable
 agreement, validity of the lien 
securing the loan, absence of delinquent taxes or liens against 
the property securing the loan, compliance with applicable 
origination laws, and other matters. For more information about 
these loan sales and the related risks that may result in liability 
see the 
ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Management 
Œ Liability 
for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Lossesﬂ 
section in this Report. 
91Critical Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
  We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify 
the securitization trust, investor
 or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively ﬁrepurchaseﬂ) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or wa
rranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 

the breach. Our loan sale contra
cts to private investors (non-
GSE) typically contain an additi
onal provision where we would 
only be required to repurchase loans if any such breach is 

deemed to have a material and adve
rse effect on the value of the 
mortgage loan or to the interests of the investors or interests of 
security holders in the mortgage loan. The time periods specified 
in our mortgage loan sales contracts to respond to repurchase 

requests vary, but are generall
y 90 days or less. While many 
contracts do not include specific 
remedies if the applicable time 
period for a response is not met, contracts for mortgage loan 

sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and 
penalties that could be applied to inadequate responses to 
repurchase requests. Similarly, the agreements under which we 
sell mortgage loans require us to deliver various documents to 
the securitization trust or invest
or, and we may be obligated to 
repurchase any mortgage loan for which the required documents 
are not delivered or are defective.
 In addition, as part of our 
representations and warranties in our loan sales contracts, we 
typically represent to GSEs and 
private investors that certain 
loans have mortgage insurance to 
the extent there are loans that 
have loan to value ratios in ex
cess of 80% that require mortgage 
insurance. To the extent the mort
gage insurance is rescinded by 
the mortgage insurer due to a cl
aim of breach of a contractual 
representation or warranty, the lack of insurance may result in a 

repurchase demand from an investor. Upon receipt of a 

repurchase request or a mortgage insurance rescission, we work 
with securitization trusts, invest
ors or insurers to arrive at a 
mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically 
reviewed on an individual loan by
 loan basis to validate the 
claims made by the securitization trust, investor or insurer, and 
to determine whether a contractually required repurchase event 
occurred. Occasionally, in lieu of conducting a loan level 
evaluation, we may negotiate global settlements in order to 

resolve a pipeline of demands in lieu of repurchasing the loans. 
We manage the risk associated 
with potential repurchases or 
other forms of settlement throug
h our underwriting and quality 
assurance practices and by serv
icing mortgage loans to meet 
investor and secondary market standards. 
We establish mortgage repurchase liabilities related to 
various representations and 
warranties that reflect 
management™s estimate of losses for loans for whi
ch we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service 
those loans, based on a combinat
ion of factors. Such factors 
include default expectations, expected investor repurchase 

demands (influenced by current and expected mortgage loan file 

requests and mortgage insurance rescission notices, as well as 
estimated demand to default and file request relationships) and 
appeals success rates (where the 
investor rescinds the demand 
based on a cure of the defect 
or acknowledges that the loan 
satisfies the investor™s appl
icable representations and 
warranties), reimbursement by correspondent and other third 
party originators, and projected loss severity. We establish a 
liability at the time loans are sold and continually update our 
liability estimate during the remaining life of such loans. 

Although investors may demand repurchase at any time and 
there is often a lag from the date 
of default to the time we receive 
a repurchase demand, the majority of repurchase demands occur 
on loans that default in the first 24 to 36 months following 
origination of the mortgage loan 
and can vary by investor. Most 
repurchases under our representation and warranty provisions 
are attributable to borrower misrepresentations and appraisals 
obtained at origination that inve
stors believe do not fully comply 
with applicable industry standards.  
To date, repurchase demands from private label MBS have 
been more limited than GSE-guaranteed securities; however, it is 

possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans in private 
label securitizations may increase in frequency as investors 
explore every possible avenue to recover losses on their 

securities. We evaluate the validity and materiality of any claim 
of breach of representations and warranties in private label MBS 
that is brought to our attention and work with securitization 
trustees to resolve any repurchase requests. Nevertheless, we 
may be subject to legal and other expenses if private label 

securitization trustees or inve
stors choose to commence legal 
proceedings in the event of disagreements.  

 The mortgage loan repurchase liability at December 31, 2011, 

represents our best estimate of the probable loss that we may 
incur for various representati
ons and warranties in the 
contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses are dependent on 
economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external 
conditions that may change over 
the life of the underlying loans, 
the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is 
difficult to estimate and requires considerable management 
judgment. We maintain regular contact with the GSEs and other 
significant investors to monitor and address their repurchase 
demand practices and concerns. Fo

our repurchase liability, including an adverse impact analysis,

Report.
  Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments 
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value 
disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, 

derivatives, prime residential MHFS, certain commercial LHFS, 
certain loans held for investment, principal investments and 
securities sold but not yet purchased (short sale liabilities) are 

recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from 
time to time, we may be required
 to record at fair value other 
assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as certain MHFS and LHFS, 
loans held for investment and certain other assets. These 
nonrecurring fair value adjustme
nts typically involve application 
of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of 
individual assets. Additionally, for financial instruments not 
recorded at fair value we disclose 
the estimate of their fair value.  
Fair value represents 
the price that would be received to sell 
the financial asset or paid to tran
sfer the financial liability in an 
92  orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.  
The accounting provisions for fair value measurements 
include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is
 based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used 
for measurement are observable 
or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or 

market-based information obtained from independent sources, 
while unobservable inputs refl
ect our estimates about market 
data.   Level 1 
Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical 
instruments traded in active markets. Level 1 instruments 

include securities traded on active exchange markets, such 
as the New York Stock Exchange
, as well as U.S. Treasury 
and other U.S. government secu
rities that are traded by 
dealers or brokers in active OTC markets.  
 Level 2 
Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar
 instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or 

similar instruments in markets
 that are not active, and 
model-based valuation techniques, such as matrix pricing, 
for which all significant assumptions are observable in the 
market. Level 2 instruments include securities traded in 
functioning dealer or broker markets, plain-vanilla interest 

rate derivatives and MHFS that
 are valued based on prices 
for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics.  
 Level 3 
Œ Valuation is generated primarily from model-
based techniques that use 
significant assumptions not 
observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions 
reflect our own estimates of assumptions market 
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, 
discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.  
When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quot
ed prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted pr
ices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that use 

primarily market-based or independently sourced market 

parameters, including interest 
rate yield curves, prepayment 
speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. However, in 
certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based 
valuation techniques are not readily available, we are required to 
make judgments about assumptions market participants would 
use to estimate the fair value. 
The degree of management judgme
nt involved in determining 
the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the 

availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable 
market parameters. For financial instruments with quoted 
market prices or observable market parameters in active 

markets, there is minimal subjecti
vity involved in measuring fair 
value. When quoted prices and ob
servable data in active markets 
are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to 
estimate fair value. Changes in
 the market conditions, such as 
reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary 
market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of 
quoted prices or observable data
 used to determine fair value. 
When significant adjustments are required to price quotes or 
inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based 
primarily on unobservable inputs. When an active market for a 

financial instrument does not exist, the use of management 
estimates that incorporate 
current market participant 
expectations of future cash flows, adjusted for an appropriate 
risk premium, is acceptable.  
When markets for our financial assets and liabilities become 
inactive because the level and volume of activity has declined 

significantly relative to normal conditions, it may be appropriate 
to adjust quoted prices. The methodology we use to adjust the 

quoted prices generally involves weighting the quoted prices and 
results of internal pricing tech
niques, such as the net present 
value of future expected cash flows (with observable inputs, 
where available) discounted at a rate of return market 
participants require to arrive at 
the fair value. The more active 
and orderly markets for particular security classes are 
determined to be, the more weight
ing we assign to quoted prices. 
The less active and orderly markets 
are determined to
 be, the less 
weighting we assign to quoted prices. 
We may use independent pricing services and brokers 
(collectively, ﬁpricing vendorsﬂ) to obtain fair values (ﬁvendor 

pric
esﬂ) which are used to either record the price of an 
instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices. For 

certain securities, we may use internal traders to price 

instruments. Where vendor prices
 are utilized for recording the 
price of an instrument, we dete
rmine the most appropriate and 
relevant pricing vendor for each security class and obtain a price 

from that particular pricing 
vendor for each security.   
Determination of the fair value of financial instruments using 
either vendor prices or intern
ally developed prices are both 
subject to our internal price validation procedures, which 

include, but are not limited to
, one or a combination of the 
following procedures: 
 comparison to pricing vendors (for internally developed 
prices) or to other pricing vendors (for vendor developed 
prices); 
  variance analysis of prices; 
  corroboration of pricing by re
ference to other independent 
market data such as secondary broker quotes and relevant 

benchmark indices; 
  review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with 

market liquidity and other market-related conditions; and
  investigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-
instrument basis.  
 For instruments where we utilize 
vendor prices to record the 
price of an instrument, we perform additional procedures. We 
evaluate pricing vendors by compar
ing prices from one vendor to 
prices of other vendors for identical or similar instruments and 
evaluate the consistency of pric
es to known market transactions 
when determining the level of reliance to be placed on a 

particular pricing vendor. Meth
odologies employed and inputs 
used by independent pricing vendors are subject to additional 
review when such services are provided. This review may consist 
of, in part, obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and 
pricing methodology materials distributed.
    Significant judgment is required to determine whether 
certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or 

Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider all available 
93Critical Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 information, including observable market data, indications of 
market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the 

valuation techniques and significant inputs used. For securities 
in inactive markets, we use a 
predetermined percentage to 
evaluate the impact of fair 
value adjustments derived from 
weighting both external and internal indications of value to 
determine if the instrument is cl
assified as Level 2 or Level 3. 
Otherwise, the classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon 
the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or 
instrument category and judgments are made regarding the 

significance of the 
Level 3 inputs to the instruments™ fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If 
Level 3 inputs are considered 
significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. 
Our financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements 
consisted of certain asset-backed securities, including those 

collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves, private 

collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), 
auction-rate securities, certain derivative contracts such as credit 
default swaps related to CMO,
 CDO and CLO exposures and 
certain MHFS and MSRs. For additional information on how we 
value MSRs refer to the discussi
on earlier in this section. 
Table 46 presents the summary of
 the fair value of financial 
instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the 
amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before 
derivative netting adjustments). 
The fair value of the remaining 
assets and liabilities were measured using valuation 
methodologies involving market-based or market-derived 

information, collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements.

fair valuation of financial instruments, our related measurement 

techniques and the impact to our financial statements. 
 Income Taxes  
We are subject to the income tax 
laws of the U.S., its states and 
municipalities and those of the fo
reign jurisdictions in which we 
operate. Our income tax expens
e consists of two components: 
current and deferred. Current in
come tax expense approximates 
taxes to be paid or refunded fo
r the current period and includes 
income tax expense related to ou
r uncertain tax positions. We 
determine deferred income ta
xes using the balance sheet 
method. Under this method, the net 
deferred tax asset or liability 
is based on the tax ef
fects of the differences between the book 
and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted 
changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they 
occur. Deferred income tax ex
pense results from changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax 
assets are recognized subject 
to management™s judgment that 
realization is ﬁmore likely than not.ﬂ Uncertain tax positions that 
meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are 
measured to determine 
the amount of benefit to recognize. An 
uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of 
benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% 
likelihood of realization upon settlement. Foreign taxes paid are 

generally applied as credits to reduce federal income taxes 
payable. We account for interest 
and penalties as a component of 
income tax expense. 
The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which 
we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations 
by the taxpayer and the relevant 
government taxing authorities. 
In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must 

make judgments and interpretati
ons about the application of 
these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates 

about when in the future certain 
items will affect taxable income 
in the various tax jurisdiction
s by the government taxing 
authorities, both domestic and foreign. Our interpretations may 

be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities 
and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. We 
attempt to resolve these disputes
 during the tax examination and 
audit process and ultimately through the court systems when 
applicable. 
We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of 
accrued income taxes due to ch
anges in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 

taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and 

from the resolution of income ta
x controversies. Such revisions 
in our estimates may be material to our operating results for any 

given quarter. 
See Note 21 (Income Taxes) to 
Financial Statements in this 
Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 

and related income tax assets and liabilities.
 94  Current Accounting Developments 
 The following accounting pronouncements have been issued by 
the FASB but are not yet effective: 
  Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2011-11, 

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities; 
 ASU 2011-05, 
Presentation of Comprehensive Income;
  ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for 
Amendments to the Presentati
on of Reclassifications of 
Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in 
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05;
  ASU 2011-04, 
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value 
Measurement and Disclosure Re
quirements in U.S. GAAP 
and IFRSs; 
and 
 ASU 2011-03, Reconsideration of Effective Control for 
Repurchase Agreements.
  ASU 2011-11 
expands the disclosure requirements for financial 
instruments and derivatives that may be offset in accordance 
with enforceable master netting agreements or similar 

arrangements. The disclosures are required regardless of 
whether the instruments have been offset (or netted) in the 
statement of financial position. Under ASU 2011-11, companies 

must describe the nature of offsetting arrangements and provide 
quantitative information about those agreements, including the 
gross and net amounts of financial instruments that are 

recognized in the statement of 
financial position. These changes 
are effective for us in first quarter 2013 with retrospective 
application. This Update will 
not affect our consolidated 
financial results since it amends only the disclosure 
requirements for offsetting financial instruments.
  ASU 2011-05
 eliminates the option for companies to include 
the components of other comprehe
nsive income in the statement 
of changes in stockholders™ equity.
 This Update requires entities 
to present the components of co
mprehensive income in either a 
single statement or in two separate statements, with the 

statement of other comprehens
ive income (OCI) immediately 
following the statement of income. This Update also requires 
companies to present amounts reclassified out of OCI and into 
net income on the face of the st
atement of income. In December 
2011, the FASB issued 
ASU 2011-12
, which defers indefinitely 
the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the 

statement of income. The remaining provisions are effective for 

us in first quarter 2012 with retrospective application. Early 
adoption is permitted. This Update will not affect our 
consolidated financial results as it amends only the presentation 

of comprehensive income. 
 ASU 2011-04
 modifies accounting guidance and expands 
existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. 
This Update clarifies how fair values should be measured for 
instruments clas
sified in stockholders™ equity and under what 
circumstances premiums and discounts should be applied in fair 
value measurements. This Update also permits entities to 
measure fair value on a net basis for financial instruments that 
are managed based on net exposure to market risks and/or 

counterparty credit risk. ASU 2011-04 requires new disclosures 
for financial instruments classified as Level 3, including: 1) 
quantitative information about 
unobservable inputs used in 
measuring fair value, 2) qualitat
ive discussion of the sensitivity 
of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs, 
and 3) a description of valuatio
n processes used. This Update 
also requires disclosure of fair value levels for financial 
instruments that are not recorded 
at fair value but for which fair 
value is required to be disclosed. 
This guidance is effective for us 
in first quarter 2012 with prospe
ctive application. Early adoption 
is not permitted. We will expand 
our fair value disclosures upon 
adoption of this Update, but we do not expect the measurement 

clarifications will have a material effect on our consolidated 
financial statements. 

 ASU 2011-03
 amends the criteria compan
ies use to determine if 
repurchase and similar agreements should be accounted for as 
sales or financings. Specifically, this Update removes the 

criterion for transferors to have 
the ability to meet contractual 
obligations through collateral maintenance provisions, even if 

transferees fail to return transferred assets pursuant to the 
agreements. This Update is effect
ive for us in first quarter 2012 
with prospective application to 
new transactions and existing 
transactions modified on or afte
r January 1, 2012. Early adoption 
is not permitted. We do not expect this Update will have a 
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
95  Forward-Looking Statements

plans, objectives and strategies, including our belief that we have 

more opportunity to increase cross-sell of our products. 
Forward-looking statements are based on our current 
expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the 

economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking 
statements relate to the future,
 they are subject to inherent 
uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are 
difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from 
those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We 
caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-

looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact 
nor guarantees or assurances of
 future performance. While there 
is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk 
factors is complete, important fa
ctors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking 
statements include the following, without limitation: 
 current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of furthe
r declines in housing prices 
and high unemployment rates, U.
 S. fiscal debt and budget 
matters, and the sovereign de
bt crisis in Europe;  
 our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, su
ch as the proposed Basel III 
capital standards, as determined and interpreted by 
applicable regulatory authorities) and our ability to generate 
capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 
 financial services reform and other current, pending or 
future legislation or regulation that could have a negative 
effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-

Frank Act and legislation and regulation relating to 
overdraft fees (and changes to our overdraft practices as a 
result thereof), debit card interchange fees, credit cards, and 

other bank services, as well as
 the extent of our ability to 
offset the loss of revenue and 
income from financial services 
reform and other legislation and regulation; 
 the extent of our success in our loan modification efforts, as 
well as the effects of regulato
ry requirements or guidance 
regarding loan modifications or changes in such 
requirements or guidance; 
 the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we 
receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without 
having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise 
indemnify or reimburs
e third parties, and the credit quality 
of or losses on such repurchased mortgage loans; 
 negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing and 

foreclosure practices, including our ability to meet our 

obligations under the settlem
ent in principle with the 

Department of Justice and other federal and state 
government entities, as well as changes in our procedures or 
practices and/or industry standards or practices, regulatory 
or judicial requirements, penalties or fines, increased 
servicing and other costs or obligations, including loan 

modification requirements, or delays or moratoriums on 
foreclosures; 
 our ability to realize our noninterest expense target as part 
of our expense management initiatives when and in the 
amount targeted, including as a result of business and 
economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business 

composition and operating environment, growth in our 
businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses 
relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory 

matters;  our ability to successfully complete the remaining Wachovia 

integration activities, as well 
as realize all of the expected 
benefits of the Wachovia merger; 
 recognition of OTTI on securities held in our available-for-

sale portfolio;  
 the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, MSRs and MHFS;  
 hedging gains or losses; 
 disruptions in the capital mar
kets and reduced investor 
demand for mortgage loans;  
 our ability to sell more products to our customers;  
 the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 

banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses;  
 our election to provide support to our money market funds;  
96   changes in the value of our ve
nture capital investments;  
 changes in our accounting policies or in accounting 
standards or in how accounting
 standards are to be applied 
or interpreted;  
 mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; 
 changes in the Company™s credit
 ratings and changes in the 
credit quality of the Company™s customers or counterparties; 
  reputational damage from negative publicity, protests, fines, 

penalties and other ne
gative consequences from regulatory 
violations and legal actions;  
 a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 

or infrastructure, or those of
 our third party vendors and 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber 
attacks; 
 the loss of checking and savings account deposits to other 

investments such as the stoc
k market, and the resulting 
increase in our funding costs and impact on our net interest 
margin;  
 fiscal and monetary policies of the FRB; and 
 the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ in this Report. 
  In addition to the above factors,
 we also caution
 that there is no assurance that our allowance fo
r credit losses will be adequate 
to cover future credit losses, espe
cially if housing prices decline 
and unemployment worsens. Increases in loan charge-offs or in 

the allowance for credit losses and related provision expense 
could materially adversely affect our financial results and 
condition. 

 Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Report 
speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events 
that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from 

time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. 
We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-
looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future 

developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. 
Risk Factors 
 An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 

investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 

and elsewhere in this Report, including under ﬁForward
-Looking 
Statementsﬂ and in our 2011 Form 10
-K, as well as in other 
documents we file with the SEC, risk factors that could adversely 
affect our financial results and condition and the value of, and 
return on, an investment in th
e Company. There may be other 
factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Report or in our 
2011 Form 10-K that could adversely affect our financial results 
and condition.   
 RISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST 
RATES AND LIQUIDITY
  As one of the largest lenders 
in the U.S. and a provider 
of financial products and services to consumers and 
businesses across the U.S. and internationally, our 
financial results have been, and will continue to be, 
materially
 affected by general economic conditions, 
particularly unemployment levels and home prices in 
the U.S., and a deterioration in economic conditions or 
in the financial markets may materially adversely affect 

our lending and other businesses and our financial 
results and condition.
 We generate revenue from the interest 
and fees we charge on the loans 
and other products and services 
we sell, and a substantial amount of our revenue and earnings 

comes from the net interest income
 and fee income that we earn 
from our consumer and commercial lending and banking 
businesses, including our mortgage banking business where we 
currently are the largest mortgage
 originator in the U.S. These 
businesses have been, and will cont
inue to be, materially affected 
by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment 
levels and home prices. Although the U.S. economy has 

continued to gradually improve from
 the levels of 2008 and early 
2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven and the 
housing market remains weak. In 
addition, the negative effects 
and continued uncertainty stemming from the sovereign debt 
crisis and economic difficulties 
in Europe and U. S. fiscal and 
political matters, including concerns about deficit reduction and 
U.S. debt ratings, have impacted
 and may continue to impact the 
continuing global economic recovery. A prolonged period of slow 
growth in the global economy, pa
rticularly in the U.S., or any 
deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the 

financial markets resulting from the above matters or any other 

events or factors that may di
srupt or dampen the global 
economic recovery
, could
 materially adversely affect our 
financial
 results and condition.
   The high unemployment rate in
 the U.S., together with high 
levels of unsold housing inventory and distressed property sales 

and the significant decline in 
home prices across the U.S., 
including in many of our larg
e banking markets such as 
California and Florida, has
 resulted in elevated credit costs and 
nonperforming asset levels, whic
h have adversely affected our 
credit performance and our financial results and condition. If 
unemployment levels worsen or if
 home prices continue to fall 
we would expect to incur higher than normal charge-offs and 
provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit 
losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer 
loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially 

for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries 
that may experience deteriorat
ing economic conditions. The 
ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may be 
hurt, causing us, as one of the 
largest commercial lenders and the 
largest CRE lender in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit 

losses. In addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions 

make it more challenging for us to increase our consumer and 
97Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy 
borrowers at attractive yields. 
Although we have significant 
capacity to add loans to our ba
lance sheet and there have been 
some early signs of increased borrower activity, loan demand, 
especially consumer loan demand, has been soft resulting in our 
retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets 
on our balance sheet. If economic conditions do not continue to 

improve or if the economy worsens and unemployment rises, 
which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and 
business confidence and spending, the demand for our credit 

products, including our mortgages, may fall, reducing our 
interest and fee income and our earnings.  
A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 
may erode consumer and investor
 confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including 

our investment advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, 
wealth management, and investment banking businesses.
 As a 
result of the Wachovia merger, a greater percentage of our 
revenue depends on our fee income from these businesses. We 
earn fee income from managing assets for others and providing 

brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth 
management services. Because investment management fees are 
often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in 

the market prices of those assets
 could reduce our fee income. 
Changes in stock market prices coul
d affect the trading activity of 
investors, reducing commissions an
d other fees we earn from our 
brokerage business. Poor economic conditions and volatile or 

unstable financial markets also can negatively affect our debt and 
equity underwriting and advisory
 businesses, as well as our 
trading and venture ca
pital businesses. Extr
eme market volatility 
also could cause us to elect to provide capital support to our 
money market funds, which would reduce our earnings. Our 
acquisition of Wachovia expanded our international businesses, 
particularly our global financial institution and correspondent 
banking services, and any deterioration in global financial 

markets and economies, including as a result of Europe™s 
sovereign debt crisis or any international political unrest or 
disturbances, may adversely affect the revenues and earnings of 

these and other businesses.

Changes in interest rates and financial market values 
could reduce our net interest income and earnings, 
including as a result of recognizing losses or OTTI on 
the securities that we hold in our portfolio or trade for 

our customers. 
Our net interest income is the interest we earn 
on loans, debt securities and other assets we hold less the 

interest we pay on our deposits, long-term and short-term debt, 

and other liabilities. Net interest 
income is a measure of both our 
net interest margin 
Œ the difference between the yield we earn on 
our assets and the interest rate 
we pay for deposits and our other 
sources of funding 
Œ and the amount of earning assets we hold. 
Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix 
of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income 

and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can affect our net 
interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our assets and 
our funding costs tend to move in
 the same direction in response 
to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the 
other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our 
liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they 
may adjust faster in response to 
changes in interest rates. When 
interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the 
yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to 
contract until the asset yield increases. 
 The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect our 
yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the form 

of loans and investment securities, among other assets. As noted 
above, if the economy remains weak or worsens we may see 

lower demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our 
net interest income and yield. In addition, our net interest 
income and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a 

prolonged low interest rate environment, which as noted below is 
currently being experienced as a result of economic conditions 
and FRB monetary policies, as it may result in us holding lower 
yielding loans and securities on our balance sheet, particularly if 
we are unable to replace the matur
ing higher yielding assets on 
our balance sheet, including the loans in our non-strategic and 
liquidating loan portfolio, with similar higher yielding assets. 
Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan 

demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers 
may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As 
described below, changes in interest rates also affect our 

mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs.   
Changes in the slope of
 the ﬁyield curveﬂ Œ
 or the spread 
between short-term and long-term interest rates 
Œ could also 
reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is 

upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-
term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration 

than our assets, when the yield curv
e flattens, as is 
the case in the 
current interest rate environment, or even inverts, our net 

interest margin could decrease as our cost of funds increases 

relative to the yield we can earn on our assets.  
The interest we earn on our loans may be tied to U.S.-
denominated interest rates such as the federal funds rate while 

the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international 
rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without 
a corresponding decrease in LI
BOR, we might earn less on our 
loans without any offsetting decrease in our funding costs. This 
could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. 
We assess our interest rate risk 
by estimating the effect on our 
earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slop
e of the yield curve. We hedge 
some of that interest rate risk wi
th interest rate derivatives. We 
also rely on the ﬁnatural hedgeﬂ that our mortga
ge loan 
originations and servicing rights can provide.  
We may not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There is always 
the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net 
interest income and our earnings in material amounts, especially 
if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what 
we assumed. For example, if interest rates rise or fall faster than 
we assumed or the slope of the yi
eld curve changes, we may incur 
significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments. To 
98  reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our investment 
and loan portfolios, refinance our debt and take other strategic 

actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions.  
We hold securities in our available-for-sale portfolio, 
including U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities and federal 

agency MBS, securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, 
residential and commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, and 

marketable equity securities, including securities relating to our 
venture capital activities. We analyze securities held in our 
available-for-sale portfolio for OTTI on at least a quarterly basis. 

The process for determining whet
her impairment is other than 
temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about 

the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral 

underlying the security in orde
r to assess the probability of 
receiving contractual principal 
and interest payments on the 
security. Because of changing economic and market conditions, 

as well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of 
the underlying collateral, we may 
be required to recognize OTTI 
in future periods, thus reducing 
earnings. Our net income also is 
exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodi
ty prices in connection with 
our trading activities, which 
are conducted primarily to 
accommodate our customers in the management of their market 

price risk, as well as when we take positions based on market 

expectations or to benefit from differences between financial 
instruments and markets. The securities held in these activities 
are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and 

losses recorded in noninterest income. As part of our business to 

support our customers, we trad
e public securities and these 
securities also are subject to ma
rket fluctuations with gains and 
losses recognized in net income when realized and periodically 

include OTTI charges. Although we have processes in place to 
measure and monitor the risks 
associated with our trading 
activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there 
can be no assurance that our pr
ocesses and strategies will be 
effective in avoiding losses that
 could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations.  
Our venture capital business also is subject to market risk and 
can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Certain of our venture 
capital businesses are carried un
der the cost or equity method, 
and others (e.g., principal invest
ments) are carried at fair value 
with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Our 

venture capital investments tend to be in technology and other 

volatile industries so the value 
of our public and private equity 
portfolios may fluctuate widely. Earnings from our venture 

capital investments may be volatile and hard to predict and may 
have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. 
When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of 

factors, including general economic and market conditions, the 
prospects of the companies in 
which we invest, when these 
companies go public, the size of
 our position relative to the 
public float, and whether we are subject to any resale 

restrictions.  
Our venture capital investments could result in significant 
losses, either OTTI losses for those investments carried under 

the cost or equity method or ma
rk-to-market losses for principal 
investments. Our assessment for OTTI is based on a number of 
factors, including the then current market value of each 
investment compared with its carrying value. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment
, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings. The 
amount of this charge could be si
gnificant. Further, our principal 
investing portfolio could incur significant mark-to-market losses 
especially if the carrying value 
of these investments has increased 
because of higher market prices.

 Effective liquidity management, which ensures that we 
can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit 

maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments 
efficiently under both normal
 operating conditions and 
other unpredictable circumstances of industry or 
financial market stress, is essential for the operation of 
our business, and our financial results and condition 

could be materially adversely affected if we do not 
effectively manage our liquidity. 
Our liquidity is essential 
for the operation of our business. We primarily rely on bank 
deposits to be a low cost and st
able source of funding for the 
loans we make and the operation of our business. Core customer 

deposits, which include noninter
est-bearing deposits, interest-
bearing checking, savings certificates, certain market rate and 

other savings, and certain foreign deposits, have historically 
provided us with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-
cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, our sources of 

liquidity include
 investments in our securities portfolio, our 
ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 

pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our abilit
y to raise funds in domestic 
and international money and capital markets. 

 Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 

volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to wh
at occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, 
which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 

inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 

disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the in
terest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 

that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 

interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other condit
ions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our 
liquidity and funding include a 
lack of market or customer co
nfidence in the Company or 
negative news about the Compan
y or the financial services 
industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits 
and/or negatively affect our abil
ity to access the capital markets; 
our inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and, as 

described below, reductions in one 
or more of our credit ratings. 
Many of the above conditions 
and factors may be caused by 
99Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 events over which we have litt
le or no control. While market 
conditions have improved since th
e financial crisis, there can be 
no assurance that significant di
sruption and volatility in the 
financial markets will not occur in
 the future. For example, in the 
summer of 2011 concerns regardin
g the potential failure to raise 
the U.S. government debt limit and the eventual downgrade of 
U.S. government debt ratings caused uncertainty and volatility in 

financial markets. Although the U.
S. debt limit was increased, a 
failure to raise the U.S. debt limi
t in the future and/or additional 
downgrades of the sovereign debt 
ratings of the U.S. government 
or the debt ratings of related institutions, agencies or 

instrumentalities, as well as other fiscal or political events could, 
in addition to causing economic and financial market 

disruptions, materially adversely affect the market value of the 
U.S. government securities that we
 hold, the availability of those 
securities as collateral for borrowing, and our ability to access 
capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other 
material adverse effects on the op
eration of our business and our 
financial results and condition. 
 As noted above, we rely heavily on bank deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other 

financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors 
raise the rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may 
increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing 

deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more 
expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce our 
net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and 

savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits 

may decrease when customers perc
eive alternative investments, 
such as the stock market, as 
providing a better risk/return 
tradeoff. When customers move mo
ney out of bank deposits and 
into other investments, we may los
e a relatively low cost source 
of funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting 

our liquidity. 
 If we are unable to continue
 to fund our assets through 
customer bank deposits or
 access capital markets on favorable 
terms or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or 
otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, 
net interest margin, financial results and condition may be 

materially adversely affected. As
 we did during the financial 
crisis, we may also need to
 raise
 additional capital through the 
issuance of common stock, which could dilute the ownership of 

existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common 

stock dividend to preserve capital 
or in order to raise additional 
capital.   
 For more information, refer to the ﬁRis
k Management Œ Asset/Liability Managementﬂ section in this Report. 
  Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a 
material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, 
financial results and condition.
 Our borrowing costs and 
ability to obtain funding are influenced by our credit ratings. 
Reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely 
affect our ability to borrow funds and raise the costs of our 
borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business 
counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other 
actions that could adversely affect
 our ability to raise capital. 
Credit ratings and credit ratings agencies™ outlooks 
are based on 
the ratings agencies™ analysis of many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, such as our capital adequacy, the level and 

quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, 
and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit 
ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other 
external factors, including market volatility and concerns or 

perceptions about the financial services industry generally. 
 On September 21, 2011, 
Moody™s downgraded the long
-term senior debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. one 
notch to A2 and Aa3, respectively, based on its determination 
that, as a result of the Dodd-Fra
nk Act, the U.S. government is 
less likely to support systemically important financial 
institutions, if needed, than duri
ng the financial crisis. The short-
term debt ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank were 

affirmed at Prime-
1. Moody™s also indicated that its outlook on 
the Parent™s and Wells Fargo Bank™s long
-term senior debt 
ratings is negative based on 
the possibility that Moody™s ma
y further reduce its assumptions abo
ut the likelihood of systemic 
support for systemically important financial institutions. On 

November 29, 2011, S&P lowered
 the long-term senior debt 
ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank one notch to A+ and 
AA-, respectively, following changes in S&P™s ratings criteria for 
the global banking industry. S&P also reduced the Parent™s short
-term debt rating one notch to A-
1, affirmed Wells Fargo Bank™s 
short-term debt rating at A-1+, and maintained a negative 
outlook on 
the Parent™s long
-term debt reflecting the outlook on 
the U.S. sovereign rating in 
light of the amount of U.S. 
government support incorporated into our ratings. On July 15, 
2011, Fitch Ratings affirmed both the Parent™s and Wells Fargo 
Bank™s long
-term senior debt ratings and short-term debt ratings 
at AA- and F1+, respectively, and maintained a stable watch on 
those ratings. On March 29, 2011, DBRS confirmed both the 
Parent™s and Wells Fargo Bank™s long
-term senior and short-
term debt ratings, including the 
stable trend. There can be no 
assurance that we will maintain 
our current credit ratings. 
 Although the availability and 
cost of funding are influenced 
by credit ratings, to date the Moody™s and S&P ratings 

downgrades described above have not adversely affected our 

ability to access the capital mar
kets or fund our operations. 
While to date we do not believ
e there has been any meaningful 
change in our borrowing costs spec
ifically relating to the ratings 
downgrades described above, th
ere can be no assurance that 
more severe credit ratings downgrades in the future would not 
materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing costs. 
 Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional 
collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect 
our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent 

features in certain of our deriva
tive contracts. The Moody™s and 
S&P ratings downgrades described above have not triggered, and 

additional one and two notch down
grades in those credit ratings 
would not be expected to trigge
r, a material increase in our 
collateral or funding obligations. However, in the event of a more 
severe credit rating downgrade of our long-term and short-term 
credit ratings, the increase in our collateral or funding 
obligations and the effect on our liquidity could be material. For 
information regarding additional collateral and funding 

obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the 
100  event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, see 
Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.
  We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for 
liquidity, and federal and state law can limit those 
dividends.
 Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding 
company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from its 
subsidiaries. It receives a significant portion of its funding and 
liquidity from dividends and other distributions from its 
subsidiaries. We generally use these dividends and distributions, 

among other things, to pay dividends on our common and 
preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal 
and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions 

that our bank and some of our 
nonbank subsidiaries, including 
our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to our parent holding 

company. Also, our right to particip
ate in a distribution of assets 
upon a subsidiary™s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the 
prior claims of the subsidiary™s creditors.

   RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL REGULATORY 
REFORM AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND 

REGULATIONS 

 Enacted legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-
Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or 

regulation, could require us to change certain of our 
business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, 
impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely 
affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position.
 Our parent company, our subsidiary banks and many 
of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those related to our retail 
brokerage and mutual fund busine
sses, are subject to significant 
regulation under state and federal 
laws in the U.S., as well as the 
applicable laws of the various ju
risdictions outside of the U.S. 
where we conduct business. 
These regulations protect 
depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, 
investors and the banking and fina
ncial system as a whole, not 
necessarily our stockholders. Economic, market and political 
conditions during the past few 
years have led to a significant 
amount of new legislation and regulation in the U.S. and abroad. 
These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and se
rvices that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire 
new businesses, reduce or limit 
our revenue in businesses or impose additional fees, assessments 
or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the 
financial services industry, and adversely affect our business 
operations or have other negative consequences. 
 For example, in 2009 several legislative and regulatory 
initiatives were adopted that affe
cted revenue in 2011 and will 
continue to affect our businesses and financial results, including 
FRB amendments to Regulation E, which affect the way we may 
charge overdraft fees, and the enactment of the Credit Card 
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the 

Card Act), which affects our ability to change interest rates and 
assess certain fees on card accounts. We also implemented policy 
changes to help customers limit overdraft and returned item 
fees. The continuing impact of these laws and regulations on our 
future revenue could vary materially due to a variety of factors, 

including changes in customer behavior, economic conditions 
and other potential offsetting factors. 
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Fra
nk Act, the most significant 
financial reform legislation since the 1930s, became law. The 
Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, (i) established the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk 

posed by financial firms and imposes additional and enhanced 
FRB regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, on 
certain large, interconnected bank holding companies such as 

Wells Fargo and systemically significant nonbanking firms 
intended to promote financial stability; (ii) creates a liquidation 
framework for the resolution of covered financial companies, the 
costs of which would be paid th
rough assessments on surviving 
covered financial companies; (iii) makes significant changes to 
the structure of bank and bank holding company regulation and 
activities in a variety of areas, including prohibiting proprietary 
trading and private fund investment
 activities, subject to certain 
exceptions; (iv) creates a new framework for the regulation of 
over-the-counter derivatives and new regulations for the 
securitization market and strengthens the regulatory oversight of 

securities and capital markets by the SEC; (v) established the 

Consumer Financial Protection Bu
reau (CFPB) within the FRB, 
which has sweeping powers to administer and enforce a new 

federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation; 

(vi) may limit the existing pre-emption of state laws with respect 
to the application of such laws 
to national banks, makes federal 
pre-emption no longer applicable to operating subsidiaries of 
national banks, and gives state authorities, under certain 
circumstances, the ability to enforce state laws and federal 

consumer regulations against national banks; (vii) provides for 
increased regulation of residential mortgage activities; (viii) 
revised the FDIC's assessment base for deposit insurance by 
changing from an assessment base
 defined by deposit liabilities 
to a risk-based system based on total assets; (ix) phases out over 

three years beginning January 2013
 the Tier 1 capital treatment 
of trust preferred securities; (x) permitted banks to pay interest 
on business checking accounts be
ginning on July 1, 2011; (xi) 
authorized the FRB under the 
Durbin Amendment to adopt 
regulations that limit debit card interchange fees received by 
debit card issuers; and (xii) includes several corporate 
governance and executive co
mpensation provisions and 
requirements, including mandating an advisory stockholder vote 
on executive compensation.  
The Dodd-Frank Act and many 
of its provisions became 
effective in July 2010 and July 2011. However, a number of its 

provisions still require extensive rulemaking, guidance, and 
interpretation by regulatory au
thorities. Accordingly, in many 
respects the ultimate impact 
of the Dodd-Frank Act and its 
effects on the U.S. financial sy
stem and the Company still remain 
uncertain. Nevertheless, the Dodd-Frank Act, including current 
and future rules implementing its provisions and the 
101Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 interpretation of those rules, could result in a loss of revenue, 
require us to change certain of our business practices, limit our 

ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our 
capital requirements and impose additional assessments and 
costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business 
operations and have other negative consequences. For example, 
as a result of the FRB™s new rules limiting debit card interchange 

fees, our fourth quarter 2011 debit card interchange fees were 
reduced by $365 million (pre-tax). Although we expect to 
recapture a portion of our lost in
come over time through volume 
and product changes, there can be 
no assurance that we will be 
successful in our efforts to miti
gate the negative impact to our 
financial results from the Durbin Amendment.  
In addition, our consumer businesses, including our 
mortgage, credit card and other consumer lending and non-

lending businesses, may be negatively
 affected by the activities of 
the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking powers and supervisory 
authority over consumer financial products and services. 
Although the full impact of 
the CFPB on our businesses is 
uncertain, the CFPB™s activities may increase our compliance 

costs and require changes in our business practices as a result of 

new regulations and requirements which could limit or 
negatively affect the products and 
services that we currently offer 
our customers. As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of our 

consumer businesses, we also may become subject to more or 
expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations, which 
also could result in increased costs and harm to our reputation in 

the event of a failure to comply with the increased regulatory 

requirements.   
 The Dodd-
Frank Act™s proposed proh
ibitions or limitations 
on proprietary trading and privat
e fund investment activities, 
known as the ﬁVolcker Rule,ﬂ also may reduce our revenue and 
earnings, although proprietary tr
ading has not been significant 
to our financial results. The Volcker Rule is subject to final 
rulemaking and interpretation, an
d the ultimate impact of the 
Volcker Rule on our investment activities, including our venture 
capital business, is uncertain.   
  Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly 
affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 

finance market in the United St
ates. These proposals, among 
other things, consider winding down the GSEs and reducing or 

eliminating over time the role 
of the GSEs in guaranteeing 
mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as 
the implementation of reforms re
lating to borrowers, lenders, 
and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the 
maximum size of a loan that the 
GSEs can guarantee, phasing in 
a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, 

improving underwriting standards,
 and increasing accountability 
and transparency in the securiti
zation process. As recently 
proposed by the Obama administration, Congress also may 

consider the adoption of legisl
ation to reform the mortgage 
financing market in an effort to assist borrowers experiencing 
difficulty in making mortgage payments or refinancing their 
mortgages. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the 
adoption of any legislation rega
rding the GSEs and/or the home 
mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company™s 

business and financial results, are uncertain. 
Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, also 
could significantly change our regulatory environment and 
increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services 
companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. 

 For more information, refer 
to the ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ 
section in this Rep
ort and the ﬁRegulation and Supervisionﬂ 
section in our 2011 Form 10-K. 
 Bank regulations, including Basel capital standards and 

FRB guidelines and rules, may require higher capital 

and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common 
stock dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest 
in our business or provide loans to our customers
. Federal banking regulators co
ntinually monitor the capital 
position of banks and bank holding companies. In December 

2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision finalized a set of 
international guidelines for determining regulatory capital 
known as Basel III. These guidel
ines are designed to address 
many of the weaknesses identified
 in the banking sector as 
contributing to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 by, among 

other things, increasing minimum capital requirements, 

increasing the quality of capital, increasing the risk coverage of 
the capital framework, and increasing standards for the 
supervisory review process and public disclosure. When fully 

phased in, the Basel III guidelines require bank holding 

companies to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 common equity 
to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%. The Basel Committee 
also proposed certain liquidity coverage and funding ratios. In 

June 2011, the Basel Committee proposed additional Tier 1 
common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically 
important banks ranging from 1.
0% to 3.5% depending on the 
bank™s systemic importance to 
be determined based on certain 
factors. This new capital surcharge, which would be phased in 

beginning in January 2016 and be
come fully effective on January 
1, 2019, would be in addition to the Basel III 7.0% Tier 1 common 

equity requirement proposed in December 2010. The Company 

has been identified as one of the initial 29 global systemically 
important banks that would be subject to the surcharge, but the 
surcharge amount has not yet 
been determined. The U.S. 
regulatory bodies are reviewing the final international standards, 
and the ultimate impact of the Basel III standards on our capital 

and liquidity will depend on such final rulemaking and 
regulatory interpretations of the rules as we, along with our 
regulatory authorities, apply the final rules during the 
implementation process.  

 As part of its obligation to 
impose enhanced capital and risk-
management standards on large financial firms pursuant to the 
Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB issued 
a final capital plan rule that 
became effective December 30, 2011. The final capital plan rule 
requires top-tier U.S. bank ho
lding companies, including the 
Company, to submit annual capital plans for review and to 
obtain regulatory approval befo
re making capital distributions. 
There can be no assurance that the FRB would respond favorably 

to the Company™s future capital plans
. The FRB also recently 
proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act that will impose 
102  enhanced prudential standards on large bank holding companies 
such as the Company, including enhanced capital, stress testing, 

and liquidity requirements. 
 The Basel standards and FRB regulatory capital and liquidity 
requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our 
capital, including common stock dividends and stock 
repurchases, and may require us to increase our capital and/or 

liquidity. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory 
capital, regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to 
liquidate assets or otherwise change our business and/or 

investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial 
results. Although not currently anticipated, the proposed Basel 
capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to 

raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common 
stock may dilute the ownershi
p of existing stockholders. 
For more information, refer to
 the ﬁCapital Managementﬂ and 
ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ
 sections in this Report and the ﬁRegulation 
and Supervisionﬂ section of our 2011 Form 10
-K.   FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions 

and our financial results and condition. 
The FRB regulates 
the supply of money in the United States. Its policies determine 

in large part our cost of funds 
for lending and investing and the 
return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which 
affect our net interest income and net interest margin. 
The FRB™s 
interest rate policies also can materially affect the value of 
financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. 

In addition, its policies can af
fect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they 
may fail to repay their loans. 
Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and can be hard 

to predict. As a result of the FRB™s concerns regarding, among 
other things, continued slow economic growth and a weak 
housing market, the FRB recently 
indicated that it intends to 
keep the target range for the federa
l funds rate near zero at least 
through late 2014. The FRB also may increase its purchases of 
U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities or take other 
actions in an effort to reduce or maintain low long-term interest 
rates. As noted above, a declining or low interest rate 

environment and a flattening yield curve which may result from 
the FRB™s actions could negatively affect our net interest income 
and net interest margin as it may result in us holding lower 

yielding loans and investment securities on our balance sheet.   
 RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT AND OUR MORTGAGE 

BUSINESS
  As one of the largest lend
ers in the U.S., increased 
credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions, could require us to increase our
 provision for credit losses and allowance for credit 
losses
 and could have a material adverse effect on our 
results of operations and financial condition.
 When we 
loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk, or the 

risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. As one of 
the largest lenders in the U.S., th
e credit performance of our loan 
portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition. 
As noted above, if the current economic environment were to 
deteriorate, more of our customers may have difficulty in 
repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a 

higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses. We 
reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a 
charge to earnings. The amount of 
this allowance is based on our 
assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 

(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for 

determining the amount of the al
lowance is critical to our 
financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective 

and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of 

economic or market conditions th
at might impair the ability of 
our borrowers to repay their lo
ans. We might increase the 
allowance because of changing 
economic conditions, including 
falling home prices and higher unemployment, or other factors. 
For example, changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory 
environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in 

the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses.  
Reflecting the continued improved credit performance in our 
loan portfolios, our provision expense was $3.4 billion and 
$2.0 billion less than net ch
arge-offs in 2011 and 2010, 
respectively, which had a positive effect on our earnings. Absent 
significant deterioration in th
e economy, we expect future 
allowance releases in 2012, although at more modest levels. 

While we believe that our allowance for credit losses was 

appropriate at December 31, 2011, 
there is no assurance that it 
will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if 

housing and employment conditio
ns worsen. In the event of 
significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be 

required to build reserves in future periods, which would reduce 
our earnings. 
For more 
information, refer to the ﬁRisk Management Œ
 Credit Risk Managementﬂ and ﬁCritical Accounting Policies Œ
 Allowance for Credit Lossesﬂ sections in this Report. 
  We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses 
to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, 

industry segment, borrower type, or location of the 
borrower or collateral.
 Our credit risk and credit losses can 
increase if our loans are concen
trated to borrowers engaged in 
the same or similar activities or
 to borrowers who as a group may 
be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 

market conditions. We experience
d the effect of
 concentration 
risk in 2009 and 2010 when we 
incurred greater than expected 
losses in our home equity loan portfolio due to a housing 
slowdown and greater than expected deterioration in residential 
real estate values in many marke
ts, including the Central Valley 
California market and several Southern California metropolitan 

statistical areas. As California is our largest banking state in 

terms of loans and deposits, co
ntinued deterioration in real 
estate values and underlying economic conditions in those 

markets or elsewhere in California could result in materially 

higher credit losses. As a result 
of the Wachovia merger, we have 
increased our exposure to California, as well as to Arizona and 
Florida, two states that have also suffered significant declines in 
home values, as well as significan
t declines in economic activity. 
Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and 

real estate values in these stat
es and generally across the country 
103Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 could result in materially higher credit losses, including for our 
home equity portfolio. 
The Wachovia merger also increased our CRE exposure, 
particularly in California and F
lorida, and we are currently the 
largest CRE lender in the U.S.
 A deterioration in economic 
conditions that negatively affe
cts the business performance of 
our CRE borrowers, including increases in interest rates and/or 
declines in commercial property values, could result in materially 
higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our 
financial results and condition.  
The European debt crisis, which 
has resulted in deteriorating 
economic conditions in Europe and ratings agency downgrades 

of the sovereign debt ratings of several European countries, has 

increased foreign credit risk. Although our foreign loan exposure 
represented only approximately 5% of our total consolidated 
outstanding loans and 3% of our total assets at 

December 31, 2011, continued European economic difficulties 
could indirectly have a material adverse effect on our credit 
performance and results of operat
ions and financial condition to 
the extent it negatively affects the U.S. economy and/or our 

borrowers who have foreign operations.

Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 

Report. 
 We may incur losses on loans, securities and other 

acquired assets of Wachovia that are materially greater 

than reflected in our fair value adjustments.
 We accounted for the Wachovia merger under the purchase method 

of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of 

Wachovia at fair value. All PCI loans acquired in the merger were 
recorded at fair value based 
on the present value of their 
expected cash flows. We estima
ted cash flows using internal 
credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models using 
assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We 

may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these 
loans. In addition, although 
the difference between the pre-
merger carrying value of the credit-impaired loans and their 
expected cash flows 
Œ the ﬁnonaccretable differenceﬂ Œ
 is 
available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to 

increase our allowance for credit losses and related provision 

expense because of subsequent addi
tional credit deterioration in 
these loans.

  Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from 
quarter to quarter, including as a result of changes in 
interest rates and the value of our MSRs and MHFS, 

and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming 
loans to reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to 
fund new mortgage loans.
 We were the largest mortgage 
originator and residential mortgage servicer in the U.S. as of 
December 31, 2011, and we earn revenue from fees we receive for 
originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. As 

a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a sizeable 
portfolio of MSRs. An MSR is the 
right to service a mortgage loan 
Œ collect principal, interest and escrow amounts 
Œ for a fee. We 
acquire MSRs when we keep the se
rvicing rights after we sell or 
securitize the loans we have originated or when we purchase the 

servicing rights to mortgage loans originated by other lenders. 
We initially measure and carry substantially all our residential 
MSRs using the fair value measur
ement method. Fair value is the 

present value of estimated future net servicing income, 
calculated based on a number of variables, including 
assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. 

Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and 
thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually 
more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them 

at a lower rate. As the likelihood
 of prepayment increases, the 
fair value of our MSRs can decrease. Each quarter we evaluate 

the fair value of our MSRs, and any decrease in fair value reduces 

earnings in the period in whic
h the decrease occurs. We also 
measure at fair value prime MHFS
 for which an active secondary 
market and readily available market 
prices exist. In addition, we 
measure at fair value certain other interests we hold related to 
residential loan sales and securitizations. Similar to other 

interest-bearing securities, the value of these MHFS and other 
interests may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. 
For example, if market interest rate
s increase relative to the yield 
on these MHFS and other interests, their fair value may fall. 
When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends 
to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations. 

Under the same conditions, revenu
e from our MSRs can increase 
through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage 
originations usually tend to increase and the value of our MSRs 
usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. 

Even though they can act as a ﬁn
atural hedge,ﬂ the hedge is not 
perfect, either in amount or ti
ming. For example, the negative 
effect on revenue from a decrease 
in the fair value of residential 
MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit 
from more originations and the 
MSRs relating to the new loans 
would generally accrue over time. It
 is also possible that, because 
of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing 

market similar to current market conditions, even if interest 

rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also 
fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough 
to offset the decrease in the 
MSRs value caused by the lower 
rates. 
We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We generally do not 

hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging 
any of the risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring 
sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a 

perfect science. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. 
Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly 
correlate with the value or inco
me being hedged. We could incur 

significant losses from our hedging activities. There may be 
periods where we elect not to
 use derivatives and other 
instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.  
We sell most of the mortgage loans we originate in order to 
reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans. 
We rely on GSEs to purchase loans that meet their conforming 

loan requirements and on other capital markets investors to 
104  purchase loans that do not meet those requirements 
Œ referred to 
as ﬁnonconformingﬂ loans. 
During the past few years 
investor 
demand for nonconforming loans has fallen sharply, increasing 
credit spreads and reducing the liquidity for those loans. In 
response to the reduced liquidit
y in the capital markets, we may 
retain more nonconforming loans.
 When we retain a loan not 
only do we keep the credit risk of the loan but we also do not 

receive any sale proceeds that 
could be used to generate new 
loans. Continued lack of liquidity could limit our ability to fund 
Œ and thus originate 
Œ new mortgage loans, reducing the fees we 
earn from originating and servicing loans. In addition, we cannot 
assure that GSEs will not materially limit their purchases of 
conforming loans, including beca
use of capital constraints, or 
change their criteria for confor
ming loans (e.g., maximum loan 
amount or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in 

conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing 

Agency acting as conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how 
the conservatorship will end, or
 any associated changes to the 
GSEs business structure and operations that could result. As 
noted above, there are various proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the U.S., including
 the role of the GSEs in the 

housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such 
regulatory reform regarding th
e housing finance market and the 
GSEs, including whether the GSEs wi
ll continue to exist in their 
current form, as well as any ef
fect on the Company™s business 
and financial results, are uncertain.

 We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or 
reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches 
in contractual representations and warranties.
 We sell 
residential mortgage loans to various parties, including GSEs, 

SPEs that issue private labe
l MBS, and other financial 
institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or 
private label securitization. We may also pool FHA-insured and 
VA-guaranteed mortgage loans which back securities guaranteed 

by GNMA. The agreements under which we sell mortgage loans 
and the insurance or guaranty ag
reements with the FHA and VA 
contain various representations and warranties regarding the 
origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans, including 

ownership of the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in 

the applicable agreement, validity 
of the lien securing the loan, 
absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing 
the loan, and compliance with ap
plicable origination laws. We 
may be required to repurchase 
mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor 
or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans in the event of a breach
 of contractual representations 
or warranties that is not remedied within a period (usually 
90 days or less) after we receiv
e notice of the 
breach. Contracts 
for mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of 
specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to 
inadequate responses to repurchase requests. Similarly, the 
agreements under which we sell mortgage loans require us to 

deliver various documents to the se
curitization trust or investor, 
and we may be obligated to repurchase any mortgage loan as to 
which the required documents are 
not delivered or are defective. 
We may negotiate global settlem
ents in order to resolve a 
pipeline of demands in lieu of repurchasing the loans. We 
establish a mortgage repurchase liability related to the various 
representations and warranties that reflect management™s 
estimate of losses for loans which we have a repurchase 

obligation. Our mortgage purchase liability represents 
management™s be
st estimate of the prob
able loss that we may 
expect to incur for the represen
tations and warranties in the 
contractual provisions of our sales of mortgage loans. Because 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon 
economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external 
conditions that may change over 
the life of the underlying loans, 
the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is 

difficult to estimate and requires considerable management 

judgment. As a result of the uncertainty in the various estimates 
underlying the mortgage repurchase
 liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability 
that are reasonably possible. 
The estimate of the range of 
possible loss for representations and warranties does not 
represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available 
information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions 
that are subject to change. If
 economic conditions and the 
housing market do not improve or future investor repurchase 
demand and our success at appealing repurchase requests differ 
from past experience, we could continue to have increased 

repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on 

repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase 
liability.

 We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, 

be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or 

reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage 
loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other 
sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, 

including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan 
foreclosure actions.
 We act as servicer and/or master servicer 
for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for 
unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer 

or master servicer for those loans we have certain contractual 

obligations to the securitization 
trusts, investors or other third 
parties, including, in our capacity as a servicer, foreclosing on 
defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the 
applicable securitization or
 other investor agreement, 
considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan 
modifications or short sales and, in our capacity as a master 
servicer, overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the 

servicer. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as 
servicer or master servicer, we may
 be subject to termination if 
the breach is not cured within a specified period of time 
following notice, which can generally be given by the 
securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security 
holders, causing us to lose serv
icing income. In addition, we may 
be required to indemnify the secu
ritization trustee against losses 
105Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 from any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, to 
perform our servicing obligations or any act or omission on our 

part that involves wilful misfeasance, bad faith or gross 
negligence. For certain investors and/or certain transactions, we 
may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or 
reimburse the investor for credit 
losses incurred on the loan as a 
remedy for servicing errors with 
respect to the loan. If we have 
increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did 

not satisfy our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, or 
increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a 

significant reduction to net servicing income within mortgage 
banking noninterest income. 
 We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-

execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity 
as a servicer in connection
 with pending or completed 
foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a 
foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to 
overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the 
foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or 
to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the 
required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities 

may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly 
to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In 
addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action 

are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect 
or repurchase the loan. We may incur liability to securitization 
investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of 

mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply 

with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our MSRs 
may be negatively affected to 
the extent our servicing costs 
increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject 
to fines and other sanctions imposed by Federal or state 
regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our 
foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other 
mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our 
reputation or negatively affect our residential mortgage 

origination or servicing business. In April 2011, we entered into 
consent orders with the OCC an
d the FRB following a joint 
interagency horizontal examination of foreclosure processing at 
large mortgage servicers, includ
ing the Company. These orders 
incorporate remedial requirements
 for identified deficiencies 
and require the Company to, among
 other things, take certain 
actions with respect to our mortgage servicing and foreclosure 
operations, including submitting various action plans to ensure 

that our mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations comply 
with legal requirements, regulatory guidance and the consent 
orders. As noted above, any increase in our servicing costs from 
changes in our foreclosure and other servicing practices, 

including resulting from the consent orders, negatively affects 
the fair value of our MSRs. 
 The consent orders did not provide for civil money 

penalties but both government entities reserved the ability to 
seek such penalties. On February 9, 2012, the OCC and the FRB 
announced that they had also im
posed civil money penalties of 
$83 million and $85 million, resp
ectively, related to the consent 
orders. These penalties will be 
satisfied through payments made 
under a separate simultaneous settlement in principle, 
announced on the same day, among the Department of Justice, a 
task force of Attorneys General from 49 states, other government 
entities, the Company and four other mortgage servicers related 

to mortgage servicing and fore
closure practices. Under the 
settlement in principle, which is subject to the execution of a 
definitive agreement and court ap
proval, the Company agreed to 
certain commitments totaling $5.3 billion involving, among 

other things, a commitment to provide $3.4 billion in aggregate 

consumer relief and assistance programs for qualified borrowers, 
including expanded first and second lien mortgage modifications 
that broaden the use of principa
l reduction to help customers 
achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that 
includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of arrearages 
for unemployed borrowers, cash-for-keys payments to borrowers 

who voluntarily vacate 
properties, and ﬁanti
-blightﬂ provisions 
designed to reduce the impact on communities of vacant 

properties, and an expanded 
first-lien refinance program 
commitment estimated to provide $900 million of aggregate 
payment relief to qualified borrowers over the life of the 
refinanced loans. In addition, the Company will be required to 
implement comprehensive servicin
g standards. As part of the 
settlement in principle, the Company was released from claims 
and allegations relating to servicing, modification and 
foreclosure practices; however, the settlement does not release 
the Company from any claims ar
ising out of securitization 
activities, including representations made to investors respecting 
mortgage-backed securities; criminal claims; repurchase 
demands from the GSEs; and inqu
iries into MERS, among other 
items. Government agencies continue investigations of whether 

the Company may have violated fair lending or other laws and 
regulations relating to mortgage origination practices and 
whether the Company™s offering statements included adequate 

disclosure of the risks associated with mortgage-backed 
securities. These investigations, as well as any investigations or 
liti
gation relating to any of the Company™s mortgage servicing 
and foreclosure practices that are 
not covered or released by the 
settlement in principle or definitive agreement, could result in 

material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other 
enforcement actions. 
The Company™s payment and other 
customer relief obligations under the settlement in principle 
were accrued for or otherwise considered in our allowance for 
credit losses and in the nonaccreta
ble difference relating to our 
purchased-credit-impaired residential mortgage portfolio as of 
December 31, 2011, and, therefor
e, are not expected to have a 
material adverse effect on our financial results. However, there 
can be no assurance 
that the settlement will not result in 
unexpected costs or developments that could materially 
adversely affect our mortgage business and/or our financial 
results. For example, we may be required to pay additional 

amounts under the settlement 
if we fail to satisfy our 
commitment requirements in a timely manner. Furthermore, 

there can be no assurance as to when or whether a definitive 

agreement regarding the settlement will be reached and finalized 
or that it will be on terms cons
istent with the settlement in 
principle.

 Financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage 
and bond insurers may negatively affect our servicing 
and investment portfolios. 
Our servicing portfolio includes 
certain mortgage loans that carry some level of insurance from 
one or more mortgage insurance 
companies. To the extent that 
any of these companies experience financial difficulties or credit 

downgrades, we may be required, as
 servicer of the insured loan 

on behalf of the investor, to ob
tain replacement coverage with 
another provider, possibly at a higher cost than the coverage we 

would replace. We may be resp
onsible for some or all of the 
incremental cost of the new cove
rage for certain loans depending 
on the terms of our servicing ag
reement with the investor and 
other circumstances, although we 
do not have an additional risk 
of repurchase loss associated with claim amounts for loans sold 
to third-party investors. Similar
ly, some of the mortgage loans 
we hold for investment or for sale carry mortgage insurance. If a 
mortgage insurer is unable to me
et its credit obligations with 
respect to an insured loan, we might incur higher credit losses if 
replacement coverage is not obta
ined. For example, in October 
2011, PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (PMI), one of our providers of 

mortgage insurance, was seized by its regulator. We previously 

utilized PMI to provide mortgage
 insurance on certain loans 
originated and held in our portfolio and on loans originated and 
sold to third-party investors. 
We also hold a small amount of 
residential MBS, which are backed by mortgages with a limited 

amount of insurance provided by
 PMI. PMI has announced that 
it will pay 50% of insurance clai
m amounts in cash with the rest 
deferred. Although we do not expect PMI™s situation to have a 

material adverse effect on our financial results because of the 
limited amount of loans and securities held in our portfolios with 
PMI insurance support, we canno
t be certain that any such 
future events involving one of our other mortgage insurance 
company providers will not materially adversely affect our 

mortgage business and/or fina
ncial results. We also have 
investments in municipal bonds th
at are guaranteed against loss 
by bond insurers. The value of 
these bonds and the payment of 
principal and interest on them may be negatively affected by 
financial difficulties or credit downgrades experienced by the 
bond insurers.

OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL RISK  
 A failure in or breach of our operational or security 

systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party 

vendors and other service providers, including as a 
result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, 
result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or 
proprietary information, damage our reputation, 
increase our costs and cause losses.
 As a large financial 
institution that serves over 70
 million customers through over 
9,000 stores, 12,000 ATMs, the Internet and other distribution 
channels across the U.S. and inte
rnationally, we depend on our 
ability to process, record and monitor a large number of 

customer transactions on a continuous basis. As our customer 
base and locations have expanded throughout the U.S. and 
internationally, and as customer, public and regulatory 
expectations regarding operational and information security 
have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must 

continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, 
disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, 
accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems 

and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or 
damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that 
are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there 

could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; 
electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such 
as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; 

events arising from local or larger scale political or social 
matters, including terrorist acts; 
and, as described below, cyber 
attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other 
safeguards in place, our busine
ss operations may be adversely 
affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical 
infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses 
and customers. 
 Information security risks for large financial institutions such 
as Wells Fargo have generally incr
eased in recent years in part 
because of the proliferation of 
new technologies, the use of the 
Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct 

financial transactions, and the 
increased sophistication and 
activities of organized crime, ha
ckers, terrorists, activists, and 
other external parties. Those parties also may attempt to 

fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our 

systems to disclose confidential
 information in order to gain 
access to our data or that of ou
r customers. As noted above, our 
operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and 
storage of confidential information in our computer systems and 
networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and 

capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, 
computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct 
their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, 

our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PC™s, and 
other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. 
Although we believe we have 
robust information security 
procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, 
and our customers™ devices may become the target of cyber 

attacks or information security br
eaches that could result in the 
unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or 
destruction of Wells Fargo™s or our customers™ confidential, 
proprietary and other informatio
n, or otherwise disrupt Wells 
Fargo™s or its customers™ or other third parties™ business 
operations. 
 Third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our 

business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, 
financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or 
security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of 
operational and information securi
ty risk to us, including from 
breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity 

constraints. 
107Risk Factors 
(continued) 
  Although to date we have no
t experienced any material losses 
relating to cyber attacks or othe
r information security breaches, 
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in 
the future. Our risk and exposu
re to these matters remains 
heightened because of, among ot
her things, the evolving nature 
of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and 
its role in the financial services 
industry, our plans to continue to 
implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel 
strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions 
to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our 

expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the 
outsourcing of some of our business operations, the continued 
uncertain global economic environment, and the remaining 

system and customer account conversions associated with our 
integration of Wachovia expected 
to be completed in first quarter 
2012. As a result, cybersecurit
y and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices 
designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and 
networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a 
priority for Wells Fargo. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we 
may be required to expend significant additional resources to 

continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to 
investigate and remediate any information security 
vulnerabilities. 

 Disruptions or failures in 
the physical infrastructure or 
operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or 

cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or 

devices that our customers use to access our products and 

services could result in customer attrition, financial losses, the 
inability of our customers to transact business with us, violations 
of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties 

or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other 
compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of 
which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
or financial condition. 
  Our framework for managing risks may not be effective 

in mitigating risk and loss to us.
 Our risk management 
framework seeks to mitigate ri
sk and loss to us. We have 
established processes and proced
ures intended to identify, 
measure, monitor, report and anal
yze the types of risk to which 
we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, 

interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 

reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have no
t appropriately anticipated or 
identified. For example, the recent financial and credit crisis and 
resulting regulatory reform high
lighted both the importance and 
some of the limitations of manag
ing unanticipated risks. If our 
risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer 

unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations 
or financial condition.
  We may incur fines, pena
lties and other negative 

consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even 
inadvertent or unintentional violations. 
We maintain 
systems and procedures designed to
 ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory 
frameworks provide for the impositi
on of fines or penalties for 
noncompliance even though the 
noncompliance was inadvertent 
or unintentional and even though 
there was in place at the time 
systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For 

example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial 

institutions from participating 
in the transfer of property 
belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and 

designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose 

penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if 
reasonable processes are in place 
to prevent the violations. There 
may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of 
noncompliance, including restrictio
ns on certain activities. Such 
a finding may also damage our reputation as described below 

and could restrict the ability of institutional investment 

managers to invest in our securities. 
 Negative publicity, including as a result of protests, 
could damage our reputation and business.
 Reputation risk, or the risk to our busine
ss, earnings and capital from 
negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and 

increased substantially because of
 the financial crisis and the 
increase in our size and profile in
 the financial services industry 
following our acquisition of Wachovia. The reputation of the 

financial services industry in 
general has been damaged as a 
result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the 
financial services industry, and negative public opinion about the 

financial services industry generally or Wells Fargo specifically 
could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers. 
Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged 

conduct in any number of activities, including mortgage lending 
practices, servicing and foreclosure activities, corporate 
governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, 
and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer 
information, and from actions taken by government regulators 

and community or other organiza
tions in response to that 
conduct. Because we conduct most of our businesses under the 

ﬁWells Fargoﬂ brand, negative public opinion about one business 

could affect our other businesses and also could negatively affect 
our ﬁcross
-sellﬂ strategy
. The proliferation of social media 
websites utilized by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well 
as the personal use of social media by our team members and 

others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also 

may increase the risk that 
negative, inappropriate or 
unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly 
that could harm our reputation or have other negative 
consequences, including as a result of our team members 

interacting with our customers 
in an unauthorized manner in 
various social media outlets. 

 During the past several months, Wells Fargo and other 

financial institutions have been th
e targets of numerous protests 
throughout the U.S., such as the 
ﬁOccupy Wall Streetﬂ protests 
and other movements designed to cause customers to close their 

accounts with large financial institutions. These protests have 
included disrupting the operation of our retail banking stores 
and have resulted in negative public commentary about financial 

institutions, including the fees 
charged for various products and 
108  services. There can be no assura
nce that continued protests and 
negative publicity for the Compan
y or large financial institutions 
generally will not harm our reputation and adversely affect our 
business and financial results.  
     Risks Relating to Legal Proceedings.
 Wells Fargo and some 
of its subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory and 

arbitration proceedings or inve
stigations concerning matters 
arising from our business activiti
es. Although we believe we have 
a meritorious defense in all material significant litigation 

pending against us, there can be no
 assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments 
associated with the claims become
 probable and the costs can be 

reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter 
even if we have not established a 
reserve. In addition, the actual 
cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than 
any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of 
a pending legal proceeding, depend
ing on the remedy sought and 
granted, could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition.  
For more information, refer to 
Note 15 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report.   

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY™S COMPETITIVE 

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT  
 We face significant and increasing competition in the 

rapidly evolving financial services industry. 
We compete 
with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry 
that is undergoing significant changes as a result of financial 
regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from 

the recent financial crisis and continued challenging economic 
conditions. Wells Fargo generally competes on the basis of the 
quality of our customer service, the wide variety of products and 
services that we can offer our cu
stomers and the ability of those 
products and services to satisfy our customers™ needs, the pricing 
of our products and services, the extensive distribution channels 
available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. 
Continued and increased competition in any one or all of these 

areas may negatively affect our market share and results of 
operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in 
our businesses in order to remain competitive. Given the current 

economic, regulatory, and political environment for large 

financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, as well as increased 

public protest movements and ne
gative publicity, there is 
increased competitive pressure to
 provide products and services 
at current or lower prices. Consequently, our ability to reposition 

or reprice our products and servic
es from time to time may be 
limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our 
competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their 
products and services. Any change
s in the types of products and 
services that we offer our custom
ers and/or the pricing for those 
products and services could result in a loss of customers and 
market share and could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations. 
 Continued technological advances and the growth of e-
commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions 

to offer products and services 
that traditionally were banking 
products, and for financial institutions and other companies to 
provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, 

including electronic payment solutions. We may not respond 
effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new 
competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our 
business to modify or adapt our existing products and services or 
develop new products and services to respond to our customers™ 

needs.  
 Our 
ﬁcross
-sellingﬂ efforts to increase the number 
of 
products our customers buy from us and offer them all 
of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key 
part of our growth strategy, and our failure to execute 

this strategy effectively could have a material adverse 
effect on our revenue growth and financial results. 
Selling more products to our customers 
Œ ﬁcross-sellingﬂ Œ
 is 
very important to our business model and key to our ability to 
grow revenue and earnings es
pecially during the current 
environment of slow economic growth and regulatory reform 
initiatives. Many of our competitors also focus on cross-selling, 
especially in retail banking and 
mortgage lending. This can limit 
our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us 
to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest 
income and revenue from our fee-based products. It could also 

affect our ability to keep existing customers. New technologies 
could require us to spend more to
 modify or adapt our products 
to attract and retain customers. 
Our cross-sell strategy also is 
dependent on earning more business from our Wachovia 
customers, and increasing our cross-sell ratio 
Œ or the average 
number of products sold to existing customers 
Œ may become 
more challenging and we might not attain our goal of selling an 

average of eight products to each customer. 
  Our ability to attract and retain qualified team 
members is critical to the success of our business and 
failure to do so could adversely affect our business 

performance, competitive position and future 
prospects.
 The success of Wells Fargo is heavily dependent on 
the talents and efforts of our 
team members, and in many areas 
of our business, including the commercial banking, brokerage, 

investment advisory, and capi
tal markets businesses, the 
competition for highly qualified pe
rsonnel is intense. In order to 
attract and retain highly qualified team members, we must 
provide competitive compensation. As a large financial 

institution we may be subject to 
limitations on compensation by 
our regulators that may adversely affect our ability to attract and 
retain these qualified team members. Some of our competitors 
may not be subject to these sa
me compensation limitations, 
which may further negatively affect our ability to attract and 
retain highly qualified team members.    
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 Changes in accounting policies or accounting 
standards, and changes in how accounting standards 
are interpreted or applied, could materially affect how 
we report our financial results and condition. 
Our accounting policies are fund
amental to determining and 
109Risk Factors 
(continued) 
 understanding our financial results and condition. As described 
below, some of these policies require use of estimates and 

assumptions that may affect the va
lue of our assets or liabilities 
and financial results. Any changes in our accounting policies 
could materially affect our financial statements. 
From time to time the FASB an
d the SEC change the financial 
accounting and reporting standard
s that govern 
the preparation 
of our external financial statements. In addition, accounting 
standard setters and those wh
o interpret the accounting 
standards (such as the FASB, SE
C, banking regulators and our 
outside auditors) may change or even reverse their previous 

interpretations or positions on how these standards should be 
applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards 

and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our 
control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how 
we report our financial results and condition. We may be 

required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply 
an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case 
resulting in our potentially restating prior period financial 
statements in material amounts. 
 Our financial statements are based in part on 

assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, could cause 
unexpected losses in the future, and our financial 

statements depend on our internal controls over 
financial reporting. 
Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required 
to use certain assumptions an
d estimates in preparing our 
financial statements, including in determining credit loss 
reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves related to 
litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, 
among other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical 

because they require management to make difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about matters that are inherently 
uncertain and because it is likely that materially different 
amounts would be reported under different conditions or using 
different assumptions. For a description of these policies, refer to 

the ﬁCritical Accounting Policiesﬂ section in this Report. If 
assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements 
are incorrect, we may experience material losses.  
Certain of our financial instrume
nts, including trading assets 
and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, 

private equity investments, structured notes and certain 

repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a 

determination of their fair value 
in order to prepare our financial 
statements. Where quoted market 
prices are not available, we 
may make fair value determinations based on internally 
developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some 
degree on management judgment. Some of these and other 

assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, 
making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on 
significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden 

illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and 
securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance 
sheet items, which may lead to
 the possibility that such 
valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and 
could lead to declines in our earnings. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company™s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 

and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal 

control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in 
our annual report on Form 10-
K, the existence of any ﬁmaterial 
weaknessesﬂ in our internal contr
ols. We cannot assure that we 
will not identify one or more mater
ial weaknesses as of the end of 
any given quarter or year, nor ca
n we predict the effect on our 
stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. Sarbanes-Oxley 
also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors 
may provide to us in order to pr
eserve their independence from 
us. I
f our auditors were found not to be ﬁindependentﬂ of us 
under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors 

and file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. We 

could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial 
statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to 
raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences.  

 RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS 
 Acquisitions could reduce our stock price upon 
announcement and reduce our earnings if we overpay 

or have difficulty integrating them. 
We regularly explore 
opportunities to acquire companies in the financial services 

industry. We cannot predict the fr
equency, size or timing of our 
acquisitions, and we typically do not comment publicly on a 
possible acquisition until we have 
signed a definitive agreement. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acqu
isition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price,
 and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 

common stock in connection wi
th the acquisition.   
We generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before 
we can acquire a bank, bank h
olding company or certain other 
financial services businesses depending on the size of the 
financial services business to be 
acquired. In deciding whether to 
approve a proposed acquisition, federal bank regulators will 

consider, among other factors, th
e effect of the acquisition on 
competition and the risk to the st
ability of the U.S. banking or 
financial system, our financial 
condition and future prospects 
including current and projected 
capital ratios and levels, the 
competence, experience, and integrity of management and 

record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience 

and needs of the communities to 
be served, including our record 
of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and our 
effectiveness in combating money laundering. As a result of the 
Dodd-Frank Act and concerns regarding the large size of 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, the regulatory process 
for approving acquisitions has become more complex and 

regulatory approvals may be more difficult to obtain. We cannot 
be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any 
required regulatory approvals will be granted. We might be 

required to sell banks, branches and/or business units or assets 
or issue additional equity as a co
ndition to receiving regulatory 
approval for an acquisition. In addition, federal bank regulations 
prohibit FRB regulatory approval of any transaction that would 
create an institution holding more
 than 10% of total U.S. insured 
deposits, or of any transaction (whether or not subject to FRB 
approval) that would create a financial company with more than 
110  10% of the liabilities of all financ
ial companies in the U.S. We are 
approaching the deposit cap,
 which may limit our bank 
acquisition opportunitie
s in the future.    
Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause us 
not to realize expected revenue in
creases, cost savings, increases 
in geographic or product presen
ce, and other projected benefits 
from the acquisition. The integrat
ion could result in higher than 
expected deposit attrition, loss of key team members, disruption 
of our business or the business 
of the acquired company, or 
otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and team 

members or achieve the anticipate
d benefits of the acquisition. 
Time and resources spent on integration may also impair our 

ability to grow our existing businesses. Also, the negative effect 

of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in 
acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than 
expected. Many of the foregoing 
risks may be increased if the 
acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic 
location where we do not already have significant business 
operations and/or team members.  
 *   *   * 
  Any factor described in this 
Report or in any of our other 
SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, 
adversely affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our 
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q 
filed with the SEC in 2012 for 
material changes to the above disc
ussion of risk factors. There 
are factors not discussed above or 
elsewhere in this Report that 
could adversely affect our fina
ncial results and condition. 
111  Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by SEC rules, the Company™s man
agement evaluated the effectiveness, as of
 December 31, 2011, of the Company™s dis
closure 
controls and procedures. The Company™s 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
participated in the eval
uation. Based on this 
evaluation, the Company™s chief executive officer and chief fina
ncial officer concluded that th
e Company™s disclosure control
s and 
procedures were effective 
as of December 31, 2011. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13
a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
 a process 
designed by, or under th
e supervision of, the Com
pany™s principal executive 
and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company™s Board, management and other perso
nnel, to provide reasonable assurance rega
rding the reliability of financial repor
ting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with U.S. genera
lly accepted accounting princip
les (GAAP) and includes those poli
cies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that 
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and dispositions
 of 
assets of the Company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transact
ions are recorded as necessa
ry to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts an
d expenditures of the Company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely dete
ction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company™s assets that could have a material effect o
n the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over fi
nancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projec
tions of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future pe
riods are subject to the risk
 that controls may become inadequate because of change
s in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance
 with the policies or procedures may dete
riorate. No change occurred during any qua
rter in 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, 
the Company™s internal control over financial reporting. 
Management™s report on internal control ov
er financial reporting is set forth below, 
and should be read with these limitation
s in mind. 
 Management™s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report
ing 
The Company™s management is responsible for establishing and maint
aining adequate internal control over financial reporting f
or the 
Company. Management assessed the effectiv
eness of the Company™s internal control over financial reporting as of December
 31, 2011, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsori
ng Organizations of the Trea
dway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control 
Œ Integrated Framework
. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31
, 2011, the Company™s in
ternal 
control over financial reporting was effective. 
  KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm th
at audited the Company™s financia
l statements included in this 
Annual Report, issued an audit report on 
the Company™s internal control over financial reporting. KPMG™s audit report appears o
n the 
following page. 
112  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Wells Fargo & Company: 
 We have audited Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries™ (th
e Company) internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control 
Œ Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company™s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting and for it
s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, incl
uded in the 
accompanying Management™s Report
 on Internal Control over Fi
nancial Reporting. Our responsibility
 is to express an opinion on the 
Company™s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether effective internal control ov
er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our 
audit included obtaining an unde
rstanding of internal control 
over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk th
at a material weakness exists, and testing an
d evaluating the design and operating ef
fectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also in
cluded performing such other proc
edures as we considered neces
sary in 
the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a proc
ess designed to provide reasonab
le assurance regarding the rel
iability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of fi
nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc
ounting 
principles. A company™s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those poli
cies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the tr
ansactions and dispositions of the asset
s of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance th
at transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statem
ents in 
accordance with generally accepted accounti
ng principles, and that receipts and expend
itures of the company are being made only
 in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
 the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
 or disposition of the company™
s assets that could have a mat
erial effect 
on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over fina
ncial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, p
rojections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
 the risk that controls may become inadequate because of cha
nges in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance wi
th the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects
, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
Œ Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with
 the standards of the Public Company Accoun
ting Oversight Board (United States), the 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2011
 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
changes in equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each
 of the years in the three-year
 period ended December 31, 20
11, 
and our report dated February 28, 2012, expressed an unqual
ified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

 Note 1: Summary of Signif
icant Accounting Policies 
 Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services 
company. We provide banking, insurance, trust and 

investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail 
banking, brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance 
through banking stores, the inte
rnet and other distribution 
channels to consumers, businesses and institutions in all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and in other countries. When we 
refer to ﬁWells
 Fargo,ﬂ ﬁthe Company,ﬂ ﬁw
e,ﬂ ﬁourﬂ or ﬁus,ﬂ we 
mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). 
Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding 
company and a bank holding comp
any. We also hold a majority 
interest in a real estate invest
ment trust, which has publicly 
traded preferred stock outstanding. 

 Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) and practices 
in the financial services indu
stry. To prepare the financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make 

estimates based on assumptions about future economic and 
market conditions (for example, unemployment, market 

liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the da
te of the financial statements and 
income and expenses during the reporting period and the related 
disclosures. Although our es
timates contemplate current 
conditions and how we expect them 
to change in the future, it is 
reasonably possible that actual co
nditions could be worse than 
anticipated in those estimates, 
which could materially affect our 
results of operations and financ
ial condition. Management has 
made significant estimates in several areas, including allowance 

for credit losses and purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans 
(Note 6), valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights 
(MSRs) (Notes 8 and 9) and fi
nancial instruments (Note 17), 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses (Note 9) and 
income taxes (Note 21). Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. 

  Accounting Standards Adopted in 2011 
In first quarter 2011, we ad
opted certain provisions of 
Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2010-6, 
Improving Disclosures abo
ut Fair Value Measurements
.   ASU 2010-06
 amends the disclosure requirements for fair 
value measurements. Companies are required to disclose 

significant transfers in and out of 
Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value  
hierarchy. This Update also clar
ifies that fair value measurement 
disclosures should be presented for each asset and liability class, 

which is generally a subset of a 
line item in the statement of 
financial position. In the roll
forward of Level 3 activity, 
companies must present information on purchases, sales, 
issuances, and settlements on a gross basis rather than on a net 
basis. Companies should also provide information about the 
valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for 
both recurring and nonrecurring in
struments classified as either 
Level 2 or Level 3. In first quarter 2011, we adopted the 
requirement for gross presentati
on in the Level 3 rollforward 
with prospective application. The remaining provisions were 

effective for us in first quarter 20
10. Our adoption of this Update 
did not affect our consolidated financial statement results since 

it amends only the disclosure requirements for fair value 

measurements. 
 
In third quarter 2011, we 
adopted the following new 
accounting guidance: 
 Certain provisions of ASU 2010-20, 
Disclosures about the 
Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance 

for Credit Losses
; and 
 ASU 2011-02, A Creditor™s Determination of Whether a 
Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring. 
  ASU 2010-20
 requires enhanced disclosures for the allowance 
for credit losses and financing receivables, which include certain 
loans and long-term accounts receivables. Companies are 
required to disaggregate credit quality information and roll 

forward the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment. 
Companies must also provide supplemental information on the 
nature and extent of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and 

their effect on the allowance fo
r credit losses. We adopted the 
new disclosure requirements for TD
Rs in third quarter 2011 with 
retrospective application to Ja
nuary 1, 2011. The remaining 
provisions were effective for us in fourth quarter 2010.
 Our adoption of this Update did not 
affect our consolidated financial 
statement results since it amends only the disclosure 
requirements for financing receivables and the allowance for 
credit losses. 
  
ASU 2011-02
 provides guidance cl
arifying under what 
circumstances a creditor should classify a restructured receivable 

as a TDR. A receivable is a TDR if both of the following exist: 1) a 

creditor has granted a concessi
on to the debtor, and 2) the 
debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. This Update clarifies 

that a creditor should consider all aspects of a restructuring 

when evaluating whether it has granted a concession, which 
include determining whether a debtor can obtain funds from 
another source at market rates and assessing the value of 

additional collateral and guarante
es obtained at the time of 
restructuring. This Update also provides factors a creditor 

should consider when determining if a debtor is experiencing 

financial difficulties, such as probability of payment default and 
bankruptcy declarations. This guidance was effective for us in 
third quarter 2011 with re
trospective application to 
January 1, 2011. Our adoption of
 this Update did not have a 
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In fourth quarter 2011, we early adopted ASU 2011-08, 
Testing Goodwill for Impairment
.  121Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 ASU 2011-08 
provides entities with the option to perform a 
qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment. If, 
based on qualitative reviews, a company concludes that more 
likely than not a reporting unit™s fair value is less than its 
carrying amount, then the compan
y must complete quantitative 
steps to determine if there is 
goodwill impairment. If a company 
concludes otherwise, quantitative tests are not required. Our 

adoption of this Update did not 
affect our consolidated financial 
statements. 

 
Accounting Standards with Retrospective Application 
The following accounting pronouncements have been issued by 
the FASB but are not yet effective: 

  Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2011-11, 

Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities; 
 ASU 2011-05, 
Presentation of Comprehensive Income; 
and 
 ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for 
Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of 
Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in 
Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05
.  ASU 2011-11 
expands the disclosure requirements for financial 

instruments and derivatives that may be offset in accordance 

with enforceable master netting agreements or similar 
arrangements. The disclosures are required regardless of 
whether the instruments have been offset (or netted) in the 

statement of financial position. Under ASU 2011-11, companies 

must describe the nature of offsetting arrangements and provide 
quantitative information about those agreements, including the 
gross and net amounts of financial instruments that are 

recognized in the statement of 
financial position. These changes 
are effective for us in first quarter 2013 with retrospective 

application. This Update will 
not affect our consolidated 
financial results since it amends only the disclosure 

requirements for offsetting financial instruments.
  ASU 2011-05
 eliminates the option for companies to include 
the components of other comprehe
nsive income in the statement 
of changes in stockholders™ equity.
 This Update requires entities 
to present the components of co
mprehensive income in either a 
single statement or in two separate statements, with the 
statement of other comprehensive income (OCI) immediately 

following the statement of income. This Update also requires 

companies to present amounts reclassified out of OCI and into 

net income on the face of the st
atement of income. In December 
2011, the FASB issued 
ASU 2011-12
, which defers indefinitely 
the requirement to present reclassification adjustments on the 

statement of income. The remaining provisions are effective for 
us in first quarter 2012 with retrospective application. Early 
adoption is permitted. This Update will not affect our 

consolidated financial results as it amends only the presentation 
of comprehensive income. 
 Consolidation 
Our consolidated financial statem
ents include the accounts of 
the Parent and our majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs 
(defined below) in which we are the primary beneficiary. 
Significant intercompany acco
unts and transactions are 
eliminated in consolidation. If we
 own at least 20% of an entity, 
we generally account for the investment using the equity 
method. If we own less than 20% 
of an entity, we generally carry 
the investment at cost, except marketable equity securities, 
which we carry at fair value with
 changes in fair value included 
in OCI. Investments accounted for under the equity or cost 
method are included in other assets. 
We are a variable interest holder in certain special-purpose 
entities (SPEs) in which equity investors do not have the 

characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the 
entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities 
without additional subordinated financial support from other 

parties (referred to as VIEs). Our variable interest arises from 
contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, 
which change with fluctuations in 
the fair value of the entity's 
assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary, 
defined as the party th
at that has both the 
power to direct the 
activities that most significantl
y impact the VIE and a variable 
interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. A 
variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other interest 

that changes with changes in th
e fair value of the VIE™s net 
assets. To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold 

could potentially be significant 
to the VIE, we consider both 
qualitative and quantitative fact
ors regarding the nature, size 
and form of our involvement with
 the VIE. We assess whether or 
not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an on-going basis. 
 Cash and Due From Banks 
Cash and cash equivalents include
 cash on hand, cash items in 
transit, and amounts due from the Federal Reserve Bank and 
other depository institutions.  
 Trading Assets 
Trading assets are primarily secu
rities, including corporate debt, 
U.S. government agency obligations and other securities that we 
acquire for short-term appreciation or other trading purposes, 
and the fair value of derivatives held for customer 
accommodation purposes or risk mitigation and hedging. 

Interest-only strips and other retained interests in 
securitizations that can be cont
ractually prepaid or otherwise 
settled in a way that the holder
 would not recover substantially 
all of its recorded investment are classified as trading assets. 

Trading assets are carried at fair value, with realized and 

unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income.  
 Securities 
SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE
  Debt securities that we might 
not hold until maturity and marketable equity securities are 

classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair 
value. Unrealized gains and losses, after applicable taxes, are 

reported in cumulative OCI. Fair value measurement is based 
upon quoted prices in active ma
rkets, if available. If quoted 
prices in active markets are no
t available, fair values are 
measured using independent pr
icing models or other model-

based valuation techniques such 
as the present value of future 
cash flows, adjusted for the secu
rity's credit rating, prepayment 
assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions 
122  and market liquidity. See Note 17
 for more information on fair 
value measurement of our securities. 
 We conduct OTTI analysis on a quarterly basis or more often 
if a potential loss-triggering even
t occurs. The initial indicator of 
OTTI for both debt and equity securities is a decline in market 
value below the amount recorded for an investment and the 
severity and duration of the decline. 

 For a debt security for which 
there has been a decline in the 
fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI if we 

(1) have the intent to 
sell the security, (2) it is more likely than 
not that we will be required to se
ll the security before recovery of 
its amortized cost basis, or (3) we do not expect to recover the 

entire amortized cost basis of the security. 

 Estimating recovery of the am
ortized cost basis of a debt 
security is based upon an assess
ment of the cash flows expected 
to be collected. If the cash flows 
expected to be collected are less 
than amortized cost, OTTI is considered to have occurred. In 
performing an assessment of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, we consider all re
levant information including: 
 the length of time and the exte
nt to which the fair value has 
been less than the amortized cost basis; 
 the historical and implied volati
lity of the fair value of the 
security; 
 the cause of the price decline, such as the general level of 

interest rates or adverse conditions specifically related to 
the security, an industry or a geographic area; 
 the issuer's financial condition, near-term prospects and 
ability to service the debt; 
 the payment structure of th
e debt security and the 
likelihood of the issuer bein
g able to make payments that 
increase in the future; 
 for asset-backed securities, the credit performance of the 
underlying collateral, including delinquency rates, level of 
non-performing assets, cumulative losses to date, collateral 
value and the remaining credit enhancement compared with 
expected credit losses;  
 any change in rating agencies' credit ratings at evaluation 
date from acquisition date and any likely imminent action;  
 independent analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit 
ratings and other independent market data; and  
 recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to 

the balance sheet date. 
  If we intend to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not 

we will be required to sell the 
security before recovery, an OTTI 
write-down is recognized in 
earnings equal to the entire 
difference between the amortized co
st basis and fair value of the 
security. For debt securities that are considered other-than-
temporarily impaired that we do not intend to sell or it is more 
likely than not that we will not be required to sell before 
recovery, the OTTI write-down is separated into an amount 

representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and 
the amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in 
OCI. The measurement of the credit loss component is equal to 
the difference between the debt 
security's cost basis and the 
present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the 

security's effective yield. The remaining difference between the 

security™s fair value and the present value of future expected cash 
flows is due to factors 
that are not credit-rel
ated and, therefore, 
are recognized in OCI. We believe that we will fully collect the 
carrying value of securities on which we have recorded a non-
credit-related impairment in OCI. 
 We hold investments in perpetual preferred securities (PPS) 
that are structured in equi
ty form, but have many of the 
characteristics of debt instruments, including periodic cash flows 
in the form of dividends, call fe
atures, ratings that
 are similar to 
debt securities and pricing li
ke long-term callable bonds. 
 Because of the hybrid nature of
 these securities, we evaluate 
PPS for OTTI using a model simila
r to the model we use for debt 
securities as described above. Am
ong the factors we consider in 
our evaluation of PPS are whether there is any evidence of 
deterioration in the credit of the 
issuer as indicated by a decline 
in cash flows or a rating agency downgrade to below investment 

grade and the estimated recovery period. Additionally, in 

determining if there was evidence
 of credit deterioration, we 
evaluate: (1) the severity of de
cline in market value below cost, 
(2) the period of time for whic
h the decline in fair value has 
existed, and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects 

of the issuer, including any spec
ific events which may influence 
the operations of the issuer. We consider PPS to be other-than-
temporarily impaired if cash flow
s expected to be collected are 
insufficient to recover our investment or if we no longer believe 

the security will recover within the estimated recovery period. 
OTTI write-downs of PPS are recognized in earnings equal to the 
difference between the cost basis 
and fair value of the security. 
Based upon the factors considered in our OTTI evaluation, we 

believe our investments in PPS currently rated investment grade 
will be fully realized and, accord
ingly, have not recognized OTTI 
on such securities.  
 For marketable equity securities other than PPS, OTTI 
evaluations focus on whether evidence exists that supports 
recovery of the unrealized loss within a timeframe consistent 
with temporary impairment. Th
is evaluation considers the 
severity of and length of time fair value is below cost, our intent 
and ability to hold the security until forecasted recovery of the 
fair value of the security, and the investee's financial condition, 
capital strength, and near-term prospects. 

 The securities portfolio is
 an integral part of our 
asset/liability management process. We manage these 

investments to provide liquidity, manage interest rate risk and 

maximize portfolio yield within capital risk limits approved by 

management and the Board of Directors and monitored by the 

Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee (Corporate 

ALCO). We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of 
these securities in noninterest income using the specific 
identification method. 

 Unamortized premiums and di
scounts are recognized in 
interest income over the contractual life of the security using the 

interest method. As principal 
repayments are received on 
securities (i.e., primarily mortgage-backed securities (MBS)) a 
proportionate amount of the rela
ted premium or discount is 
recognized in income so that th
e effective interest rate on the 
remaining portion of the secu
rity continues unchanged. 
  123Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 NONMARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES
  Nonmarketable equity 
securities include venture capita
l equity securities that are not 
publicly traded and securities acquired for various purposes, 
such as to meet regulatory requirements (for example, Federal 
Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock). 
These securities are accounted for under the cost or equity 
method and are included in other 
assets. We review those assets 
accounted for under the cost or equity method at least quarterly 
for possible OTTI. Our review typically includes an analysis of 
the facts and circumstances of ea
ch investment, the expectations 
for the investment's cash flows an
d capital needs, the viability of 
its business model and our exit strategy. We reduce the asset 

value when we consider declines in value to be other than 

temporary. We recognize the estimated loss as a loss from equity 
investments in noninterest income. In addition, we invest in 
certain equity securities held by our subsidiaries that meet the 

definition of an investment company (principal investments) 
and, therefore, are recorded at fair value with realized and 
unrealized gains and losses included in gains and losses from 
equity investments in noninterest income. 
 
Securities Purchased and Sold Agreements 
Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold 
under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized 

financing transactions and are reco
rded at the acquisition or sale 
price plus accrued interest. It is our policy to take possession of 

securities purchased under resale agreements, which are 

primarily U.S. Government and Government agency securities. 

We monitor the market value of securities purchased and sold, 
and obtain collateral from or return it to counterparties when 
appropriate. These financing transa
ctions do not create material 
credit risk given the collateral provided and the related 
monitoring process. 
 Mortgages Held for Sale 
Mortgages held for sale (MHF
S) include commercial and 
residential mortgages originated for sale and securitization in 
the secondary market, which is ou
r principal market, or for sale 
as whole loans. We elec
t the fair value option for substantially all 
residential MHFS (see Note 17). The remaining residential 

MHFS are held at the lower of cost or market value (LOCOM), 
and are valued on an aggregate portfolio basis. Commercial 

MHFS are held at LOCOM and are 
valued on an individual loan 
basis. 
 Gains and losses on MHFS are recorded in mortgage banking 
noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees for 
MHFS under fair value option are recognized in mortgage 
banking noninterest income at or
igination. For MHFS recorded 
at LOCOM, loan costs and fees 
are deferred at origination and 
are recognized in mortgage bank
ing noninterest income at time 
of sale. Interest income on MHFS for which the fair value option 

is elected is calculated based up
on the note rate of the loan and 
is recorded to interest income. 
 Our lines of business are authorized to originate held-for-
investment loans that meet or exceed established loan product 
profitability criteria, including minimum positive net interest 
margin spreads in excess of funding costs. When a 

determination is made at the ti
me of commitment to originate 
loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold these loans 
to maturity or for the ﬁforeseeab
le future,ﬂ subject to periodic 
review under our corporate asset/liability management process. 
In determining the ﬁforeseeab
le futureﬂ for these loans, 
management considers (1) the current economic environment 
and market conditions, (2) our business strategy and current 
business plans, (3) the nature an
d type of the loan receivable, 
including its expected life, and (4) our current financial 
condition and liquidity demands. Consistent with our core 
banking business of managing th
e spread between the yield on 
our assets and the cost of our funds, loans are periodically 
reevaluated to determine if our minimum net interest margin 
spreads continue to meet our profitability objectives. If 

subsequent changes in interest rates significantly impact the 
ongoing profitability of certain loan products, we may 
subsequently change our intent 
to hold these loans, and we 
would take actions to sell such loans in response to the 
Corporate ALCO directives to 
reposition our balance sheet 
because of the changes in interest 
rates. These directives identify 
both the type of loans to be sold and the weighted average 
coupon rate of such loans no longer meeting our ongoing 

investment criteria. Upon the is
suance of such directives, we 
immediately transfer these loans to the MHFS portfolio at 

LOCOM.  Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale (LHFS) are carried at LOCOM or at fair 

value. Generally, consumer loan
s are valued on an aggregate 
portfolio basis, and commercial loans are valued on an 
individual loan basis. Gains and losses on LHFS are recorded in 
other noninterest income. For LHFS recorded at LOCOM, direct 
loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination and 
are recognized in other noninterest income at time of sale. For 
loans recorded at fair value, direct loan origination costs and fees 
are recorded in other noninterest income at origination. The fair 
value of LHFS is based on what
 secondary markets are currently 
offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, and related 
gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income. 
 Loans 

Loans are reported at their outsta
nding principal balances net of 
any unearned income, cumulati
ve charge-offs, unamortized 
deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized 

premiums or discounts on purchased loans. PCI loans are 

reported net of any remaining purchase accounting adjustments. 
See the ﬁPurchased Credit
-Impaired Loansﬂ section in this Note 
for our accounting policy for PCI loans. 

 Unearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts and 

premiums are amortized to interest income over the contractual 
life of the loan using the interest method. Loan commitment fees 
are generally deferred and amortized into noninterest income on 

a straight-line basis over the commitment period. 
Loans also include direct financin
g leases that are recorded at 
the aggregate of minimum lease 
payments receivable plus the 
estimated residual value of the 
leased property, less unearned 
income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of direct financing 

leases, are recorded net of related nonrecourse debt. Leasing 
124  income is recognized as a cons
tant percentage of outstanding 
lease financing balances over the 
lease terms in interest income. 
 NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS
  We generally place loans 
on nonaccrual status when:  
 the full and timely collection of interest or principal 
becomes uncertain;  
 they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 
family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest 
or principal, unless both well
-secured and in the process of 
collection; or  
 part of the principal balance has been charged off and no 

restructuring has occurred.  
 PCI loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using 

an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly, 

such loans are no longer classi
fied as nonaccrual even though 
they may be contractually past due because we expect to fully 
collect the new carrying values of such loans (that is, the new 
cost basis arising out of purchase accounting). 
 When we place a loan on no
naccrual status, we reverse the 
accrued unpaid interest receivab
le against interest income and 
amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. A loan will 

remain in accruing status provided it is both well-secured and in 
the process of collection. If the ul
timate collectability of a loan is 
in doubt and the loan is on nonaccr
ual, the cost recovery method 
is used and cash collected is appl
ied to first reduce the principal 
outstanding. Generally, we return 
a loan to accrual status when 
all delinquent interest and prin
cipal become current under the 
terms of the loan agreement and collectability of remaining 

principal and interest is no longer doubtful.  

 For modified loans, we underwrite at the time of a 
restructuring to determine if th
ere is sufficient evidence of 
sustained repayment capacity ba
sed on the borrower™s financial 
strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios 
and other factors. If the 
borrower has demonstrated 
performance under the previous terms and the underwriting 
process shows the capacity to 
continue to perform under the 
restructured terms, the loan will remain in accruing status. 

When a loan classified as a TDR performs in accordance with its 

modified terms, the loan either continues to accrue interest (for 
performing loans) or will return to accrual status after the 

borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance 
(generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, 
inclusive of consecutive pa
yments made prior to the 
modification). Loans will be plac
ed on nonaccrual status and a 
corresponding charge-off is recorded if we believe it is probable 
that principal and interest cont
ractually due under the modified 
terms of the agreement will not be collectible. 
 Generally, consumer loans not secured by real estate or autos 
are placed on nonaccrual status on
ly when part of the principal 
has been charged off. Loans are fully charged off or charged 
down to net realizable value (fair value of collateral less 
estimated costs to sell) when 
deemed uncollectible due to 
bankruptcy or other factors, or when they reach a defined 

number of days past due based on loan product, industry 
practice, country, terms and other factors. 
 Our loans are considered past due when contractually 

required principal or interest 
payments have not been made on 
the due dates.  
 LOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES
  For commercial loans, we 
generally fully charge off or charge down to net realizable value 
for loans secured by collateral when: 
  management judges the loan to be uncollectible; 
 repayment is deemed to be pr
otracted beyond reasonable 
time frames; 
 the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal 
loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; 
 the customer has filed bank
ruptcy and the loss becomes 
evident owing to a lack of assets; or 
 the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and 
in the process of collection.  
For consumer loans, our charge-off policies are as follows:  
 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages 
Œ We generally 
charge down to net realizable value when the loan is 180 
days past due. 
 Auto loans 
Œ We generally fully charge off when the loan is 
120 days past due. 
 Credit card loans 
Œ We generally fully charge off when the 
loan is 180 days past due. 
 Unsecured loans (closed end) 
Œ We generally charge off 
when the loan is 120 days past due. 
 Unsecured loans (open end) 
Œ We generally charge off when 
the loan is 180 days past due. 
 Other secured loans 
Œ We generally fully or partially charge 
down to net realizable value wh
en the loan is 120 days past 
due. 
 IMPAIRED LOANS
  We consider a loan to be impaired when, 
based on current information and 
events, we determine that we 
will not be able to collect all am
ounts due according to the loan 
contract, including scheduled interest payments. This evaluation 
is generally based on delinquenc
y information, an assessment of 
the borrower™s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 

if any. Our impaired loans pr
edominantly include loans on 
nonaccrual status for commercial and industrial, commercial 
real estate (CRE), foreign loans and any loans modified in a 

TDR, on both accrual and nonaccrual status. 
When we identify a loan as
 impaired, we measure the 
impairment based on the present 
value of expected future cash 
flows, discounted at the loan™s
 effective interest rate. When 
collateral is the sole source of repayment for the loan, we may 
measure impairment base
d on the fair value of the collateral. If 
foreclosure is probable, we use 
the current fair value of the 
collateral less estimated selling costs, instead of discounted cash 
flows. 
If we determine that the value of
 an impaired loan is less than 
the recorded investment in the lo
an (net of previous charge-offs, 
deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or 
discount), we recognize impairment. When the value of an 
impaired loan is calculated by discounting expected cash flows, 
interest income is recognized using the loan™s effective interest 
rate over the remaining life of the loan. 
 125Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)
  In situations where, 
for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower™s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession
 for other than an insignificant 
period of time to the borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. We strive to 
identify borrowers in financial 
difficulty early and work with 
them to modify their loan to more affordable terms before it 
reaches nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include 
rate reductions, principal forgiv
eness, term extensions, payment 
forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our 
economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the 
collateral. For modifications where we forgive principal, the 
entire amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately 

charged off. Loans classified as TDRs, including loans in trial 
payment periods (trial modificati
ons), are considered impaired 
loans.   
 PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS
  Loans acquired 
with evidence of credit deterior
ation since their origination and 
where it is probable that we 
will not collect all contractually 
required principal and interest 
payments are accounted for using 
the measurement provision for PCI 
loans. PCI loans are recorded 
at fair value at the date of 
acquisition, and the historical 
allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried 

over. Some loans that otherwise 
meet the definition as credit-
impaired are specifically excluded from the PCI loan portfolios, 

such as revolving loans where the borrower still has revolving 

privileges. 

 Evidence of credit quality de
terioration as of the purchase 
date may include statistics su
ch as past due and nonaccrual 
status, commercial risk ratings, recent borrower credit scores 

and recent loan-to-value percenta
ges. Generally, acquired loans 
that meet our definition for nona
ccrual status are 
considered to 
be credit-impaired.  Substantially all commercial and industrial, CRE and foreign 
PCI loans are accounted for as individual loans. Conversely, 

Pick-a-Pay and other consumer PCI loans have been aggregated 
into several pools based on common risk characteristics. Each 
pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite 

interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. 
 Accounting for PCI loans involves estimating fair value, at 
acquisition, using the principal and interest cash flows expected 

to be collected discounted at 
the prevailing market rate of 
interest. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over 
the carrying value (estimated fair value at acquisition date) is 
referred to as the accretable yiel
d and is recognized in interest 
income using an effective yield me
thod over the remaining life of 
the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a 

reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash 
flows to be collected. The difference between contractually 
required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at 

acquisition, considering the impact
 of prepayments, is referred 
to as the nonaccret
able difference. 
 Subsequent to acquisition, we regularly evaluate our 

estimates of cash flows expected
 to be collected. If we have
 probable decreases in cash flows expected to be collected (other 
than due to decreases in intere
st rate indices and changes in 
prepayment assumptions), we charge the provision for credit 
losses, resulting in an increase to
 the allowance for loan losses. If 
we have probable and signific
ant increases in cash flows 
expected to be collected, we
 first reverse any previously 
established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest 

income as a prospective yield adju
stment over the remaining life 
of the loan, or pool of loans.
 Estimates of cash flows are 
impacted by changes in interest 
rate indices for variable rate 
loans and prepayment assumptions,
 both of which are treated as 
prospective yield adjustments included in interest income. 

 Resolutions of loans may include sales of loans to third 

parties, receipt of payments in settlement with the borrower, or 
foreclosure of the collateral. Fo
r individual PCI loans, gains or 
losses on sales to third partie
s are included in noninterest 
income, and gains or losses as a result of a settlement with the 

borrower are included in interest income. Our policy is to 
remove an individual loan from a pool based on comparing the 

amount received from its resolution with its contractual amount. 
Any difference between these amounts is absorbed by the 
nonaccretable difference for th
e entire pool. This removal 
method assumes that the amoun
t received from resolution 
approximates pool performance expectations. The remaining 

accretable yield balance is unaffe
cted and any material change in 
remaining effective yield caused by this removal method is 

addressed by our quarterly cash flow evaluation process for each 

pool. For loans that are resolved 
by payment in full, there is no 
release of the nonaccretable diffe
rence for the pool because there 
is no difference between the amount received at resolution and 

the contractual amount of the lo
an. Modified PCI loans are not 

removed from a pool even if those loans would otherwise be 
deemed TDRs. Modified PCI lo
ans that are accounted for 
individually are considered TDRs, and removed from PCI 
accounting if there has been a concession granted in excess of 
the original nonaccretable differ
ence. We include these TDRs in 
our impaired loans. 
 FORECLOSED ASSETS
  Foreclosed assets obtained through our 
lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans 

have been written down to thei
r net realizable value prior to 
foreclosure. Any further reduction 
to their net realizable value is 
recorded with a charge to the allowance for credit losses at 

foreclosure. We allow up to 90 days after foreclosure to finalize 
determination of net realizable va
lue. Thereafter, changes in net 
realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net 
realizable value of these asse
ts is reviewed and updated 
periodically depending on the type of property. 
 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
  The allowance for credit 
losses (allowance), which consists of the allowance for loan 
losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is 
management™s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan 
portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet 

date, excluding loans carried at fair value. It considers both 
unimpaired and impaired loans and is developed and 
documented at the loan portfolio segment level 
Œ commercial 
and consumer.  
Unimpaired loans are generally evaluated on a collective 
basis by utilizing risk grades for the commercial loan portfolio 
segment and loss estimates for pools of loans with similar risk 
126  characteristics for the consumer loan portfolio segment. 
Impaired loans are evaluated on
 an individual loan basis and 
predominantly include loans on nonaccrual status for 
commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, foreign loans 
and any loans modified in a TDR, on both accrual and 
nonaccrual status. Commercial 
and consumer PCI loans may 
require an allowance subsequent
 to their acquisition due to 
probable decreases in expected pr
incipal and interest cash flows 
(other than due to decreases in interest rate indices and changes 
in prepayment assumptions).  
 The allowance for each portfolio segment includes an 
amount for imprecision or uncert
ainty that may change from 
period to period. This imprecision amount represents 

management™s judgment of risks
 inherent in the evaluation 
processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. 
While our methodology attributes 
portions of the allowance to 
the specific portfolio segments, th
e entire allowance is available 
to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio and 

unfunded credit commitments. No single statistic or 
measurement determines the ad
equacy of the allowance for 
credit losses. 
 Securitizations and Beneficial Interests 
In certain asset securitization transactions that meet the 

applicable criteria to be accounte
d for as a sale, assets are sold to 
an entity referred to as an SPE, which then issues beneficial 

interests in the form of senior and subordinated interests 

collateralized by the assets. In some cases, we may retain 

beneficial interests issued by th
e entity. Additionally, from time 
to time, we may also re-secur
itize certain assets in a new 
securitization transaction. 

 The assets and liabilities transferred to an SPE are excluded 
from our consolidated balance sheet 
if the transfer qualifies as a 
sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. 
 For transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we 
recognize and initially measure at 
fair value all assets obtained 
(including beneficial interests) and liabilities incurred. We 
record a gain or loss in noninterest income for the difference 
between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 

sold. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, quoted 
market prices for similar assets
, or if market prices are not 
available, then the fair value is
 estimated using discounted cash 
flow analyses with assumptions for credit losses, prepayments 

and discount rates that are corroborated by and independently 

verified against market observable data, where possible. 
Retained interests from securitizations with off-balance sheet 
entities, including SPEs and VIEs where we are not the primary 
beneficiary, are classified as available for sale securities, trading 

account assets or loans, and 
are accounted for as described 
herein. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) 
We recognize the rights to servic
e mortgage loans for others, or 
MSRs, as assets whether we pu
rchase the MSRs or the MSRs 
result from a sale or securitization of loans we originate (asset 

transfers). We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. 
Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at either fair 

value or LOCOM based on our strategy for managing interest 
rate risk. Currently, substantially all of our residential loan 
MSRs are carried at fair value. All of our MSRs related to our 

commercial mortgage loans are subsequently measured at 
LOCOM. We base the fair value of MSRs on the present value of 
estimated future net servicing inco
me cash flows. We estimate 
future net servicing income cash
 flows with assumptions that
 market participants would use to estimate fair value, including 
estimates of prepayment speeds (including housing price 
volatility), discount rates, default rates, cost to service (including 

delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, 
contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. 
Our valuation approach is independently validated by our 

internal valuation model validation group and our valuation 
estimates are periodically 
benchmarked to independent 
appraisals.  
 Changes in the fair value of MSRs occur primarily due to the 
collection/realization of expected cash flows, as well as changes 
in valuation inputs and assumptions. For MSRs carried at fair 
value, changes in fair value are re
ported in noninterest income in 
the period in which the change
 occurs. MSRs subsequently 
measured at LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over 

the period of, estimated net se
rvicing income. The amortization 
of MSRs is reported in noninterest income, analyzed monthly 
and adjusted to reflect changes in
 prepayment speeds, as well as 
other factors. 

 MSRs accounted for at LOCOM 
are periodically evaluated for 
impairment based on the fair valu
e of those assets. For purposes 
of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs 
based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying 
loans, including investor and product type. If, by individual 

stratum, the carrying amount of th
ese MSRs exceeds fair value, a 
valuation reserve is established. The valuation reserve is 

adjusted as the fair value changes. 
 Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated 

depreciation and amortization. Capital leases, where we are the 

lessee, are included in premises 
and equipment at the capitalized 
amount less accumulated amortization. 

 We primarily use the straight-line method of depreciation 

and amortization. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for 
buildings, up to 10 years for 
furniture and equipment, and the 
shorter of the estimated useful li
fe or lease term for leasehold 
improvements. We amortize capitalized leased assets on a 

straight-line basis over the lives of the respective leases. 
 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill is recorded in business combinations under the 

purchase method of accounting when the purchase price is 
higher than the fair value of ne
t assets, including identifiable 
intangible assets. 
 We assess goodwill for impairment annually, and more 
frequently in certain circumstances. We initially perform a 
qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment. If, 

based on our qualitative review, we conclude that more likely 
than not a reporting unit™s fair value is less than its carrying 
amount, then we complete quantitative steps as described below 

to determine if there is goodwill 
impairment. If we conclude that 
127Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 a reporting unit fair value is not less than its carrying amount, 
quantitative tests are not required
. We have determined that our 
reporting units are one level below the operating segments. We 
assess goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level and 
apply various quantitative valuation methodologies when 
required to compare the estimated fair value to the carrying 
value of each reporting unit. Valuation methodologies include 

discounted cash flow and earnings multiple approaches. If the 
fair value is less than the carrying
 amount, an additional test is 
required to measure the amount of impairment. We recognize 

impairment losses as a charge 
to noninterest expense (unless 
related to discontinued operations) and an adjustment to the 

carrying value of the goodwill 
asset. Subsequent reversals of 
goodwill impairment are prohibited. 
 We amortize core deposit and other customer relationship 
intangibles on an accelerated basis over useful lives not 

exceeding 10 years. We review such intangibles for impairment 
whenever events or changes in ci
rcumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is 
indicated if the sum of undiscounted estimated future net cash 
flows is less than the carrying va
lue of the asset. Impairment is 
permanently recognized by writing down the asset to the extent 
that the carrying value exceed
s the estimated fair value.  
 Operating Lease Assets 

Operating lease rental income for 
leased assets is recognized in 
other income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Related 
depreciation expense is
 recorded on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life, considerin
g the estimated residual value of 
the leased asset. The useful life may be adjusted to the term of 
the lease depending on our plan
s for the asset after the lease 
term. On a periodic basis, leased assets are reviewed for 
impairment. Impairment loss is 
recognized if the carrying 
amount of leased assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. 
The carrying amount of leased assets is not recoverable if it 
exceeds the sum of the undiscou
nted cash flows expected to 
result from the lease payments 
and the estimated residual value 
upon the eventual disposit
ion of the equipment.  
 Liability for Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses 
We sell residential mortgage loans to various parties, including 
(1) Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (government-sponsored 

entities (GSEs)), which include the mortgage loans in GSE-

guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) special purpose entities 

that issue private label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions 

that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label 
securitization. In addition, we pool Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA)-insured and Department of Veterans 

Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans, which back securities 
guaranteed by the Government 
National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA). 

 We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, 
indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or 
reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit 
losses incurred on loans (collectively ﬁrepurchaseﬂ) in the event 
of a breach of specified contrac
tual representations or warranties 
that are not remedied within a period (usually 90 days or less) 
after we receive notice of the br
each. Our loan sale contracts to 
private investors (non-GSE) typically contain an additional 
provision where we would only be required to repurchase 

securitized loans if a breach is deemed to have a material and 
adverse effect on the value of 
the mortgage loan or to the 
investors or interests of security holders in the mortgage loan. 
 We establish mortgage repurchase liabilities related to 
various representations and 
warranties that reflect 
management™s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently 
service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Such 

factors include default expectations, expected investor 
repurchase demands (influenced by current and expected 
mortgage loan file requests and mortgage insurance rescissions 

notices, as well as estimated demand to default and file request 
relationships) and appeals success rates (where the investor 
rescinds the demand based on
 a cure of the defect or 
acknowledges that the loan sati
sfies the investor™s applicab
le 
representations and warranties), reimbursement by 

correspondent and other third party originators, and projected 
loss severity. We establish a liability at the time loans are sold 
and continually update our liability estimate during their life. 

Although investors may demand repurchase at any time and 
there is often a lag from the date 
of default to the time we receive 
a repurchase demand, the majority of repurchase demands occur 
on loans that default in the first 24 to 36 months following 
origination of the mortgage lo
an and can vary by investor. 
 The liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is included 
in other liabilities. For additional information on our repurchase 

liability, see Note 9.  
 Pension Accounting 
We account for our defined benefit pension plans using an 
actuarial model as more fully discussed in Note 20.  
 Income Taxes 
We file consolidated and separate company federal income tax 
returns, foreign tax returns and various combined and separate 
company state tax returns. 
We evaluate two components of income tax expense: current 
and deferred. Current income tax 
expense approximates taxes to 
be paid or refunded for the cu
rrent period and includes income 
tax expense related to our uncert
ain tax positions. We determine 
deferred income taxes using th
e balance sheet method. Under 
this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the 

tax effects of the differences be
tween the book and tax bases of 
assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates 
and laws in the period in which 
they occur. Deferred income tax 
expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized 

subject to management's judgment
 that realization is ﬁmore 
likely than not.ﬂ 
Uncertain tax positions that meet the more 
likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine 

the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is 
measured at the largest amount
 of benefit that management 
believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon 
settlement. Foreign taxes paid are generally applied as credits to 
reduce federal income taxes payable. We account for interest and 
penalties as a component of income tax expense. 

 128  Stock-Based Compensation 
We have stock-based employee compensation plans as more 

fully discussed in Note 19. Our compensation expense includes 
the associated costs for all share-based awards.  
 Earnings Per Common Share 
We compute earnings per common share by dividing net income 

(after deducting dividends and 
related accretion on preferred 
stock) by the average number of common shares outstanding 

during the year. We compute diluted earnings per common 

share by dividing net income 
(after deducting dividends and 
related accretion on preferred st
ock) by the average number of 
common shares outstanding during 
the year, plus the effect of 
common stock equivalents (for example, stock options, restricted 
share rights, convertible deben
tures and warrants) that are 
dilutive. 
 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
We recognize all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value. On 
the date we enter into a deriva
tive contract, we designate the 
derivative as (1) a hedge of the fa
ir value of a recognized asset or 
liability, including hedges of foreign currency exposure (ﬁfair 

valueﬂ hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the 
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a 

recognized asset or liability (ﬁcash flowﬂ hedge), or (3) held for 
trading, customer accommodation or asset/liability risk 
management purposes, including economic hedges not 

qualifying for hedge accounting. For a fair value hedge, we 

record changes in the fair value 
of the derivative and, to the 
extent that it is effective, change
s in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, in current period 

earnings in the same financial st
atement category as the hedged 
item. For a cash flow hedge, we record changes in the fair value 

of the derivative to the extent that
 it is effective in OCI, with any 
ineffectiveness recorded in current period earnings. We 

subsequently reclassify these changes in fair value to net income 

in the same period(s) that the 
hedged transaction affects net 
income in the same financial st
atement category as the hedged 
item. For free-standing derivatives,
 we report changes in the fair 
values in current period noninterest income. 
 For fair value and cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge 
accounting, we formally document
 at inception the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk 
management objective, strategy and our evaluation of 

effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This includes linking all 
derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to 
specific assets and liabilities in the balance sheet or to specific 
forecasted transactions. Periodically, as required, we also 

formally assess whether the deriva
tive we designated in each 
hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly 

effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the 

hedged item using the regression analysis method or, in limited 
cases, the dollar offset method. 
 We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) a 
derivative is no longer highly e
ffective in offsetting changes in 
the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) a derivative 

expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, (3) a derivative is de-

designated as a hedge, because it is unlikely that a forecasted 
transaction will occur, or (4) we elect to discontinue the 
designation of a derivative as a hedge. 

 When we discontinue hedge accounting because a derivative 
no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, we continue 
to carry the derivative in the bala
nce sheet at its fair value with 
changes in fair value included in earnings, and no longer adjust 

the previously hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. 

Previous adjustments to the hedg
ed item are accounted for in 
the same manner as other compon
ents of the carrying amount of 
the asset or liability. 

 When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting because 
the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or no longer 
designated (de-designated), the 
amount reported in OCI up to 
the date of sale, termination or de-designation continues to be 
reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting because it 

is probable that a forecasted 
transaction will not occur, we 
continue to carry the derivative 
in the balance sheet at its fair 
value with changes in fair value included in earnings, and 
immediately recognize gains and losses that were accumulated in 
OCI in earnings. 

 In all other situations in which we discontinue hedge 
accounting, the derivative will be 
carried at its fair value in the 
balance sheet, with changes in its fair value recognized in current 
period earnings. 
 We occasionally purchase or originate financial instruments 
that contain an embedded derivative. At inception of the 

financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic 

characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and 
closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial 
instrument (host contract), (2) if the financial instrument that 

embodies both the embedded deriva
tive and the host contract is 
not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in 

earnings, and (3) if a separate instrument with the same terms as 
the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a 
derivative. If the embedded de
rivative meets all of these 
conditions, we separate it from the host contract by recording 
the bifurcated derivative at fair value and the remaining host 
contract at the difference betw
een the basis of the hybrid 
instrument and the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. The 

bifurcated derivative is carried as a free-standing derivative at 
fair value with changes recorded in current period earnings. 

 Private Share Repurchases  
In December 2011, we entered in
to a private forward repurchase 
contract with an unrelated third party. This contract settled for 
approximately 6 million shares of our common stock in first 
quarter 2012. We also entered into a similar contract in 
August 2011, which settled in November 2011 for approximately 

6 million shares of our common stock. These contracts met 
accounting requirements to be treated as permanent equity 
transactions. We entered into th
ese contracts to complement our 
open-market common stock repurchase strategies, to allow us to 
manage our share repurchases in a manner consistent with our 
2011 Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Comprehensive Capital 

Analysis and Review plan (capital plan), and to provide an 
economic benefit to the Company. In connection with each 
contract, we paid $150 million 
to the counterparty, which was 
recorded in permanent equity and was not subject to re-
129Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(continued) 
 measurement. These up-front payments received permanent 
equity treatment in the quarter paid and thus assured 

appropriate repurchase timing, consistent with our 2011 capital 
plan which contemplated a fixed dollar amount available per 
quarter for share repurchases pursuant to FRB supervisory 
guidance. In return, the counterparty agreed to deliver a variable 
number of shares based on a per share discount to the volume-
weighted average stock price over the contract period. The 
counterparty had the right to accelerate settlement with delivery 

of shares prior to the contract
ual settlement. There were no 
scenarios where the contracts woul
d not either physically settle 
in shares or allow us to choose the settlement method.

   131  Note 3: Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions 
 Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulations require that each of 
our subsidiary banks maintain reserve balances on deposit with 
the Federal Reserve Banks. The average required reserve balance 
was $7.0 billion in 2011 an
d $6.0 billion in 2010. 
 Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit 

and non-credit transactions be
tween a bank and its nonbank 
affiliates. These tran
saction amounts may not exceed 10% of the 
bank's capital and surplus, whic
h for this purpose represents 
total capital, as calculated un
der the risk-based capital (RBC) 
guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses in 

excess of the amount included in total capital with any single 

nonbank affiliate and 20% of the bank's capital and surplus with 
all its nonbank affiliates. Transa
ctions that are extensions of 
credit may require collateral to be held to provide added security 
to the bank. For further discussion of RBC, see Note 26. 
 Dividends paid by our subsidiary banks are subject to various 
federal and state regulatory limi
tations. Dividends that may be 
paid by a national bank withou
t the express approval of the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are limited to 

that bank's retained net profit
s for the preceding two calendar 
years plus retained net profits up
 to the date of any dividend 
declaration in the current calendar
 year. Retained net profits, as 
defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends 

declared during the period. 
 We also have state-chartered subsidiary banks that are 

subject to state regulations that limit dividends. Under those 

provisions, our national and state-chartered subsidiary banks 
could have declared additional dividends of $0.6 billion at 
December 31, 2011, without obtain
ing prior regulatory approval. 
Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and 
state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount 
of dividends that may be paid
 in any given year. Based on 
retained earnings at December 31, 2011, our nonbank 
subsidiaries could have declared additional dividends of 
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2011, without obtaining prior 

approval. 
 The FRB published clarifying supervisory guidance in 2009, 
SR 09-4 Applying Supervisory Guidance and Regulations on 

the Payment of Dividends, Stock Redemptions, and Stock 
Repurchases at Bank Holding Companies,
 pertaining to FRB's 
criteria, assessment and approval process for reductions in 
capital including the redemption of Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP) and the 
payment of dividends. 
The effect of this 
guidance is to require the appr
oval of the FRB for the Company 
to repurchase or redeem common or perpetual preferred stock 
as well as to increase the per 
share dividend from its current 
level of $0.12 per share. In No
vember 2010, the FRB updated the 
SR 09-4 guidance to require the 
original 19 Supervisory Capital 
Assessment Program (SCAP) banks to submit a Capital Plan 

Review to the FRB no later than January 7, 2011. In 
December 2011, the FRB finalize
d rules under 12 CFR Part 225, 
Regulation Y requiring large bank holding companies (BHCs) to 
submit capital plans annually and to obtain regulatory approval 
before making capital distributi
ons including share dividend 
increases or share repurchases. The rule requires updates to 
capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC™s risk 
profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions. The

134  We do not have the intent to se
ll any securities included in the 
previous table. For debt securities
 included in the table, we have 
concluded it is more likely than not that we will not be required 
to sell prior to recovery of the 
amortized cost basis. We have 
assessed each security with gross unrealized losses for credit 
impairment. For debt securities, we evaluate, where necessary, 
whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present 
value of the expected cash
 flows to the securities
™ amortized cost 
basis. For equity securities, we consider numerous factors in 

determining whether impairment exists, including our intent 
and ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to 
recover the cost basis of the securities.  
 See Note 1 
Œ ﬁSecuritiesﬂ
 for the factors that
 we consider in 
our analysis of OTTI for debt and equity securities available for 
sale.  
 SECURITIES OF U.S. TREASURY AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND 
FEDERAL AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS)
  The unrealized losses associated with U.S. Treasury and federal 
agency securities and federal agency MBS are primarily driven 
by changes in interest rates and not due to credit losses given the 

explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government. 
 SECURITIES OF U.S. STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS
  The unrealized losses associated with securities of U.S. states 

and political subdivisions are primarily driven by changes in 
interest rates and not due to the credit quality of the securities. 

Substantially all of these invest
ments are investment grade. The 
securities were generally underwritten in accordance with our 
own investment standards prior to the decision to purchase. 
Some of these securities are guaranteed by a bond insurer, but 

we did not rely on this guarantee in making our investment 
decision. These investments will continue to be monitored as 
part of our ongoing impairment 
analysis, but are expected to 
perform, even if the rating agencies reduce the credit rating of 

the bond insurers. As a result, we expect to recover the entire 

amortized cost basis of these securities. 
 RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MBS
  The unrealized losses 
associated with private residential MBS and commercial MBS 

are primarily driven by changes in projected collateral losses, 
credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for credit 

impairment by estimating the pr
esent value of expected cash 
flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash flows 
include default rates, loss severities and prepayment rates. We 
estimate losses to a security by forecasting the underlying 
mortgage loans in each transaction. We use forecasted loan 
performance to project cash flows 
to the various tranches in the 
structure. We also consider cash flow forecasts and, as 
applicable, independent industry 
analyst reports and forecasts, 
sector credit ratings, and other independent market data. Based 
upon our assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit 
enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the 
entire amortized cost basi
s of these securities.  
 CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES
  The unrealized losses  
associated with corporate debt se
curities are primarily related to 
unsecured debt obligations issued by various corporations. We 
evaluate the financial performance 
of each issuer on a quarterly 
basis to determine that the issuer can make all contractual 
principal and interest payments. 
Based upon this assessment, we 
expect to recover the entire 
amortized cost basis of these 
securities.  

 COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOs)
  The unrealized 
losses associated with CDOs relate to securities primarily backed 

by commercial, residential or other consumer collateral. The 
unrealized losses are primarily dr
iven by changes in projected 
collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We assess for 
credit impairment by estimating 
the present value of expected 
cash flows. The key assumptions for determining expected cash 
flows include default rates, loss severities and prepayment rates. 
We also consider cash flow forecasts and, as applicable, 
independent industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit 

ratings, and other independent market data. Based upon our 
assessment of the expected credit losses and the credit 
enhancement level of the securities, we expect to recover the 
entire amortized cost ba
sis of these securities. 
 OTHER DEBT SECURITIES
  The unrealized losses associated with 
other debt securities primarily relate to other asset-backed 
securities. The losses are primarily driven by changes in 

projected collateral losses, credit spreads and interest rates. We 
assess for credit impairment by estimating the present value of 
expected cash flows. The key assumptions for determining 

expected cash flows include default rates, loss severities and 

prepayment rates. Based upon 
our assessment of the expected 
credit losses and the credit enha
ncement level of the securities, 
we expect to recover the entire
 amortized cost basis of these 
securities.  
 MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES
  Our marketable equity 
securities include investments in perpetual preferred securities, 
which provide very attractive tax-
equivalent yields. We evaluated 
these hybrid financial instruments with investment-grade 
ratings for impairment using an evaluation methodology similar 
to that used for debt securities. Perpetual preferred securities are 

not considered to be other-than-tem
porarily impaired if there is 
no evidence of credit deterioration or investment rating 

downgrades of any issuers to below investment grade, and we 

expect to continue to receive fu
ll contractual payments. We will 
continue to evaluate the pros
pects for these securities for 
recovery in their market value in accordance with our policy for 

estimating OTTI. We have recorded impairment write-downs on 
perpetual preferred securities wher
e there was evidence of credit 
deterioration. 
 OTHER SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE MATTERS  
The fair 
values of our investment securiti
es could decline in the future if 
the underlying performance of the collateral for the residential 
and commercial MBS or other securities deteriorate and our 
credit enhancement levels do not provide sufficient protection to 
our contractual principal and interest. As a result, there is a risk 
that significant OTTI may
 occur in the future. 
 The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair 
value of debt and perpetual prefer
red securities available for sale 
135Note 5:  Securities Available for Sale 
(continued) 
 by those rated investment grad
e and those rated less than 
investment grade, according to their lowest credit rating by 
Standard & Poor™s Rating Services (S&P) or Moody™s Investors 
Service (Moody™s). Credit ratings expres
s opinions about the 
credit quality of a security. Securities rated investment grade, 
that is those rated BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by 
Moody™s, are generally considered
 by the rating agencies and 
market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, securities 
rated below investment grade, labeled as ﬁspeculative gradeﬂ by 
the rating agencies, are consider
ed to be distinctively higher 
credit risk than investment grade securities. We have also 
included securities not rated by S&P or Moody™s in
 the table 
below based on the internal credit
 grade of the securities (used 
for credit risk management purpos
es) equivalent to the credit 
rating assigned by major credit agencies. The unrealized losses 

and fair value of unrated securities categorized as investment 
grade based on internal credit grades were $207 million and 
$6.2 billion, respectively, at De
cember 31, 2011, and $83 million 
and $1.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. If an 
internal credit grade was not 
assigned, we categorized the 
security as non-investment grade.

(2) Represents amounts recorded to OCI on debt securities in periods OTTI write-downs have occurred. Changes in fair value in subse
quent periods on such securities, to the 
extent additional credit-related OTTI did not occur, are not re
flected in this total. Increases represent OTTI write-downs reco
rded to OCI on debt securities in the periods 
non-credit related impairment has occurred. Decreases represent partial recoveries in the fair value of securities due to facto
rs other than credit, where the increase in fair 
value was not sufficient to recover the full amount of the unrealized loss on such securities. 
  The following table presents a rollforward of the credit loss 
component of OTTI recognized in earnings for debt securities we 
still own (referred to as ﬁcredit
-impairedﬂ debt securities). The 
credit loss component of the amo
rtized cost represents the 
difference between the present va
lue of expected future cash 
flows 
discounted using the security™s current effective interest 
rate and the amortized cost ba
sis of the security prior to 
considering credit losses. OTTI re
cognized in earnings for credit-
impaired debt securities is presented as additions and is 

classified into one of two components based upon whether the 
current period is the first time the debt security was credit-
impaired (initial credit impairment
) or if the debt security was 
previously credit-impaired (sub
sequent credit impairments). 
The credit loss component is reduced if we sell, intend to sell or 
believe we will be required to sell previously credit-impaired 
debt securities. Additionally, the credit loss component is 
reduced if we receive or expect to receive cash flows in excess of 

what we previously expected to re
ceive over the remaining life of 
the credit-impaired debt security, 
the security matures or is fully 
written down.  

 Changes in the credit loss comp
onent of credit-impaired debt 
securities that we do not intend to sell were:

(1) Recoveries of previous credit impairments result from increases in expected cash flows subsequent to credit loss recognition. S
uch recoveries are reflected prospectively as 
interest yield adjustments using the effective interest method. 
 139Note 5:  Securities Available for Sale 
(continued) 
 For asset-backed securities (e.g., residential MBS), we estimate 
expected future cash flows of the security by estimating the 

expected future cash flows of the underlying collateral and 
applying those collateral cash f
lows, together with any credit 
enhancements such as subordinated interests owned by third 
parties, to the security. The ex
pected future cash flows of the 
underlying collateral are de
termined using the remaining 
contractual cash flows adjusted for future expected credit losses 

(which consider current delinquencies and nonperforming assets 
(NPAs), future expected default rates and collateral value by 

vintage and geographic region) and prepayments. The expected 

cash flows of the security are then discounted at the 
security™s 
current effective interest rate to arrive at a present value 
amount. Total credit impairment 
losses on residential MBS that 
we do not intend to sell are sh
own in the table below. The table

rrower™s primary address is outside of the United States.
  Loan concentrations may ex
ist when there are amounts 
loaned to borrowers engaged in similar activities or similar types 
of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that would 
cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other 
conditions. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have 
concentrations representing 10% or more of our total loan 
portfolio in domestic commercial 
and industrial loans and lease 
financing by industry or CRE loans (real estate mortgage and 
real estate construction) by state or property type. Our real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loan
s to borrowers in the state of 
California represented approximately 13% of total loans at 
December 31, 2011 and 14% at December 31, 2010. For both 
periods, 3% of the amount were PCI loans. These loans are 

generally diversified among the larger metropolitan areas in 
California, with no single area consisting of more than 3% of 
total loans. We continuously mo
nitor changes in real estate 
values and underlying economic or market conditions for all 

geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage portfolio 
as part of our credit risk management process. 
 Some of our real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loans include an interest-only feature as part of the 
loan terms. These interest-only loans were approximately 21% of 

total loans at December 31, 2011 
and 25% at December 31, 2010. 
Substantially all of these interest
-only loans at origination were 
considered to be prime or near 
prime. We do not offer option 
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) products, nor do we offer 
variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, 
commonly referred to within the financial services industry as 

negative amortizing mortgage loans. 
 The following table summarizes 
the proceeds paid or received 
for purchases and sales of loans and transfers from (to) 

mortgages/loans held for sale at lower of cost or market. This 
loan activity primarily includes purchases or sales of commercial 
loan participation interests, whereby we receive or transfer a 
portion of a loan after originat
ion. The table excludes PCI loans 
and loans recorded at fair value, including loans originated for 
sale because their loan activity 
normally does not impact the 
allowance for credit losses.

 Commitments to Lend 
A commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to 

lend funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate and for 
a specified purpose. These commitments have fixed expiration 
dates and generally require a fee. When we make such a 

commitment, we have credit risk. The liquidity requirements or 
credit risk will be lower than the contractual amount of 
commitments to extend credit be
cause a significant portion of 
these commitments are expected to expire without being used. 
Certain commitments are subject to loan agreements with 

covenants regarding the financia
l performance of the customer 
or borrowing base formulas that
 must be met before we are 
required to fund the commitment. Also, in some cases we 

participate a portion of our commitment to others in an 
arrangement that reduces our contractual commitment amount. 
We use the same credit policies 
in extending credit for unfunded 
commitments and letters of credit
 that we use in making loans. 
See Note 14 for information on standby letters of credit. 

 In addition, we manage the potential risk in credit 

commitments by limiting the 
total amount of arrangements, 
both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size 
and maturity structure of these 
portfolios and by applying the 
same credit standards for all of our credit activities. 
  For certain extensions of credit, we may require collateral, 
based on our assessment of a customer™s credit risk. We hold 
various types of collateral, including accounts receivable, 
inventory, land, buildings, equipment, autos, financial 
instruments, income-producing commercial properties and 

residential real estate. Collateral
 requirements for each customer 
may vary according to the specif
ic credit underwriting, terms 
and structure of loans funded immediately or under a 
commitment to fund at a later date. 
 The contractual amount of our unfunded credit 

commitments, net of participations and net of all standby and 
commercial letters of credit issued under the terms of these 
commitments, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of 

financing receivable in the following table:

 142  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 
The ACL is 
management™s estimate of credit losses inherent in 
the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, at 
the balance sheet date. We have an established process to 
determine the adequacy of the al
lowance for credit losses that 
assesses the losses inherent in our portfolio and related 
unfunded credit commitments. Wh
ile we attribute portions of 
the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance 
is available to absorb credit l
osses inherent in the total loan 
portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. 
 Our process involves procedur
es to appropriately consider 
the unique risk characteristics of our commercial and consumer 

loan portfolio segments. For each portfolio segment, losses are 

estimated collectively for groups of loans with similar 
characteristics, individually or pooled for impaired loans or, for 
PCI loans, based on the changes 
in cash flows expected to be 
collected. 
 Our allowance levels are influenced by loan volumes, loan 
grade migration or delinquency st
atus, historic loss experience 
influencing loss factors, and other conditions influencing loss 

expectations, such as economic conditions.  

  COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY 
Generally, commercial loans are as
sessed for estimated losses by 

grading each loan using various ri
sk factors as identified through 
periodic reviews. We apply historic grade-specific loss factors to 

the aggregation of each funded 
grade pool. These historic loss 
factors are also used to estima
te losses for unfunded credit 
commitments. In the development of our statistically derived 
loan grade loss factors, we observe historical losses over a 
relevant period for each loan grade. These loss estimates are 

adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of long-
term average loss experience comp
ared to previously forecasted 
losses, external loss data or other risks identified from current 
economic conditions and credit quality trends.  
 The allowance also includes an amount for the estimated 

impairment on nonaccrual commercial loans and commercial 
loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. 

 CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY
  For 
consumer loans, not identified as a TDR, we determine the 

allowance predominantly on a collective basis utilizing 

forecasted losses to represent our best estimate of inherent loss. 

We pool loans, generally by product types with similar risk 

characteristics, such as residential real estate mortgages and 
credit cards. As appropriate and 
to achieve greater accuracy, we 
may further stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, 
origination channel, vintage, loss type, geographic location and 
other predictive characteristics. Models designed for each pool 
are utilized to develop the loss 
estimates. We use assumptions 
for these pools in our forecast
 models, such as historic 
delinquency and default, loss 
severity, home price trends, 
unemployment trends, and other key economic variables that 

may influence the frequency and se
verity of losses in the pool.  
 In determining the appropriat
e allowance attributable to our 
residential mortgage portfolio, 
we incorporate the default rates 
and high severity of loss for junior lien mortgages behind 
delinquent first lien mortgages into our loss forecasting 
calculations. In addition, the lo
ss rates we use in determining 
our allowance include the impact of our established loan 
modification programs. When modifications occur or are 
probable to occur, our allowanc
e considers the im
pact of these 
modifications, taking into cons
ideration the associated credit 
cost, including re-defaults of modified loans and projected loss 

severity. Accordingly, the loss co
ntent associated with the effects 
of existing and probable loan modifications and junior lien 

mortgages behind delinquent first lien mortgages has been 

captured in our allowance methodology. 
 We separately estimate impairment for consumer loans that 
have been modified in a TDR (including trial modifications), 

whether on accrual or nonaccrual status. 
 OTHER ACL MATTERS
  The allowance for credit losses for both 
portfolio segments includes an
 amount for imprecision or 
uncertainty that may change from period to period. This amount 
represents management™s judgment of risks inherent in the 
processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance. 
This imprecision considers economic environmental factors, 

modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other 
subjective factors, including industry trends and ongoing 
discussions with regulatory and government agencies regarding 

mortgage foreclosure-related matters. 
 Impaired loans, which predominantly include nonaccrual 
commercial loans and any loans that have been modified in a 

TDR, have an estimated allowance 
calculated as the difference, if 
any, between the impaired valu
e of the loan and the recorded 
investment in the loan. The im
paired value of the loan is 
generally calculated as the present value of expected future cash 

flows from principal and interest which incorporates expected 
lif
etime losses, discounted at the 
loan™s effective interest rate. 
The allowance for a non-impaired loan is based solely on 
principal losses without consideration for timing of those losses. 
The allowance for an impaired lo
an that was modified in a TDR 
may be lower than the previously established allowance for that 
loan due to benefits received through modification, such as lower 
probability of default and/or severity of loss, and the impact of 

prior charge-offs or charge-offs at
 the time of the modification 
that may reduce or eliminate the need for an allowance. 

 Commercial and consumer PCI loans may require an 

allowance subsequent to their acquisition. This allowance 

requirement is due to probable decreases in expected principal 

and interest cash flows (other than due to decreases in interest 

rate indices and changes in prepayment assumptions).

 Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality as indicated by evaluating various 
attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the 

adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The following 
sections provide the credit quality indicators we most closely 
monitor. 
See the ﬁPurchased Cre
dit-Impaired Loansﬂ section of 
this Note for credit quality information on our PCI portfolio.  
 The majority of credit quality indicators are based on 
December 31, 2011 information, 
with the exception of updated 
FICO and updated loan-to-value (LTV)/combined LTV (CLTV), 

which are obtained at least quarte
rly. Generally, these indicators 
are updated in the second month 
of each quarter, with updates 
no older than September 30, 2011. 

 COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS 
In addition to 
monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a 

consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 

Commercial loans are subject to in
dividual risk assessment using 
our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings 

are aligned to Pass and Criticiz
ed categories. The Criticized 
category includes Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful 
categories which are defined by bank regulatory agencies. 
 The following table provides a breakdown of outstanding 
commercial loans by risk category. Both the CRE mortgage and 
construction criticized totals are re
latively high as a result of the 
current conditions in the real es
tate market. Of the $29.3 billion 
in criticized CRE loans, $6.0 billion has been placed on 

nonaccrual status and wr
itten down to net realizable value. CRE 
loans have a high level of moni
toring in place 
to manage these 
assets and mitigate any loss exposure.

                        CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS
  We have various 
classes of consumer loans that pr
esent respective unique risks. 
Loan delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV for loan types are 
common credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in 
our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
for the consumer portfolio segment.  
 The majority of our loss estimation techniques used for the 

allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency matrix models or 
delinquency roll rate models. Therefore, delinquency is an 

important indicator of credit qu
ality and the establishment of 
our allowance for credit losses.

(1) Represents loans whose repayments are insured by the FHA or guar
anteed by the VA and student loans whose repayments are predomi
nantly guaranteed by agencies on 
behalf of the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). In 2011, we consolidated $5
.6 billion of previously sold FHA insured 
real estate 1-4 family reverse mortgages. 
(2) Amounts at December 31, 2010, have been revised to conform to the current separate presentation of government insured/guarantee
d loans. 
  Of the $11.5 billion of loans that
 are 90 days or more past due 
at December 31, 2011, $1.5 bill
ion was accruing, compared with 
$13.0 billion past due and $2.0 billion accruing at 
December 31, 2010. 

 Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans 180 days or more 
past due totaled $6.7 billion, or
 3.3%, of total first mortgages 
(excluding PCI), at December 31, 2011, compared with 
$6.8 billion, or 3.4%, at December 31, 2010. The aging of the 
delinquent real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans is a result 

of the prolonged foreclosure process and our effort to help 
customers stay in their homes through various loan modification 
programs, as loans continue to
 age until these processes are 
complete. 
  The following table provides a breakdown of our consumer 
portfolio by updated FICO. We obtain FICO scores at loan 
origination and the scores are upda
ted at least quarterly. FICO is 
not available for certain loan types. In addition, FICO may not be 

obtained if we deem it unnecess
ary due to strong collateral and 
other borrower attributes, primarily securities-based margin 

loans of $5.0 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 

2010, respectively. The majority of our portfolio is underwritten 
with a FICO score of 680 and above.

  LTV refers to the ratio compar
ing the loan™s balance to the 
property™s collateral value. CLTV refers to the combination of 
first mortgage and junior lien mortgage (including unused line 

amounts for credit line products) ratios. LTVs and CLTVs are 
updated quarterly using a cascade approach which first uses 
values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the 
property. If an AVM is not availa
ble, then the value is estimated 
using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in 
Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is 

not available, the original apprai
sed value is used. The HPI value 
is normally the only method cons
idered for high value properties 
as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these 

properties. 
 The following table shows th
e most updated LTV and CLTV 
distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loan portfolios. In recent years, the residential real 

estate markets have experienced significant declines in property 
values and several markets, particularly California and Florida 
have experienced declines that turned out to be more significant 
than the national decline. These 
trends are considered in the way 
that we monitor credit risk and 
establish our allowance for credit 
losses. LTV does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of 

performance of a given loan, but does provide an indication of 

collateral value. In the event of a default, any loss should be 
limited to the portion of the lo
an amount in excess of the net 
realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral value. 
Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV primarily due to 

industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or 

serviced by other institutions.

 LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING
  Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal 
are still accruing, because they 
are (1) well-secured and in the 
process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until late
r delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans of $8.7 billi
on at December 31, 2011, and 
$11.6 billion at December 31, 
2010, are excluded from this 
disclosure even though they are 
90 days or more contractually 
past due. These PCI loans are cons
idered to be accruing due to 
the existence of the accretab
le yield and not based on 
consideration given to contractual interest payments. Loans 90 
days or more past due and stil
l accruing whose repayments are 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or 
predominantly guaranteed by 
the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) for mortgages and the U.S. Department of 
Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education 
Loan Program were $20.5 billion at December 31, 2011, up from 
$15.8 billion at December 31, 20
10, due primarily to growth in 
the FHA/VA portfolio over the past two years and the 

subsequent seasoning of those loans.

150  IMPAIRED LOANS
  The table below summarizes key information 
for impaired loans. Our impaired loans predominately include 
loans on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio segment 
and loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. These impaired loans may
 have estimated loss which is 
included in the allowance for cr
edit losses. Impaired loans 

exclude PCI loans. Upon our adoption of ASU No. 2011-02 in 

third quarter 2011, we identified commercial loans that were not 
previously included as impaired loans, which totaled 
$685 million with an associated allowance for credit losses of 

$54 million. The allowance for cred
it losses associated with these 
loans would have been measured under a collectively evaluated 
basis prior to adoption, but is 
now estimated on an individually 
evaluated basis. Our consumer loans were not impacted by the 
adoption of ASU No. 2011-02. Additionally, based on clarifying 
guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
received in December 2011, we now classify trial modifications 
as TDRs at the beginning of th
e trial period. The table below 
includes trial modifications th
at totaled $651 million at 
December 31, 2011.

policies on impaired loans and PCI loans.

  Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose terms 
have been modified in a TDR amounted to $3.8 billion and 

$1.2 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 
significant portion of these co
mmitments relate to commercial 
and industrial loans, which, at the time of modification, had an 
amount of availability to the borrower that continues under the 
modified terms of the TDR. Thes
e TDRs totaled $1.8 billion and 
$345 million at December 31
, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 152  TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)
  When, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower™s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession
 for other than an insignificant 
period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR. We do not 
consider any loans modified through a loan resolution such as 
foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. The following table 

summarizes how our loans were modified as TDRs in 2011,

f concessions are presented only once in the

(2) Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time
 of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted
 over the life of the loan based on borrower 
performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual
 interest rate. 
(3) Other interest rate concessions include loans modified to an interest rate that is not commensurate with the credit risk, even 
though the rate may have been increased. 
These modifications would include renewals, term extensions, and other interest adjustments, but exclude modifications that als
o forgive principal and/or reduce the interest 
rate. 
(4) Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period of modification. In some cases, the amount of charg
e-offs will differ from the modification terms 
if the loan has already been charged down based on our policies. Modifications resulted in forgiving principal (actual, conting
ent or deferred) of $577 million in 2011. 
(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, thes
e loans continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally inclu
des interest rate related concessions; 
however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified.
  153Note 6:  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 
(continued) 
 The previous table presents
 information on all loan 
modifications classified as TDRs. We may require some 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to make trial 
payments generally for a period of three to four months, 
according to terms of a planned permanent modification, to 
determine if they can perform a
ccording to those terms. Based 
on clarifying guidance from the SEC in December 2011, these 
arrangements represent trial modifications, which we classify 
and account for as TDRs. The tria
l period terms are developed in 
accordance with our proprietary programs or the U.S. Treasury™s 
Making Homes Affordable programs for real estate 1-4 family 
first lien (i.e. Home Affordable Modification Program 
Œ HAMP) 
and junior lien (i.e. Second Lien Modification Program 
Œ 2MP) 
mortgage loans. At December 31, 2011, we had $421 million, 

$46 million, and $184 million of loans in a trial modification 
period under HAMP, 2MP, and proprietary programs, 

respectively. While loans are in trial payment programs their 
original terms are not considered 
modified and they continue to 
advance through delinquency status and accrue interest 
according to their original terms. The planned modifications for 
these arrangements predominan
tly involve interest rate 
reductions or other interest rate concessions.
 At December 31, 2011, trial modifications with a recorded 
investment of $310 million were accruing loans and $341 million 

were nonaccruing loans.
 Our recent experience is that most of 
the mortgages that enter a tria
l payment period program are 
successful in completing the pr
ogram requirements and are then 
permanently modified at the 
end of the trial period. As 
previously discussed, our allowance process considers the 
impact of those modifications 
that are probable to occur 
including the associated credit cost and related re-default risk. 
 
 
     
   
   
   
     
   
   
 
  The table below summarizes permanent modification TDRs 
that have defaulted in the current period within 12 months of 
their permanent modification date. We are reporting these 
defaulted TDRs based on a payment 
default definition of 90 days 
past due for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past 
due for the consumer portfolio segment.

                    ACCRETABLE YIELD
  The excess of cash flows expected to be 
collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the 
accretable yield and is recognized
 in interest income using an 
effective yield method over the 
remaining life of the loan, or 
pools of loans. The accretable yield is affected by: 
 Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans 
Œ Expected future cash flows are ba
sed on the variable rates in 
effect at the time of the regular evaluations of cash flows 

expected to be collected; 
 Changes in prepayment assumptions 
Œ Prepayments affect 
the estimated life of PCI 
loans which may change the 
amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected

 PCI ALLOWANCE  
Based on our regular evaluation of estimates 
of cash flows expected to be collected, we may establish an 
allowance for a PCI loan or pool of loans, with a charge to 
income through the provision fo
r losses. The following table

 159  Note 8: Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities      
  Involvement with SPEs 
In the normal course of business,
 we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corpor
ations, trusts or partnerships 
that are established for a limi
ted purpose. Historically, the 
majority of SPEs were formed in connection with securitization 
transactions. In a securitization
 transaction, assets from our 
balance sheet are transferred to 
an SPE, which then issues to 
investors various forms of interests in those assets and may also 
enter into derivative transactions. In a securitization transaction, 

we typically receive cash and/or
 other interests in an SPE as 
proceeds for the assets we transf
er. Also, in certain transactions, 
we may retain the right to service the transferred receivables and 

to repurchase those receivables 
from the SPE if the outstanding 
balance of the receivables falls to
 a level where the cost exceeds 
the benefits of servicing such receivables. In addition, we may 

purchase the right to service loans in an SPE that were 

transferred to the SPE by a third party. 

 In connection with our securitization activities, we have 
various forms of ongoing involvement with SPEs, which may 
include: 

Ł underwriting securities issued by SPEs and subsequently 
making markets in those securities; 
Ł providing liquidity facilities to support short-term 
obligations of SPEs issued to third party investors; 
Ł providing credit enhancement on securities issued by SPEs 

or market value guarantees of assets held by SPEs through 

the use of letters of credit, 
financial guarantees, credit 
default swaps and to
tal return swaps; 
Ł entering into other derivative contracts with SPEs; 
Ł holding senior or subordinated interests in SPEs;  
Ł acting as servicer or investment manager for SPEs; and 
Ł providing administrative or trustee services to SPEs. 
   SPEs are generally considered variable interest entities 
(VIEs). A VIE is an entity th
at has either a total equity 
investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without 

additional subordinated financial support or whose equity 

investors lack the ability to c
ontrol the entity™s activities. A 
VIE is 
consolidated by its primary benefi
ciary, the party that has both 
the power to direct the activities
 that most significantly impact 
the VIE and a variable interest that could potentially be 

significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, 
ownership or other interest that 
changes with changes in the fair 
value of the VIE™s net assets. To determine whether or not a 

variable interest we hold could 
potentially be significant to the 
VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors 

regarding the nature, size and fo
rm of our involvement with the 
VIE. We assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of 
a VIE on an on-going basis. 
 We have segregated our involvement with VIEs between 

those VIEs which we consolida
te, those which we do not 
consolidate and transfers of fina
ncial assets that are accounted 
for as secured borrowings. Secu
red borrowings are transactions 
involving transfers of our financial 
assets to third parties that are 
accounted for as financings with 
the assets pledged as collateral. 
Accordingly, the transferred assets remain recognized on our 

balance sheet. Subsequent tables within this Note further 

segregate these transactio
ns by structure type.
 160  The classifications of assets and liabilities in our balance 
sheet associated with our transactions with VIEs follow:

  Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
Our transactions with VIEs include securitizations of residential 
mortgage loans, CRE loans, student loans and auto loans and 
leases; investment and financing activities involving CDOs 
backed by asset-backed and CRE securities, collateralized loan 
obligations (CLOs) backed by corporate loans, and other types of 

structured financing. We have various forms of involvement with 
VIEs, including holding senior 
or subordinated interests, 
entering into liquidity arrangem
ents, credit default swaps and 
other derivative contracts. Involvements with these 
unconsolidated VIEs are recorded on our balance sheet 
primarily in trading assets, securities available for sale, loans, 
MSRs, other assets and other liabilities, as appropriate. 
The following tables provide a summary of unconsolidated 
VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement, but 

we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our 
continuing involvement in an unconsolidated VIE to be 
significant when it relates to third-party sponsored VIEs for 
which we were not the transferor 
or if we were the sponsor but 
do not have any other significant continuing involvement. 
 Significant continuing involvement includes transactions 
where we were the sponsor or
 transferor and have other 
significant forms of involvement. Sponsorship includes 
transactions with unconsolidated VIEs where we solely or 
materially participated 
in the initial design or structuring of the 
entity or marketing of the tran
saction to investors. When we 
transfer assets to a VIE and accoun
t for the transfer as a sale, we 
are considered the transferor. 
We consider investments in 
securities held outside of trading, loans, guarantees, liquidity 
161Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) 
 agreements, written options and servicing of collateral to be 
other forms of involvement that may be significant. We have 

excluded certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs from the 
balances presented in the table 
below where we have determined 
that our continuing involvement is not significant due to the 
temporary nature and size of our variable interests, because we 

were not the transferor or becaus
e we were not involved in the 
design or operations of the unconsolidated VIEs.

 (2) Represents senior loans to trusts that are collateralized by asset-backed securities. The trusts invest primarily in senior tra
nches from a diversified pool of primarily U.S. 
asset securitizations, of which all are current, and over 88% were rated as investment grade by the primary rating agencies at 
December 31, 2011. These senior loans were 
acquired in the Wachovia business combination and are accounted for at amortized cost as initially determined under purchase 
accounting and are subject to the Company™s 
allowance and credit charge-off policies.
 (3) Includes structured financing, student loan securitizations, auto loan and lease securitizations and credit-linked note structu
res. Also contains investments in auction rate 
securities (ARS) issued by VIEs that we do not sponsor and, accordingly, are unable to obtain the total assets of the entity. 
163Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) 
  In the two preceding tables, ﬁTot
al VIE assetsﬂ represents the 
remaining principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated 
VIEs using the most current infor
mation available. For VIEs that 
obtain exposure to assets synthetically through derivative 
instruments, the remaining notion
al amount of the derivative is 
included in the asset balance. ﬁCarrying valueﬂ is the amount in 

our consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with 

the unconsolidated VIEs. ﬁMaximum exposure to lossﬂ fro
m our 
involvement with off-balance sheet entities, which is a required 

disclosure under GAAP, is determined as the carrying value of 

our involvement with off-balance sheet (unconsolidated) VIEs 
plus the remaining undrawn liqu
idity and lending commitments, 
the notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and 
generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, 
other commitments and guarantees. It represents estimated loss 
that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical 

circumstances, for which we beli
eve the possibility is extremely 
remote, such as where the value of our interests and any 

associated collateral declines to
 zero, without any consideration 
of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, 

this required disclosure is not an indication of expected loss. 

 RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS
  Residential mortgage loan 
securitizations are financed through the issuance of fixed- or 

floating-rate-asset-backed-securities, which are collateralized by 
the loans transferred to a VIE. 
We typically transfer loans we 
originated to these VIEs, account fo
r the transfers as sales, retain 
the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial 

interests issued by the VIEs. We also may be exposed to limited 
liability related to recourse agreements and repurchase 
agreements we make to our issuers and purchasers, which are 

included in other commitments and guarantees. In certain 
instances, we may service residential mortgage loan 
securitizations structured by th
ird parties whose loans we did 
not originate or transfer. Our residential mortgage loan 

securitizations consist of co
nforming and nonconforming 
securitizations. 
 Conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations are 
those that are guaranteed by GS
Es, including GNMA. We do not 
consolidate our conforming residential mortgage loan 
securitizations because we do not have power over the VIEs. 
 The loans sold to the VIEs in nonconforming residential 

mortgage loan securitizations are those that do not qualify for a 

GSE guarantee. We may hold vari
able interests issued by the 
VIEs, primarily in the form of 
senior securities. We do not 
consolidate the nonconforming residential mortgage loan 
securitizations included in the ta
ble because we either do not 
hold any variable interests, hold 
variable interests that we do not 
consider potentially significant 
or are not the primary servicer 
for a majority of the VIE assets. 
 Other commitments and guarantees include amounts related 

to loans sold that we may be required to repurchase, or 
otherwise indemnify or reimburs
e the investor or insurer for 
losses incurred, due to material breach of contractual 
representations and warranties. 
The maximum exposure to loss 
for material breach of contractual representations and 

warranties represents a stressed case estimate we utilize for 
determining stressed case regu
latory capital needs and is 
considered to be a remote scenario. 
 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS 
Commercial mortgage loan securitizations are financed through 

the issuance of fixed- or floating-rate-asset-backed-securities, 

which are collateralized by the loans transferred to the VIE. In a 

typical securitization, we may tr
ansfer loans we originate to 
these VIEs, account for the transfer
s as sales, retain the right to 
service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued 
by the VIEs. In certain instan
ces, we may service commercial 
mortgage loan securitizations structured by third parties whose 

loans we did not originate or transfer. We typically serve as 

primary or master servicer of these VIEs. The primary or master 
servicer in a commercial mortgage loan securitization typically 
cannot make the most significant decisions impacting the 

performance of the VIE and therefore does not have power over 
the VIE. We do not consolidate the commercial mortgage loan 
securitizations included in the di
sclosure because we either do 
not have power or do not have a variable interest that could 

potentially be significant to the VIE. 

 COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS (CDOs)
  A CDO is a securitization where an SPE purchases a pool of assets consisting 

of asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches of equity 
or notes to investors. In some transactions, a portion of the 
assets are obtained synthetically through the use of derivatives 

such as credit default swaps or total return swaps. 

 Prior to 2008, we engaged in
 the structuring of CDOs on 
behalf of third party asset ma
nagers who would select and 
manage the assets for the CDO. Ty
pically, the asset manager has 
some discretion to manage the sale of assets of, or derivatives 
used by the CDO, which genera
lly gives the asset manager the 
power over the CDO. We have 
not structured these types of 
transactions since the 
credit market disruption began in late 
2007. 
 In addition to our role as ar
ranger we may have other forms 
of involvement with these transa
ctions, including transactions 
established prior to 2008. Such 
involvement may include acting 
as liquidity provider, derivative
 counterparty, secondary market 
maker or investor. For certain tr
ansactions, we may also act as 
the collateral manager or servicer. We receive fees in connection 

with our role as collateral manager or servicer. 

 We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of CDOs 

based on our role in the transa
ction in combination with the 
variable interests we hold. Subsequently, we monitor our 
ongoing involvement in these tran
sactions to determine if the 
nature of our involvement has changed. We are not the primary 
beneficiary of these transactions 
in most cases because we do not 
act as the collateral manager or servicer, which generally denotes 

power. In cases where we are the collateral manager or servicer, 

we are not the primary benefici
ary because we do not hold 
interests that could potentially
 be significant to the VIE. 
 In 2011, we incurred a $377 million loss on trading 

derivatives related to certain CDOs. The loss was associated with 
the resolution of a legacy Wachovia position that settled during 
the year. 
164  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS (CLOs)
  A CLO is a 
securitization where an SPE purcha
ses a pool of assets consisting 
of loans and issues multiple tranches of equity or notes to 
investors. Generally, CLOs are st
ructured on behalf of a third 
party asset manager that typically
 selects and manages the assets 
for the term of the CLO. Typically, the asset manager has the 
power over the significant decisions of the VIE through its 

discretion to manage the assets 
of the CLO. We assess whether 
we are the primary beneficiary of CLOs based on our role in the 

transaction and the variable intere
sts we hold. In most cases, we 
are not the primary beneficiary of
 these transactions because we 
do not have the power to manage
 the collateral in the VIE. 
 In addition to our role as arranger, we may have other forms 

of involvement with these tran
sactions. Such involvement may 
include acting as underwriter, derivative counterparty, 

secondary market maker or invest
or. For certain transactions, 
we may also act as the servicer
, for which we receive fees in 
connection with that role. We also
 earn fees for arranging these 

transactions and distributing the securities. 
 ASSET-BASED FINANCE STRUCTURES
  We engage in various 
forms of structured finance arrangements with VIEs that are 

collateralized by various asset classes including energy contracts, 
auto and other transportation leases, intellectual property, 

equipment and general corporate credit. We typically provide 
senior financing, and may act as an interest rate swap or 
commodity derivative counterparty when necessary. In most 

cases, we are not the primary beneficiary of these structures 

because we do not have power over
 the significant activities of 
the VIEs involved in
 these transactions. 
 For example, we have investme
nts in asset-backed securities 
that are collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash reserves. 
These fixed-rate and variable-rate securities have been 
structured as single-tranche, fully amortizing, unrated bonds 
that are equivalent to investment
-grade securities due to their 
significant overcollateralization. The securities are issued by 
VIEs that have been formed 
by third party auto financing 
institutions primarily because they
 require a source of liquidity 
to fund ongoing vehicle sales operations. The third party auto 

financing institutions manage the collateral in the VIEs, which is 
indicative of power in these tran
sactions and we therefore do not 
consolidate these VIEs. 
  TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES
  We co-sponsor and make 
investments in affordable housing and sustainable energy 

projects that are designed to ge
nerate a return primarily through 
the realization of federal tax cr
edits. In some instances, our 
investments in these structures may require that we fund future 

capital commitments at the discre
tion of the project sponsors. 
While the size of our investment in a single entity may at times 

exceed 50% of the outstanding equity interests, we do not 

consolidate these structures due to the project sponsor™s ability 
to manage the projects, which is 
indicative of power in these 
transactions. 
 INVESTMENT FUNDS
  We do not consolidate the investment 
funds because we do not absorb
 the majority of the expected 
future variability associated with the funds™ assets, including 
variability associated with credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. 

 During 2011, we redeemed a 
$1.4 billion interest in an 
unconsolidated investment fund managed by one of our majority 
owned subsidiaries. Upon redemption we placed the assets 
received into new investment fund VIEs. We consolidated these 
new VIEs because we have disc
retion over the management of 
the assets and are the sole in
vestor in these funds. At 
December 31, 2010, we had investments of $1.4 billion and 

lending arrangements of $14 million with this fund.  

 OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH VIEs
  In 2008, legacy Wachovia 
reached an agreement to purchase at par auction rate securities 

(ARS) that were sold to third-pa
rty investors by certain of its 
subsidiaries. ARS are debt instruments with long-term 

maturities, but which re-price more frequently, and preferred 

equities with no maturity. We purchased all outstanding ARS 
that were issued by VIEs and subject to the agreement. At 
December 31, 2011, we held in our securities available-for-sale 
portfolio $643 million of ARS issued by VIEs redeemed pursuant 
to this agreement, compared with $1.6 billion at 

December 31, 2010. 
 In 2009, we reached agreements
 to purchase additional ARS 
from eligible investors who bo
ught ARS through one of our 
broker-dealer subsidiaries. We purchased all outstanding ARS 

that were issued by VIEs and su
bject to the agreement. As of 
December 31, 2011, we held in our securities available-for-sale 
portfolio $624 million of ARS issued by VIEs redeemed pursuant 

to this agreement, compar
ed with $901 million at 
December 31, 2010. 

 We do not consolidate the VIEs
 that issued the ARS because 
we do not have power over the activities of the VIEs.  
 TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES
  In addition to the involvements disclosed in the 
preceding table, through the 
issuance of trust preferred securities we had junior subordinated 

debt financing with a carrying value of $7.6 billion at 
December 31, 2011, and $19.3 billion at December 31, 2010, and 
$2.5 billion of preferred stock at December 31, 2011. In these 

transactions, VIEs that
 we wholly own issue debt securities or 
preferred equity to third party inve
stors. All of the proceeds of 
the issuance are invested in debt
 securities or preferred equity 
that we issue to the VIEs. 
The VIEs™ operations and cash flows 
relate only to the issuance, admi
nistration and repayment of the 
securities held by third parties. We do not consolidate these VIEs 

because the sole assets of the VI
Es are receivables from us. This 
is the case even though
 we own all of the voting equity shares of 
the VIEs, have fully guaranteed 
the obligations of the VIEs and 
may have the right to redeem the third party securities under 
certain circumstances. We report the debt securities issued to 

the VIEs as long-term junior
 subordinated debt and the 
preferred equity securities issued 
to the VIEs as preferred stock 
in our consolidated balance sheet. 
 In 2011, we redeemed $9.2 bill
ion of trust preferred securities 
that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank 
Act and the Basel Committee guidelines known as the Basel III 
standards.  
165Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) 
  Securitization Activity Related to Unconsolidated 
VIEs 
We use VIEs to securitize consumer and CRE loans and other 
types of financial assets, including student loans and auto loans. 
We typically retain the servicing 
rights from these sales and may 
continue to hold other beneficial
 interests in the VIEs. We may 
also provide liquidity to investor
s in the beneficial interests and 
credit enhancements in the form of standby letters of credit. 
Through these securitizations we may be exposed to liability 
under limited amounts of recourse as well as standard 
representations and warranties we make to purchasers and 

issuers. 
 In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized net gains of 
$112 million, $27 million, and $1 million, respectively, from 
transfers accounted for as sales of financial assets in 
securitizations. Additionally, we
 had the following cash flows 
with our securitization trusts th
at were involved in transfers 
accounted for as sales.

  Sales with continuing involvement during 2011 and 2010 
predominantly related to conforming residential mortgage 

securitizations. During 2011 and 2010, we transferred 
$329.1 billion and $379
.0 billion, respectively, in fair value of 
conforming residential mortgages to unconsolidated VIEs and 
recorded the transfers as sales. Th
ese transfers did not result in a 
gain or loss because the loans are already carried at fair value. In 

connection with these transfer
s, in 2011 we recorded a 
$4.0 billion servicing asset, measured at fair value using a Level 
3 measurement technique, and a $101 million liability for 
probable repurchase losses. In 2010, we recorded a $4.5 billion 

servicing asset, with $4.1 billion recorded at fair value as Level 3 
and the remaining $400 million re
corded as amortized mortgage 
servicing rights. We also recorded a $144 million repurchase 
liability in 2010. 
 We used the following key weighted-average assumptions to 

measure mortgage servicing assets at the date of securitization:

fair value to immediate adverse 
changes in those assumptions at 
December 31, 2011, for residential and commercial mortgage 
servicing rights, and other interests held related primarily to 
residential mortgage loan securi
tizations are presented in the 
following table. 
ﬁOther interests heldﬂ exclude residential 
mortgage-backed securities retained in securitizations issued 

through GSEs, such as FNMA
, FHLMC and GNMA, because 
these securities have 
a remote risk of credit loss due to the GSE 
guarantee. These securities also have economic characteristics 
similar to GSE mortgage-backed securities that we purchase, 

which are not included in the 
table. Subordinated interests 
include only those bonds whose credit rating was below AAA by 
a major rating agency at issuance. Senior interests include only 
those bonds whose credit rating was AAA by a major rating 
agency at issuance. The informat
ion presented excludes trading 
positions held in inventory.

caution should be exercised when relying on this data. Changes 
in value based on variations in
 assumptions generally cannot be 
extrapolated because the relation
ship of the ch
ange in the assumption to the change in va
lue may not be linear. Also, the 
effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of 
the other interests held is ca
lculated independently without 
changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one 
factor may result in changes in others (for example, changes in 
prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in the credit 

losses), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. 
  167Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) 
 The following table presents in
formation about the principal 
balances of off-balance sheet securitized loans, including 
residential mortgages sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and 
securitizations where servicing is our only form of continuing 
involvement. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more 
past due and still accruing interest as well as nonaccrual loans. 
In securitizations where servicing is our only form of continuing 
involvement, we would only experience a loss if required to 
repurchase a delinquent loan due to a breach in representations 

and warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing 
contracts. Net charge-offs exclude loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC 
and GNMA as we do not service 
or manage the underlying real 
estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to net 

charge-off information.

(2) Revised to correct previously reported amounts. 
 In addition to the transactions 
included in the table above, at 
December 31, 2011, we had issued approximately $6.0 billion of 
private placement debt financin
g through a consolidated VIE. 
The issuance is classified as long-term debt in our consolidated 
financial statements. At Decemb
er 31, 2011, we had pledged 
approximately $6.2 billion in loans (principal and interest 
eligible to be capitalized), $316 million in securities available for 
sale and $154 million in ca
sh and cash equivalents to 
collateralize the VIE™s borrowings. Such assets were not 
transferred to the VIE and accord
ingly we have excluded the VIE 
from the previous table. 
 We have raised financing throug
h the securitization of certain 
financial assets in transactions
 with VIEs accounted for as 
secured borrowings. We also cons
olidate VIEs where we are the 
primary beneficiary. In certain transactions other than the 

multi-seller commercial paper conduit, we provide contractual 
support in the form of limited recourse and liquidity to facilitate 
the remarketing of short-term se
curities issued to third party 
169Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 
(continued) 
 investors. Other than this limite
d contractual support, the assets 
of the VIEs are the sole source 
of repayment of the securities 
held by third parties. The liqu
idity support we provide to the 
multi-seller commercial paper conduit ensures timely repayment 
of commercial paper issued by
 the conduit and is described 
further below. 

 NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN 
SECURITIZATIONS  
We have consolidated certain of our 
nonconforming residential mortga
ge loan securitizations in 
accordance with consolidation 
accounting guidance. We have 
determined we are the primary beneficiary of these 
securitizations because we have 
the power to direct the most 
significant activities of the enti
ty through our role as primary 
servicer and also hold variable interests that we have determined 

to be significant. The nature of
 our variable interests in these 
entities may include beneficial interests issued by the VIE, 
mortgage servicing rights and recourse or repurchase reserve 
liabilities. The beneficial interests issued by the VIE that we hold 
include either subordinate or senior securities held in an amount 
that we consider potentially significant. 

 MULTI-SELLER COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT
  We administer 
a multi-seller asset-based commercial paper conduit that 

finances certain client transactions. This conduit is a bankruptcy 
remote entity that makes loans to, or purchases certificated 
interests, generally from SPEs, established by our clients 

(sellers) and which are secured by pools of financial assets. The 

conduit funds itself through th
e issuance of highly rated 
commercial paper to third party in
vestors. The primary source of 
repayment of the commercial pape
r is the cash flows from the 
conduit™s assets or the re
-issuance of commercial paper upon 
maturity. The conduit™s ass
ets are structured with deal-specific 
credit enhancements generally in the form of 
overcollateralization provided by the seller, but may also include 
subordinated interests, cash rese
rve accounts, third party credit 

support facilities and excess 
spread capture. The timely 
repayment of the commercial paper is further supported by 

asset-specific liquidity facilities in the form of liquidity asset 

purchase agreements that we provide. Each facility is equal to 
102% of the conduit™s funding commitment to a clien
t. The 
aggregate amount of liquidity must be equal to or greater than 
all the commercial paper issued by
 the conduit. At the discretion 
of the administrator, we may be required to purchase assets 
from the conduit at par value plus accrued interest or discount 
on the related commercial paper,
 including situations where the 
conduit is unable to issue commercial paper. Par value may be 

different from fair value.  

  We receive fees in connection with our role as administrator 
and liquidity provider. We may also receive fees related to the 
structuring of the conduit™s tran
sactions. In 2010, the conduit 
terminated its subordinated note to a third party investor and 
repaid all amounts due under the 
terms of the note agreement. 
We are the primary beneficiary of
 the conduit because we have 
power over the significant activities of the conduit and have a 

significant variable interest du
e to our liquidity arrangement. 
 INVESTMENT FUNDS  
We have consolidated certain of our 
investment funds where we manage
 the assets of the fund and 
our interests absorb a majority of the funds™ variability. In 2011, 

we redeemed our interest in an unconsolidated investment fund 

and placed the assets received 
upon redemption into new VIEs. 
We consolidate these VIEs becaus
e we have discretion over the 
management of the assets and ar
e the sole investor in these 
funds.
 170  Note 9: Mortgage Banking Activities 
 Mortgage banking activities, included in the Community 
Banking and Wholesale Banking operating segments, consist of 
residential and commercial mortgage loan origination, sale 
activity and servicing.  
 We apply fair value method to substantially all of our 
residential MSRs and apply the amortization method to all 
commercial and some residential MSRs. The changes in MSRs 
measured using the fair value method were:

by interest rate stratifications. A valuation allowance of $37 m
illion and $3 million was recorded on the 
residential amortized MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

 172  The following table summarizes th
e changes in our liability for 
mortgage loan repurchase losses. 
This liability is in ﬁAccrued 
expenses and other liabilitiesﬂ in our consolidated financi
al statements and the provision for repurchase losses reduces net 
gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities. Because the 
level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic 
factors, investor demand strategies and other external 

conditions that may change over 
the life of the underlying loans, 
the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is 

difficult to estimate and requires considerable management 

judgment. We maintain regular contact with the GSEs and other 
significant investors to monitor and address their repurchase 
demand practices and concerns. Be
cause of the uncertainty in 
the various estimates underlying the mortgage repurchase 
liability, there is a range of losses in excess of the recorded 
mortgage repurchase liability that are reasonably possible. The 

estimate of the range of possib
le loss for representations and 
warranties does not represent a probable loss, and is based on 

currently available information,
 significant judgment, and a 
number of assumptions that are 
subject to change. The high end 
of this range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our 
recorded liability was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, and was 
determined based upon modifying the assumptions utilized in 
our best estimate of probable loss 
to reflect what we believe to be 
the high end of reasonably possible adverse assumptions.

goodwill to the individual operating segments. We identify 

reporting units that are one level below an operating segment 
(referred to as a component), and distinguish these reporting 
units based on how the segments
 and components are managed, 
taking into consideration the econ
omic characteristics, nature of 
the products and customers of the components. We allocate 
goodwill to reporting units based on relative fair value, using 
certain performance metrics. See Note 24 for further 

information on management reporting. 
 The following table shows the allocation of goodwill to our 
operating segments for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. 
The reduction in 2010 was pred
ominately due to reversals of

 176  Note 13: Long-Term Debt 
 As a part of our overall interest
 rate risk management strategy, 
we often use derivatives to manage interest rate risk. As a result, 
much of the long-term debt presen
ted below is hedged in a fair 
value or cash flow hedge relationship. See Note 16 for further 
information on qualifying hedge contracts. 

  Following is a summary of our long-term debt, reflecting 
unamortized debt discounts and premiums, and purchase

(1) On March 30, 2009, Wells Fargo issued $1.75 billion of 2.125% fixed senior unsecured notes and $1.75 billion of floating senior
 unsecured notes both maturing on 
June 15, 
2012. These notes are guaranteed under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation™s (FDIC) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Progr
am (TLGP) and are backed by the 
full faith and credit of the United States. 
(2) Primarily consists of long-term notes where the performance of the note is linked to an embedded equity, commodity, or currency
 index, or basket of indices accounted for 
separately from the note as a free-standing derivative. 
For information on embedded derivatives, see Note 16 
Œ Free-standing derivatives. 
(3) Represents junior subordinated debentures held by unconsolidated
 wholly owned trusts formed for the sole purpose of issuing tru
st preferred securities. See Note 8 for 
additional information on our trust preferred security structures. 
  We participated in the FDIC™s Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee Program (TLGP). The 
TLGP had two components: the 
Debt Guarantee Program, which provided a temporary 
guarantee of newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by 
eligible entities; and the Transaction Account Guarantee 
Program, which provided a temporary unlimited guarantee of 

funds in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC-
insured institutions. We opted out of the TLGP effective 
January 1, 2010. 

 The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt 
obligations (based on final maturity dates) as of 
December 31, 2011, are presen

 The interest rates on floating-rate notes are determined 
periodically by formulas based on certain money market rates, 

subject, on certain notes, to minimum or maximum interest 
rates. 
 As part of our long-term and short-term borrowing 
arrangements, we are subject to various financial and 

operational covenants. Some of
 the agreements under which 
debt has been issued have provis
ions that may limit the merger 
or sale of certain subsidiary banks and the issuance of capital 

stock or convertible securities by certain subsidiary banks. At 
December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all the 
covenants. 
178  Note 14: Guarantees, Pled
ged Assets and Collateral 
 Guarantees are contracts that co
ntingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party ba
sed on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, 
rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities 

lending and other indemnifications, liquidity agreements, 
written put options, recourse obligations, residual value 
guarantees, and contingent consideration. The following table 
shows carrying value, maximum exposure to loss on our 
guarantees and the amount with a higher risk of performance.

(1) We commenced divestiture of our securities lending business in the latter half of 2011. 
(2) Certain of these agreements included in this table are related to off-balance sheet entities and, accordingly, are also disclos
ed in Note 8. 
(3) Written put options, which are in the form of derivatives, are also included in the derivative disclosures in Note 16. 
 ﬁMaximum exposure to lossﬂ and ﬁNon
-investment gradeﬂ are 
required disclosures under GAAP. Non-investment grade 

represents those guarantees on wh
ich we have a higher risk of 
being required to perform under 
the terms of the guarantee. If 
the underlying assets under th
e guarantee are non-investment 
grade (that is, an external rating that is below investment grade 
or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent to a below 
investment grade external rating
), we consider the risk of 
performance to be high. Internal credit default grades are 

determined based upon the same cr
edit policies that we use to 
evaluate the risk of payment or performance when making loans 
and other extensions of credit. These credit policies are further 
described in Note 6. 

 Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that 
would be incurred under an assu
med hypothetical circumstance, 
despite what we believ
e is its extremely remote possibility, where 
the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines 

to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any 
economic hedges. Accordingly, this required disclosure is not an 

indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value, which 
is either fair value for derivative related products or the 
allowance for lending related commitments, is more 
representative of our exposure to loss than maximum exposure 
to loss.  

 STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
  We issue standby letters of 
credit, which include performance and financial guarantees, for 
customers in connection with co
ntracts between our customers 
and third parties. Standby letters of credit are agreements where 
we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a 
customer in the event the customer fails to meet their 

contractual obligations. We consid
er the credit risk in standby 
letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit in 

determining the allowance for credit losses.  
 SECURITIES LENDING AND OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS
  As a securities lending agent, we lend securities from participating 

institutional clients
™ portfolios to third-party borrowers. We 
indemnify our clients against 
default by the borrower in 
returning these lent securities. 
This indemnity is supported by 
collateral received from the borrowers. Collateral is generally in 
the form of cash or highly liqu
id securities that are marked to 
market daily. There was $687 million at December 31, 2011, and 
$14.0 billion at December 31, 2010, in collateral supporting 
loaned securities with values of $669 million and $13.6 billion, 

respectively. 
 We enter into other types of 
indemnification agreements in 
the ordinary course of business under which we agree to 
indemnify third parties agains
t any damages, losses and 
expenses incurred in connection with legal and other 

proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with us. 

These relationships or transactio
ns include those arising from 
service as a director or officer of the Company, underwriting 

agreements relating to our securities, acquisition agreements 
and various other business transactions or arrangements. 
Because the extent of our obli
gations under these agreements 
depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, we are 
unable to determine our potential future liability under these 
agreements. We do, however, record a liability for residential 
mortgage loans that we may have
 to repurchase pursuant to 
various representations and warranties. See Note 1 and Note 9 
for additional information on the liability for mortgage loan 
repurchase losses. 

 179Note 14:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets, and Collateral 
(continued) 
 LIQUIDITY AGREEMENTS
  We provide liquidity facilities on all 
commercial paper issued by the conduit we administer. We also 
provide liquidity to certain off-balance sheet entities that hold 
securitized fixed-rate municipal bonds and consumer or 
commercial assets that 
are partially funded wi
th the issuance of 
money market and other short-term notes. See Note 8 for 

additional information 
on these arrangements. 
 WRITTEN PUT OPTIONS
  Written put options are contracts that 
give the counterparty the right to sell to us an underlying 

instrument held by the counterparty at a specified price, and 
include options, floors, caps and credit default swaps. These 
written put option contracts generally permit net settlement. 

While these derivative transactions 
expose us to risk in the event 
the option is exercised, we mana
ge this risk by entering into 
offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the underlying 

instrument. We offset substantia
lly all put options written to 
customers with purchased options. Additionally, for certain of 

these contracts, we require th
e counterparty to pledge the 
underlying instrument as colla
teral for the transaction. Our 
ultimate obligation under written put options is based on future 

market conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. See 
Note 8 for additional informatio
n regarding transactions with 
VIEs and Note 16 for additional
 information regarding written 
derivative contracts.  

 LOANS AND MHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE
  In certain loan sales 
or securitizations, we provide re
course to the buyer whereby we 
are required to indemnify the b
uyer for any loss on the loan up 

to par value plus accrued interest. We provide recourse, 
predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various 

programs and arrangements. Primar
ily all of these programs and 
arrangements require that we shar
e in the loans™ credit exposure 
for their remaining life by provid
ing recourse to the GSE, up to 
33.33% of actual losses incurred on 
a pro-rata basis, in the event 

of borrower default. Under the remaining recourse programs 

and arrangements, if certain ev
ents occur within a specified 
period of time from transfer date, we have to provide limited 

recourse to the buyer to indemn
ify them for losses incurred for 
the remaining life of the loans. The maximum exposure to loss 
reported in the accompanying ta
ble represents the outstanding 
principal balance of the loans sold
 or securitized that are subject 
to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the 

contractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of 

loss of the entire balance due to
 these recourse agreements is 
remote and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part 
from the sale of collateral. In 2011, we repurchased $38 million 
of loans associated with these agreements. We also provide 

representation and warranty guarantees on loans sold under the 
various recourse programs and arrangements. Our loss exposure 
relative to these guarantees 
is separately considered and 
provided for, as necessary, in 
determination of our liability for 
loan repurchases due to breaches of representation and 
warranties. See Note 9 for additional information on the liability 
for mortgage loan repurchase losses.  
 RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES
  We have provided residual 
value guarantees as part of certain leasing transactions of 
corporate assets. At December 
31, 2011, the only remaining 
residual value guarantee is relate
d to a leasing transaction on 
certain corporate buildings. The lessors in these leases are 
generally large financial institutions or their leasing subsidiaries. 
These guarantees protect the less
or from loss on sale of the 
related asset at the end of the le
ase term. To the extent that a 
sale of the leased assets result
s in proceeds less than a stated 
percent (generally 80% to 89%) of the asset™s cost, we would be 
required to reimburse the lessor under our guarantee. 
 CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
  In connection with certain 
brokerage, asset management, insurance agency and other 

acquisitions we have made, the terms of the acquisition 

agreements provide for deferred payments or additional 
consideration, based on certain performance targets.  
 We have entered into various contingent performance 

guarantees through credit risk
 participation arrangements. 
Under these agreements, if a custom
er defaults on its obligation 
to perform under certain credit agreements with third parties, 
we will be required to make pa
yments to the third parties. 
 Pledged Assets and Collateral 
As part of our liquidity managemen
t strategy, we pledge assets to 
secure trust and public deposits, borrowings from the FHLB and 
FRB and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. The 
following table provides pledged loans and securities available 
for sale where the secured party does
 not have the right to sell or 
repledge the collateral. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did 

not pledge any loans or securities available for sale where the 
secured party has the right to sell
 or repledge the collateral. The 
table excludes pledged assets related to VIEs, which can only be 
used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 8 for 
additional information on consolidated VIE assets.

financings. The types of collateral we pledge include securities 
issued by federal agencies, government-sponsored entities 

(GSEs), and domestic and foreign companies. We pledged 
$20.8 billion at December 31, 2011, and $27.3 billion at 
December 31, 2010, under agreem
ents that permit the secured 
parties to sell or repledge the collateral. Pledged collateral where 

the secured party cannot sell or repledge was $2.8 billion and 

$5.9 billion at the same 
period ends, respectively. 
 We receive collateral from other entities under resale 

agreements and securities borrowings. We received $17.8 billion 

at December 31, 2011, and $22.5 
billion at December 31, 2010, 
for which we have the right to sell or repledge the collateral. 
These amounts include securities we have sold or repledged to 

others with a fair value of $16.7 billion at December 31, 2011, 

and $14.6 billion at December 31, 2010. 
180  Note 15: Legal Actions 
 Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a 
number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business 
activities. These proceedings include actions brought against 
Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate 

related matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or 
our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our 
subsidiaries may be requested to provide information or 

otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct 
of investigations of other persons or industry groups.  
 Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate 

outcome, Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries have generally 
denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, 
liability in all significant litigation pending against us, including 

the matters described below, and we intend to defend 
vigorously each case, other than matters we describe as having 
settled. Reserves are established for legal claims when 
payments associated with the claims become probable and the 
costs can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving 

legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the 
amounts reserved for those claims. 
 ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL LITIGATION  
On July 31, 2009, the 
Attorney General for the State of Illinois filed a civil lawsuit 

against Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and 

Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. in the Circuit Court for Cook 

County, Illinois. The Illinois At
torney General alleges that the 
Wells Fargo defendants engaged in illegal discrimination by 

ﬁreverse redliningﬂ and by steeri
ng African-American and Latino 
customers into high cost, subprime mortgage loans while other 

borrowers with similar incomes received lower cost mortgages. 

Illinois also alleges that Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. 
misled Illinois customers about the terms of mortgage loans. 
Illinois™ complaint against all Wells Fargo defendants is based on
 alleged violation of the Illino
is Human Rights Act and the 
Illinois Fairness in Lending Act. 
The complaint also alleges that 
Wells Fargo Financial Illinois, Inc. violated the Illinois 

Consumer Fraud and Deceptive 
Business Practices Act and the 
Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Illinois™ 

complaint seeks an injunction against the defendants™ alleged 

violation of these Illinois statut
es, restitution to consumers and 
civil money penalties. On October 26, 2011, the Illinois Court 

issued an order granting, in part, and denying, in part, Wells 

Fargo™s motion to dismiss. 
The Court dismissed Wells Fargo & 
Company as a party and dismissed Count III of the complaint, 

which alleged violations of the Illinois Fair Lending Act. The 

Court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. 
 INTERCHANGE LITIGATION
  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells 
Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wachovia 

Corporation are named as defendants, separately or in 
combination, in putative class actions filed on behalf of a 
plaintiff class of merchants and in individual actions brought by 
individual merchants with regard to the interchange fees 
associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. 

These actions have been consol
idated in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Visa, 
MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies are 
named as defendants in various of these actions. The amended 
and consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants 
based on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws 

and seeks damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff 
merchants allege that Visa, MasterCard and payment card 
issuing banks unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates. 

Plaintiffs also allege that en
forcement of certain Visa and 
MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services 

offered to merchants are anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and 

Wachovia, along with other defendants and entities, are parties 
to Loss and Judgment Sharing Agreements, which provide that 
they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in 

any losses from the Interchange Litigation.
   MEDICAL CAPITAL CORPORATION LITIGATION
  Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. served as indentur
e trustee for debt issued by 
affiliates of Medical Capital Corporation, which was placed in 
receivership at the request of
 the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) in August 2009. Since September 2009, 

Wells Fargo has been named as a defendant in various class and 

mass actions brought by ho
lders of Medical Capital 
Corporation™s debt, alleging that Wells Fargo breached 

contractual and other legal obligations owed to them and seeking 

unspecified damages. The actions have been consolidated in the 

United States District Court for the Central District of California. 
On July 26, 2011, the District Court certified a class consisting of 
holders of notes issued by affiliates of Medical Capital 
Corporation and, on October 18, 
2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals denied a petition seeking 
to appeal the class certification 
order. 
 MORTGAGE-BACKED CERTIFICATES LITIGATION
  Several 
securities law based putative class actions were consolidated in 

the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on 
July 16, 2009, under the caption 
In re Wells Fargo Mortgage-
Backed Certificates Litigation
. The case asserted claims against 
several Wells Fargo mortgage backed securities trusts, Wells 

Fargo Bank, N.A. and other affiliated entities, individual 

employee defendants, along wi
th various underwriters and 
rating agencies. The plaintiffs alleged that the offering 

documents contain untrue statements of material fact, or omit to 

state material facts necessary to make the registration 
statements and accompanying prospectuses not misleading. The 
parties agreed to settle the case on May 27, 2011, for 

$125 million. Final approval of the settlement was entered on 
November 14, 2011. Some class members opted out of the 
settlement, with the most significant being the Federal National 

Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and American 
International Group, Inc. 
 On June 29, 2010, and on July
 15, 2010, two complaints, the 
first captioned 
The Charles Schwab Corporation vs. Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., et al., 
and the second 
captioned The Charles Schwab Corporation v. BNP Paribas 
181Note 15:  Legal Actions 
(continued) 
 Securities Corp., et al., 
were filed in the Superior Court for the 
State of California, San Francisco County against a number of 
defendants, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo 
Asset Securities Corporation. As against the Wells Fargo entities, 
the new cases assert opt out claims relating to the claims alleged 
in the Mortgage-Backed Certificates Litigation. 
 On October 15, 2010, th
ree actions, captioned 
Federal Home 
Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of America Funding 
Corporation, et al. 
(filed in the Cook County Circuit Court, State 
of Illinois); 
Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Banc of 
America Securities LLC, et al. 
(filed in the Superior Court of the 

State of California for the County of Los Angeles); and 
Federal 
Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis
 v. Banc of America Mortgage 
America Securities, Inc., et al. 
(filed in the Superior Court of the 
State of Indiana for the County of Marion), named multiple 
defendants, described as issuers/depositors, and 

underwriters/dealers of pr
ivate label mortgage-backed 
securities, in an action asserting claims that defendants used 

false and misleading statements 
in offering documents for the 
sale of such securities. The Bank of Chicago asserts that it 

purchased approximately $4.2 billion and the Bank of 

Indianapolis asserts that it purchased nearly $3 billion of such 
securities from the defendants. Pl
aintiffs seek rescission of the 
sales and damages under state securities and other laws and 
Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933. Wells Fargo Asset 
Securities Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo 
& Company were named among the defendants. 

 On April 20, 2011, a case captioned 
Federal Home Loan of 
Boston v. Ally Financial, Inc., et al.
, was filed in the Superior 
Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the County of 

Suffolk. The case names, among a large number of parties, 

Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo Asset Securitization 
Corporation and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as parties and contains 
allegations substantially similar 
to the cases filed by the other 
Federal Home Loan Banks. 

 On April 28, 2011, a case captioned 
The Union Central Life 
Insurance Company, et al. v. Credit Suisse First Boston 
Securities Corp., et al., 
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of New York. Among other defendants, it 
names Wells Fargo Asset Securitization Corporation and 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The case asserts various state law fraud 
claims and claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of 

the Securities Exchange Act of 19
34 on behalf of three insurance 
companies, relating to offerings of mortgage-backed securities 
from 2005 through 2007. 
 In addition, there are other mortgage-related threatened or 
asserted claims by entities or investors where Wells Fargo may 
have indemnity or repurchase obli
gations, or as to which it has 
entered into agreements to toll the relevant statutes of 
limitations. 
 MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE DOCUMENT
 LITIGATION
  Eight purported class actions and several individual borrower actions 
related to foreclosure document pr
actices were filed in late 2010 
and in early 2011 against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in its status as 
mortgage servicer or corporate trustee of mortgage trusts. The 
cases have been brought in state and federal courts. Five of
 the 
class actions have been dismissed or otherwise resolved.
 Of the 
individual borrower cases, the major
ity are filed in state courts 
in California and Ohio. The actions generally claim that Wells 
Fargo submitted "fraudulent" or "untruthful" affidavits or other 
foreclosure documents to courts to support foreclosures filed in 
the state. Specifically, plaintiffs
 allege that Wells Fargo signers 
did not have personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the 

documents and did not verify th
e information in the documents 
ultimately filed with courts to foreclose. Plaintiffs attempt to 
state legal claims ranging from wrongful foreclosure to deceptive 
practices or fraud and seek relief ranging from cancellation of 

notes and mortgages to money damages. 
 MORTGAGE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS
  On April 13, 2011, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a Consent 

Order with the OCC and Wells Fargo & Company entered into a 
Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System in connect
ion with Wells Fargo™s m
ortgage 
foreclosure practices. The Consent Orders require Wells Fargo to 

develop and implement certain compliance programs and to take 
other remedial steps, which Wells Fargo is doing. On 
February 9, 2012, the OCC and Federal Reserve announced that 

they had also imposed civil mone
y penalties of $83 million and 
$85 million, respectively, relate
d to the Consent Orders. These 
penalties will be satisfied 
through payments made under a 
separate simultaneous settlement in principle, announced on the 
same day, among the Department 
of Justice (DOJ), a task force 
of Attorneys General from 49 states, other government entities, 
Wells Fargo and four other mortgage servicers related to 

mortgage servicing and forecl
osure practices. Under the 
settlement in principle, Wells Fargo agreed to the following 
commitments, comprised of three components totaling 

$5.3 billion: 
 Consumer Relief Program
  For qualified borrowers with 
financial hardship and a loan 
owned and serviced by Wells 
Fargo, a commitment to provide $3.4 billion in aggregate 
consumer relief and assistance programs, including 

expanded first and second mortgage modifications that 
broaden the use of principal reduction to help customers 
achieve affordability, an expanded short sale program that 

includes waivers of deficiency balances, forgiveness of 
arrearages for unemployed borrowers, cash-for-keys 
payments to borrowers who voluntarily vacate properties, 

and ﬁanti-blightﬂ pro
visions designed to reduce the impact 
on communities of vacant properties. As of 
December 31, 2011, the expect
ed impact of the Consumer 
Relief Program was covered in our allowance for credit 
losses and in the nonaccretable
 difference relating to our 
purchased credit-impaired residential mortgage portfolio. 
 Refinance Program
  For qualified borrowers with little or 
negative equity in their home and a loan owned and serviced 
by Wells Fargo, an expanded first-lien refinance program 

commitment estimated to provide $900 million of aggregate 
payment relief over the life of the refinanced loans. The 
Refinance Program will not result in any current-period 
charge as its impact will be recognized over a period of years 
in the form of lower interest 
income as qualified borrowers 
benefit from reduced interest rates on loans refinanced 
under the program. 
182   Foreclosure Assistance Payment
  $1 billion paid 
directly to the federal gove
rnment and the participating 
states for their use to address the impact of foreclosure 
challenges as they see fit and which may include direct 
payments to consumers. As of
 December 31, 2011, we had 
fully accrued for the Forecl
osure Assistance Payment. 
    
Government agencies continue investigations or examinations of 
other mortgage related practices of Wells Fargo. The 
investigations relate to two main
 topics, (1) whether Wells Fargo 
may have violated fair lending or other laws and regulations 
relating to mortgage origination 
practices; and (2) whether Wells 
Fargo properly disclosed in offeri
ng documents for its residential 
mortgage-backed securities the facts and risks associated with 

those securities. Wells Fargo has received a Wells notice from 
SEC staff relating to Wells Fargo™s disclosures in mortgage
-backed securities offering docu
ments. Wells Fargo continues to 
provide information requested by the various agencies in 

connection with certain investigations. 
 MUNICIPAL DERIVATIVES BID PRACTICES INVESTIGATION
  The DOJ and the SEC, beginning in November 2006, requested 

information from a number of financial institutions, including 
Wachovia Bank, N.A.™s municipal 
derivatives group, with regard 
to competitive bid practices in 
the municipal derivative markets. 
Other state and federal agencies subsequently also began 

investigations of the same prac
tices. On December 8, 2011, a 
global resolution of the Wach
ovia Bank investigations was 
announced by DOJ, the Internal 
Revenue Service, the SEC, the 
OCC and a group of State Attorney
s General. The investigations 
were settled with Wachovia Bank
 agreeing to pay a total of 
approximately $148 million in penalties and remediation to the 
various agencies. 
 Wachovia Bank, along with a number of other banks and 
financial services companies, was named as a defendant in a 
number of substantially identi
cal purported class actions and 
individual actions filed in various state and federal courts by 
various municipalities alleging 
they have been damaged by the 
activity which is the subject of the government investigations. 
These cases were either consolidated under the caption 
In re 
Municipal Derivatives Antitrust Litigation
 or administered 
jointly with that action in th
e U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs and Wells Fargo 
agreed to settle the 
In re Municipal Derivatives Antitrust 
Litigation
 on October 21, 2011. The settlement is subject to court 
approval and, if finally approved, will result in Wells Fargo 
paying the amount of $37 million. The settlement was 
preliminarily approved on December 27, 2011.
  ORDER OF POSTING LITIGATION
  A series of putative class 
actions have been filed against Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wells 

Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as many other banks, challenging the 
high to low order in which the Banks post debit card transactions 
to consumer deposit accounts. There are currently several such 
cases pending against Wells Fargo Bank (including the Wachovia 
Bank cases to which Wells Fargo succeeded), most of which have 
been consolidated in multi-district litigation proceedings in the 

U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The bank 
defendants moved to compel th
ese cases to arbitration under 
recent Supreme Court authority. On November 22, 2011, the 
Judge denied the motion. The Bank
s have appealed the decision 
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 On August 10, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of California issued an order in 
Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A., a case that was not consoli
dated in the multi-district 
proceedings, enjoining the Bank™s use of the high to low posti
ng method for debit card transactions
 with respect to the plaintiff 
class of California depositors, di
recting that the Bank establish a 
different posting methodology and ordering remediation of 

approximately $203 million. On October 26, 2010, a final 
judgment was entered in Gutierrez. On October 28, 2010, Wells 

Fargo appealed to th
e U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
 WACHOVIA EQUITY SECURITIES AND BONDS/NOTES LITIGATION
  A securities class action, now captioned 
In re Wachovia Equity 
Securities Litigation,
 has been pending under various names 
since July 7, 2008, in the U.S.
 District Court for the Southern 
District of New York alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 
20(a) of the Securities Exchan
ge Act of 1934. Among other 
allegations, plaintiffs 
allege Wachovia™s common stock price was 
artificially inflated as a result of allegedly misleading disclosures 

relating to the Golden West Financial Corp. mortgage portfolio, 
Wachovia™s exposure to other mortgage related products such as 
CDOs, control issues and auction 
rate securities. There are four 
additional cases (not class actions) containing allegations similar 

to the allegations in the 
In re Wachovia Equity Securities 
Litigation 
captioned 
Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Wachovia 
Corp. et al., FC Holdings AB, et al. v. Wachovia Corp., et al., 

Deka Investment GmbH v. Wachovia Corp. et al. and Forsta 
AP-Fonden v. Wachovia Corp., et al.
, respectively, which were 
filed in the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New 
York. On March 31, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of New York entered a Decision and Order granting 

Wachovia™s motions to dismiss the 
In re Wachovia Equity 
Securities Litigation
 and the 
Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, FC 
Holdings AB, Deka Investment GmbH 
and Forsta AP-Fonden
 cases. Plaintiffs and Wells Fargo have agreed to settle the 
Equity 
Securities Litigation 
for $75 million and on January 27, 2012, 
the Court entered an order 
preliminarily approving the 
settlement. A fairness hearing on 
final approval of the settlement 
is scheduled for June 1, 2012. 
 After a number of procedural motions, three purported class 
action cases alleging violations of
 Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the 
Securities Act of 1933 as a result of allegedly misleading 

disclosures relating to the Golden West mortgage portfolio in 

connection with Wachovia™s issuance of various preferred 
securities and bonds were transfer
red to the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of Ne
w York. A consolidated class 
action complaint was filed on September 4, 2009, and the matter 

was captioned In Re Wachovia Pref
erred Securities and 
Bond/Notes Litigation
. On March 31, 2011, by the same Decision 
and Order referenced above, the court also granted in part and 

denied in part Wachovia™s
 motion to dismiss the 
In re Wachovia 
Preferred Securities an
d Bond/Notes Litigation
, allowing that 
case to go forward after limiting 
the number of offerings at issue. 
183Note 15:  Legal Actions 
(continued) 
 Wells Fargo and the plaintiffs agreed to settle the 
In re 
Wachovia Preferred 
Securities and Bond/Notes Litigation
 for 
$590 million. The proposed settlement was preliminarily 
approved by the Court on
 August 9, 2011. The hearing on final 
approval
 was held on November 14, 2011, and a judgment 
approving class action settlements
 was filed on January 3, 2012. 
 There are a number of other similar actions filed in state 

courts in North Carolina and South Carolina by individual 
shareholders. Two of the individua
l shareholder actions in South 
Carolina have been dismisse
d and the shareholders have 
appealed. On December 22, 
2011, the dismissal of the 
Rivers v. 
Wachovia Corporation, et al.
 case, one of the two South 
Carolina actions, was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Fourth Circuit.
  OUTLOOK
  When establishing a liability for contingent litigation 
losses, the Company determines a 
range of potential losses for 
each matter that is both probable
 and estimable, and records the 
amount it considers to be the be
st estimate within the range. 
The high end of the range of reasonably possible potential 
litigation losses in excess 
of the Company™s 
liability for probable 
and estimable losses was $1.2 billi
on as of December 31, 2011. 
For these matters and others wh
ere an unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of 
possible losses in excess of the established liability that cannot 
be estimated. Based on informatio
n currently available, advice of 
counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, 
Wells Fargo believes that the 
eventual outcome of the actions 
against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries, including the 

matters described above, will not, individually or in the 

aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo™s 
consolidated financial position
. However, in the event of 
unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate 
resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to 
Wells Fargo™s results of operations for any particular period.
  Note 16: Derivatives  We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, interest 
rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, to generate profits 
from proprietary trading and to as
sist customers with their risk 
management objectives. Derivative 
transactions are measured in 
terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded 

on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a 
meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The 

notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as 
the basis on which interest and 
other payments are determined. 
 Our asset/liability management 
approach to interest rate, 
foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of 
derivatives. Such derivatives ar
e typically designated as fair 
value or cash flow hedges, or economic hedge derivatives for 
those that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting. This helps 
minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair 
values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest 

rate, foreign currency and other market value volatility. This 
approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of 
certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, 

foreign currency and other exposures do not have a significantly 
adverse effect on the net inte
rest margin, cash flows and 
earnings. As a result of fluctuations in these exposures, hedged 
assets and liabilities will gain or lose market value. In a fair value 
or economic hedge, the effect of 
this unrealized gain or loss will 
generally be offset by the gain or
 loss on the derivatives linked to 
the hedged assets and liabilities. In a cash flow hedge, where we 
manage the variability of cash payments due to interest rate 

fluctuations by the effective use of
 derivatives linked to hedged 
assets and liabilities, the unrealized gain or loss on the 
derivatives or the hedged asset or liability is generally not 
reflected in earnings. 
  We also offer various derivatives, including interest rate, 
commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, to our 

customers but usually offset our exposure from such contracts by 
purchasing other financial contracts. The customer 

accommodations and any offsetting financial contracts are 
treated as free-standing derivati
ves. Free-standing derivatives 
also include derivatives we ente
r into for risk management that 
do not otherwise qualify for 
hedge accounting, including 
economic hedge derivatives. To a lesser extent, we take positions 
based on market expectations or to benefit from price 

differentials between financial instruments and markets. 
Additionally, free-standing de
rivatives include embedded 
derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately from 
their host contracts. 
 The following table presents th
e total notional or contractual 
amounts and fair values for derivatives designated as qualifying 

hedge contracts, which are used as asset/liability management 
hedges, and free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) not 
designated as hedging instrume
nts that are recorded on the 
balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities. Customer 
accommodation, trading and other free-standing derivatives are 
recorded on the balance sheet at 
fair value in trading assets or 
other liabilities.

    185Note 16:  Derivatives 
(continued) 
 Fair Value Hedges 
We use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate 
long-term debt and CDs to floating rates to hedge our exposure 
to interest rate risk. We also 
enter into cross-currency swaps, 
cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to 
hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk 
associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated 
long-term debt. In addition, we use interest rate swaps and 

forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of 
certain investments in available-for-sale debt securities due to 
changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. We also 

use interest rate swaps to hedge 
against changes in fair value for 
certain mortgages held for sale. The entire derivative gain or loss 
is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair 

value hedge relationships, except for those involving foreign-
currency denominated securities available for sale and long-term 
debt hedged with foreign currency forward derivatives for which 
the component of the derivative 
gain or loss related to the 
changes in the difference between 
the spot and forward price is 
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 We use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge 
effectiveness, both at inception 
of the hedging relationship and 
on an ongoing basis. The regressi
on analysis involves regressing 
the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument 

against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability 
being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The 
assessment includes an evaluation
 of the quantitative measures 
of the regression results used to 
validate the conclusion of high 
effectiveness.

edge effectiveness (time value). 
186  Cash Flow Hedges 
We hedge floating-rate debt against future interest rate increases 
by using interest rate swaps, 
caps, floors and futures to limit 
variability of cash flows due 
to changes in the benchmark 
interest rate. We also use intere
st rate swaps and floors to hedge 
the variability in interest paymen
ts received on certain floating-
rate commercial loans, due to ch
anges in the benchmark interest 
rate. Gains and losses on derivatives that are reclassified from 
OCI to interest income and in
terest expense in the current 
period are included in the line 
item in which the hedged item™s 
effect on earnings is recorded. All parts of gain or loss on these 

derivatives are included in the asse
ssment of hedge effectiveness. 
We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at 

inception of the hedging relation
ship and on an ongoing basis. 
The regression analysis involves 
regressing the periodic changes 
in cash flows of the hedging instrument against the periodic 
changes in cash flows of the fore
casted transaction being hedged 
due to changes in the hedged risk
(s). The assessment includes an 
evaluation of the quantitative me
asures of the regression results 
used to validate the conclusi
on of high effectiveness. 
 Based upon current interest rates, we estimate that 
$440 million (pre-tax) of deferred net gains on derivatives in 
OCI at December 31, 2011, will 
be reclassified into interest 
income and interest expense during the next twelve months. 
Future changes to interest rates may significantly change actual 
amounts reclassified to earnings
. We are hedging our exposure 
to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted 
transactions for a maximum of 6 years for both hedges of 
floating-rate debt and floating-rate commercial loans.

related to derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships.

Free-Standing Derivatives 
We use free-standing derivatives (economic hedges), in addition 
to debt securities available for sale, to hedge the risk of changes 
in the fair value of residential 
MSRs measured at fair value, 
certain residential MHFS, derivative loan commitments and 
other interests held. The resulting gain or loss on these economic 
hedges is reflected in other income. 
 The derivatives used to hedge 
these MSRs measured at fair 
value, which include swaps, 
swaptions, constant maturity 
mortgages, forwards, Eurodollar and Treasury futures and 

options contracts, resulted in net derivative gains of $5.2 billion 
in 2011 and net derivative gains of $4.5 billion in of 2010, which 
are included in mortgage banking noninterest income. The 

aggregate fair value of these derivatives was a net asset of 
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2011, and a net liability of 
$943 million at December 31, 2010. Changes in fair value of debt 

securities available for sale (unr
ealized gains and losses) are not 
included in servicing income, but 
are reported in cumulative OCI 
(net of tax) or, upon sale, are reported in net gains (losses) on 

debt securities available for sale. 
 Interest rate lock commitments for residential mortgage 
loans that we intend to sell
 are considered free-standing 
derivatives. Our interest rate ex
posure on these derivative loan 
commitments, as well as substantially all residential MHFS, is 

hedged with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) such as 
swaps, forwards and options, Eurodollar futures and options, 
and Treasury futures, forwards and options contracts. The 
commitments, free-standing derivatives and residential MHFS 
are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in 
mortgage banking noninterest income. For the fair value 
measurement of interest rate lo
ck commitments we include, at 

inception and during the life 
of the loan commitment, the 
expected net future cash flows rela
ted to the associated servicing 
of the loan. Fair valu
e changes subsequent to
 inception are based 
on changes in fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the 

exercise of the commitment and ch
anges in the probability that 
the loan will not fund within the terms of the commitment 
(referred to as a fall-out factor). 
The value of the underlying loan 
is affected primarily by changes 
in interest rates and the passage 
of time. However, changes in investor demand can also cause 
changes in the value of the underl
ying loan value that cannot be 
hedged. The aggregate fair value of derivative loan commitments 
in the balance sheet was a net asset of $478 million at 
December 31, 2011, and a net liability of $271 million at 

December 31, 
2010, and is included in the caption ﬁInterest rate 
contractsﬂ under ﬁCustomer accommodation, trading 
and other 
free-
standing derivativesﬂ in th
e first table in this Note.
  We also enter into various derivatives primarily to provide 
derivative products to customers. To a lesser extent, we take 
positions based on market expectat
ions or to benefit from price 
differentials between financial instruments and markets. These 
derivatives are not linked to specif
ic assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting 

hedge relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. We also enter into free-standing derivatives for risk 

management that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting. 
They are carried at fair value with
 changes in fair value recorded 
as other noninterest income. 
 Free-standing derivatives also
 include embedded derivatives 
that are required to be accounted for separately from their host 

contract. We periodically issue hybrid long-term notes and CDs 

where the performance of the hybr
id instrument notes is linked 
to an equity, commodity or currency index, or basket of such 

indices. These notes contain explicit terms that affect some or all 
187Note 16:  Derivatives 
(continued) 
 of the cash flows or the value of 
the note in a manner similar to a 
derivative instrument and therefor
e are considered to contain an 
ﬁembeddedﬂ derivative instrumen
t. The indices on which the 
performance of the hybrid inst
rument is calculated are not 
clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The 
ﬁembeddedﬂ derivative is separated from the host contract and 
accounted for as a free-standing 
derivative. Additionally, we may 
invest in hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives, 
such as credit derivatives, that 
are not clearly and closely related 
to the host contract. In such inst
ances, we either elect fair value 
option for the hybrid instrume
nt or separate the embedded 
derivative from the host cont
ract and account for the host 
contract and derivative separately.

 Credit Derivatives 
We use credit derivatives primarily to assist customers with their 
risk management objectives. We may also use credit derivatives 

in structured product transactions or liquidity agreements 

written to special purpose vehi
cles. The maximum exposure of 
sold credit derivatives is manag
ed through posted collateral, 
purchased credit derivatives and similar products in order to 

achieve our desired credit risk profile. This credit risk 

management provides an ability to recover a significant portion 
of any amounts that would be paid under the sold credit 
derivatives. We would be requir
ed to perform under the noted 
credit derivatives in the event of default by the referenced 

obligors. Events of default incl
ude events such as bankruptcy, 
capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest 
payment. In certain cases, other triggers may exist, such as the 
credit downgrade of the referenced obligors or the inability of 
the special purpose vehicle for which we have provided liquidity 
to obtain funding.

                               Protection sold represents the estimated maximum exposure 
to loss that would be incurred 
under an assumed hypothetical 
circumstance, where the value of our interests and any 
associated collateral declines to
 zero, without any consideration 
of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. We believe this 
hypothetical circumstance to be 
an extremely remote possibility 
and accordingly, this required disclosure is not an indication of 

expected loss. The amounts under non-investment grade 

represent the notional amounts of those credit derivatives on 
which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under 
the terms of the credit derivati
ve and are a function of the 
underlying assets.  
We consider the risk of performance to be high if the 
underlying assets under the credit
 derivative have an external 
rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit 
default grade that is equivalent
 thereto. We believe the net 
protection sold, which is representative of the net notional 
amount of protection sold and purchased with identical 
underlyings, in combination with other protection purchased, is 
more representative of our exposure to loss than either non-

investment grade or protection sold. Other protection purchased 
represents additional protection, which may offset the exposure 
to loss for protection sold, that was not purchased with an 

identical underlying of the protection sold.  
189Note 16:  Derivatives 
(continued) 
  Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
Certain of our derivative contract
s contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt, based on certain major credit rating 
agencies indicated in the relevant contracts, were to fall below 
investment grade, the counterparty could demand additional 

collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative 

instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of 

all derivative instruments with such credit-risk-related 

contingent features that are in a net liability position was 

$17.1 billion and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, 

respectively, for which we had posted $15.0 billion and 

$12.0 billion, respectively, in collateral in the normal course of 

business. If the credit-risk-related contingent features 

underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 

31, 2011 or 2010, we would have be
en required to post additional 
collateral of $2.1 billion, or $1.0 billion, respectively, or 
potentially settle the contract in
 an amount equal to its fair 
value. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk 

if counterparties to the derivati
ve contracts do not perform as 
expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty 
credit risk is equal to the amoun
t reported as a derivative asset 
on our balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset 

are derivative contracts in a ga
in position, and to the extent 
subject to master netting arrangements, net of derivatives in a 
loss position with the same co
unterparty and cash collateral 
received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through credit 
approvals, limits, monitoring 
procedures, executing master 
netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where 

appropriate. To the extent the master netting arrangements and 

other criteria meet the applicable requirements, derivatives 
balances and related cash collateral amounts are shown net in 
the balance sheet. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives 

is considered in determining fair value and our assessment of 
hedge effectiveness. 
  Note 17: Fair Values of
 Assets and Liabilities 
 We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value 
disclosures. Trading assets, securities available for sale, 

derivatives, substantially all prime residential MHFS, certain 
commercial LHFS, certain loans held for investment, fair value 
MSRs, principal investments and securities sold but not yet 

purchased (short sale liabilities) are recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis. We generally do 
not record our issued debt at 
fair value. Additionally, from time
 to time, we may be required to 
record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as 
certain residential and commercial MHFS, certain LHFS, loans 
held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring 
fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-
cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

 We adopted new guidance on fair value measurements 

effective January 1, 2009, which 
addresses measuring fair value 
in situations where markets are in
active and transactions are not 
orderly. This guidance states transaction or quoted prices for 

assets or liabilities in inactive markets may require adjustment 
due to the uncertainty of whethe
r the underlying transactions 
are orderly. Prior to our adopti
on of the new provisions for 
measuring fair value, we primar
ily used unadjusted independent 
vendor or broker quoted prices to measure fair value for 
substantially all securities available for sale. 
 In connection with the change in guidance for fair value 
measurement, we developed policies and procedures to 

determine when the level and volu
me of activity for our assets 
and liabilities requiring fair value measurements has 
significantly declined relative to normal conditions. For such 
items that use price quotes, such
 as certain security classes 
within securities available for sale, the degree of market 
inactivity and distressed transact
ions was analyzed to determine 
the appropriate adjustment
 to the price quotes. 
 The security classes where we 
consider the market to be less 
orderly include primarily non-agency residential MBS. The 
methodology used to adjust the quotes involved weighting the 
price quotes and results of internal pricing techniques such as 
the net present value of future expected cash flows (with 
observable inputs, where available)
 discounted at a rate of return 
market participants require. The si
gnificant inputs utilized in the 
internal pricing techniques, which were estimated by type of 

underlying collateral, included credit loss assumptions, 

estimated prepayment speeds and appropriate discount rates. 
 The more active and orderly markets for particular security 
classes were determined to be, 
the more weighting we assigned 
to price quotes. The less active and orderly markets were 
determined to be, the less weight
ing we assigned to price quotes. 
We continually assess the level and volume of market activity in 
our investment security classes in determining adjustments, if 
any, to price quotes. Given market conditions can change over 

time, determination of which secu
rities markets are considered 
active or inactive, and if inac
tive, the degree to which price 
quotes require adjustment, can also change. 

  Fair Value Hierarchy 
We group our assets and liabilities measured at fair value in 

three levels, based on the marke
ts in which the assets and 

liabilities are traded and the reli
ability of the assumptions used 
to determine fair value. These levels are: 
 Level 1 
Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical 
instruments traded in active markets.  
 Level 2 
Œ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or 
similar instruments in markets
 that are not active, and 
model-based valuation techniques for which all significant 
assumptions are observable in the market.  
 Level 3 
Œ Valuation is generated from model-based 
techniques that use significant assumptions not observable 

in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect 
estimates of assumptions that market participants would 
use in pricing the asset or li
ability. Valuation techniques 
190  include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow 
models and similar techniques.  
 In the determination of the 
classification of financial 
instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 
of the fair value hierarchy, we 
consider all available information, including observable market 

data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 

understanding of the valuation te
chniques and significant inputs 
used. For securities in inactive
 markets, we use a predetermined 
percentage to evaluate the impa
ct of fair value adjustments 
derived from weighting both external and internal indications of 

value to determine if the instrume
nt is classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each 
instrument or instrument category, judgments are made 
regarding the significance of
 the Level 3 inputs to the 
instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 
inputs are considered significant, 
the instrument is classified as 
Level 3. 
  Determination of Fair Value 
We base our fair values on the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 

transaction between market part
icipants at the measurement 
date. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize 

the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value 

measurements. 
 In instances where there is limited or no observable market 
data, fair value measurements for assets and liabilities are based 

primarily upon our own estimates or combination of our own 
estimates and independent vendor or broker pricing, and the 
measurements are often calculated
 based on current pricing for 

products we offer or issue, the economic and competitive 
environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and 
other such factors. As with an
y valuation technique used to 
estimate fair value, changes in underlying assumptions used, 
including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, 
could significantly affect the results of current or future values. 

Accordingly, these fair value estimates may not be realized in an 
actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. 
 We incorporate lack of liquidity into our fair value 

measurement based on the type of asset or liability measured 
and the valuation methodology used. For example, for certain 

residential MHFS and certain securities where the significant 
inputs have become unobservable
 due to illiquid markets and 
vendor or broker pricing is not used, we use a discounted cash 
flow technique to measure fa
ir value. This technique 
incorporates forecasting of expected cash flows (adjusted for 
credit loss assumptions and estimated prepayment speeds) 
discounted at an appropriate marke
t discount rate to reflect the 
lack of liquidity in the market that a market participant would 

consider. For other securities where vendor or broker pricing is 

used, we use either unadjusted brok
er quotes or vendor prices or 
vendor or broker prices adjusted by weighting them with 

internal discounted cash flow techniques to measure fair value. 
These unadjusted vendor or broker prices inherently reflect any 
lack of liquidity in the market,
 as the fair value measurement 
represents an exit price from a market participant viewpoint. 

 Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies 

used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring or nonrecurring basis an
d for estimating fair value for 
financial instruments not recorded at fair value. 
 Assets 
SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS
  Short-term financial assets 
include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and 

securities purchased under resale agreements and due from 

customers on acceptances. These assets are carried at historical 
cost. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
because of the relatively short 
time between the origination of 
the instrument and its expected realization. 
 TRADING ASSETS (EXCLUDING DERIVATIVES) AND 
SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE  
Trading assets and 
securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted 

prices in active markets, if available. Such instruments are 
classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples 
include exchange-traded equity securities and some highly liquid 
government securities such as U.S. Treasuries. When 
instruments are traded in seco
ndary markets and quoted market 
prices do not exist for such securities, we generally rely on 
internal valuation techniques 
or on prices obtained from 
independent pricing services or brokers (collectively, vendors) or 
combination thereof. 
 Trading securities are mostly va
lued using trader prices that 
are subject to internal price 
verification procedures. The 
majority of fair values derived using internal valuation 
techniques are verified against multiple pricing sources, 
including prices obtained from
 independent vendors. Vendors 
compile prices from various sources and often apply matrix 
pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. We 
review pricing methodologies provided by the vendors in order 
to determine if observable mar
ket information is being used, 
versus unobservable inputs. When we evaluate the 

appropriateness of an internal
 trader price compared with 

vendor prices, our considerations
 include the range and quality 
of vendor prices. Vendor pric
es are used to ensure the 
reasonableness of a trader price; however valuing financial 

instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a 
particular market and is not perfun
ctory. If a trader asserts that 
a vendor price is not reflective of market value, justification for 

using the trader price, including
 recent sales activity where 
possible, must be provided to 
and approved by the appropriate 
levels of management. 

 Similarly, while securities available for sale traded in 
secondary markets are 
typically valued using unadjusted vendor 
prices or vendor prices adjusted by weighting them with internal 
discounted cash flow techniques, 
these prices are reviewed and, 
if deemed inappropriate by a tr
ader who has the most knowledge 
of a particular market, can be adjusted. Securities measured with 

these internal valuation techniqu
es are generally classified as 
Level 2 of the hierarchy and often involve using quoted market 
prices for similar securities, pricing models, discounted cash 
flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market 
where available or combination of
 multiple valuation techniques. 
Examples include certain residential and commercial MBS,

(continued) 
 municipal bonds, U.S. government and agency MBS, and 
corporate debt securities. 

 Security fair value measurements using significant inputs 
that are unobservable in the mark
et due to limited activity or a 
less liquid market are classified
 as Level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. Such measurements in
clude securities valued using 
internal models or a combination of multiple valuation 
techniques such as weighting of internal models and vendor or 
broker pricing, where the unobserv
able inputs are significant to 
the overall fair value measurement. Securities classified as Level 
3 include certain residential and commercial MBS, asset-backed 
securities collateralized by auto leases or loans and cash 
reserves, CDOs and CLOs, and certain residual and retained 

interests in residential mortgage loan securitizations. CDOs are 
valued using the prices of similar instruments, the pricing of 
completed or pending third party 
transactions or the pricing of 
the underlying collateral with
in the CDO. Where vendor or 
broker prices are not readily available, management's best 

estimate is used. 
 MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE (MHFS)
  We carry substantially all 
of our residential MHFS portfolio at fair value. Fair value is 
based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or 
the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar 

characteristics. As necessary, thes
e prices are adjusted for typical 
securitization activities, including servicing value, portfolio 

composition, market conditions and liquidity. Most of our MHFS 

are classified as Level 2. For 
the portion where market pricing 
data is not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to 
estimate fair value and, accordingly, classify as Level 3.  
 LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  
LHFS are carried at the lower of 
cost or market value, or at fair value. The fair value of LHFS is 
based on what secondary markets
 are currently offering for 
portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, we classify those 

loans subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as 

Level 2. 
 LOANS  
For the carrying value of loans, including PCI loans, see 
Note 1. Although most loans are not recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, reverse mortgage
s, which were previously sold 
under a GNMA securitization program and were consolidated 

during fourth quarter 2011, are held
 at fair value on a recurring 
basis. In addition, we record no
nrecurring fair value adjustments 
to loans to reflect partial writ
e-downs that are based on the 
observable market price of the loa
n or current appraised value of 
the collateral. 

 We provide fair value estimates in this disclosure for loans 

that are not recorded at fair valu
e on a recurring or nonrecurring 
basis. Those estimates differentiate loans based on their 

financial characteristics, such as product classification, loan 

category, pricing features and remaining maturity. Prepayment 
and credit loss estimates are evaluated by product and loan rate. 
 The fair value of commercial loans is calculated by 
discounting contractual cash flows, adjusted for credit loss 
estimates, using discount rates 
that reflect our current pricing 
for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity. 
 For real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages, fair 

value is calculated by discou
nting contractual cash flows, 
adjusted for prepayment and credit loss estimates, using 
discount rates based on current industry pricing (where readily 
available) or our own estimate 
of an appropriate risk-adjusted 
discount rate for loans of similar size, type, remaining maturity 

and repricing characteristics. 

 The carrying value of credit card loans, which is adjusted for 
estimates of credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance 
sheet date, is reported as a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

 For all other consumer loans, the fair value is generally 
calculated by discounting the co
ntractual cash flows, adjusted 
for prepayment and credit loss es
timates, based on the current 
rates we offer for loans with similar characteristics. 

 Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial 
and similar letters of credit generate ongoing fees at our current 

pricing levels, which are recognized over the term of the 
commitment period. In situations wh
ere the credit quality of the 
counterparty to a commitment 
has declined, we record an 
allowance. A reasonable estimate
 of the fair value of these 
instruments is the carrying value of
 deferred fees plus the related 
allowance. Certain letters of credit that are hedged with 
derivative instruments are carried 
at fair value in trading assets 
or liabilities. For those letters of credit fair value is calculated 
based on readily quotable credit default spreads, using a market 
risk credit default swap model. 
 DERIVATIVES  
Quoted market prices are available and used for 
our exchange-traded derivatives, such as certain interest rate 

futures and option contracts, which we classify as Level 1. 
However, substantially all of our 
derivatives are traded in over-
the-counter (OTC) markets where quoted market prices are not 
always readily available. Therefore we value most OTC 
derivatives using internal va
luation techniques. Valuation 
techniques and inputs to internally-developed models depend on 

the type of derivative and nature 
of the underlying rate, price or 
index upon which the derivative's 
value is based. Key inputs can 
include yield curves, credit curves, foreign-exchange rates, 

prepayment rates, volatility measurements and correlation of 

such inputs. Where model inputs 
can be observed in a liquid 
market and the model does not require significant judgment, 

such derivatives are typically clas
sified as Level 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 2 
include generic interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, 

commodity swaps, and certain option and forward contracts. 
When instruments are traded 
in less liquid markets and 
significant inputs are unobservable, such derivatives are 

classified as Level 3. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 3 

include complex and highly structured derivatives, certain credit 
default swaps, interest rate lo
ck commitments written for our 
residential mortgage loans that we intend to sell and long dated 
equity options where volatility is not observable. Additionally, 
significant judgments are required when classifying financial 
instruments within the fair value 
hierarchy, particularly between 
Level 2 and 3, as is the case for certain derivatives.  
  192  MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs) AND CERTAIN OTHER 
INTERESTS HELD IN SECURITIZATIONS  
MSRs and certain 
other interests held in securitizations (e.g., interest-only strips) 
do not trade in an active market 
with readily observable prices. 
Accordingly, we determine the 
fair value of MSRs using a 
valuation model that calculates 
the present value of estimated 
future net servicing income cash flows. The model incorporates 
assumptions that market participants use in estimating future 
net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of 
prepayment speeds (including housing price volatility), discount 

rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and 
foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual 
servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Commercial 

MSRs and certain residential MSRs are carried at lower of cost 
or market value, and therefore can be subject to fair value 
measurements on a nonrecurring ba
sis. Changes in the fair value 
of MSRs occur primarily due to the collection/realization of 
expected cash flows, as well as changes in valuation inputs and 
assumptions. For other interests held in securitizations (such as 
interest-only strips) we use a valu
ation model that calculates the 
present value of estimated future cash flows. The model 
incorporates our own estimates of assumptions market 
participants use in determining the fair value, including 
estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rates, defaults and 

contractual fee income. Interest-only strips are recorded as 
trading assets. Our valuation approach is validated by our 
internal valuation model validation group and our valuation 

estimates are periodically 
benchmarked to independent 
appraisals. Fair value measurements of our MSRs and interest-
only strips use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, 
we classify as Level 3.  
 FORECLOSED ASSETS  
Foreclosed assets are carried at net 
realizable value, which represents
 fair value less estimated costs 
to sell. Fair value is generally based upon independent market 

prices or appraised values of the collateral and, accordingly, we 

classify foreclosed assets as Level 2. 
 NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS  
Nonmarketable 
equity investments are generally 
recorded under the cost or 
equity method of accounting. There are generally restrictions on 

the sale and/or liquidation of
 these investments, including 
federal bank stock. Federal 
bank stock carrying value 
approximates fair value. We
 use facts and circumstances 
available to estimate the fair va
lue of our nonmarketable equity 
investments. We typically consider our access to and need for 
capital (including recent or projected financing activity), 
qualitative assessments of the viability of the investee, evaluation 

of the financial statements of th
e investee and prospects for its 
future. Public equity investme
nts are valued using quoted 
market prices and discounts are 
only applied when there are 
trading restrictions that are an 
attribute of the investment. We 
estimate the fair value of investments in non-public securities 
using metrics such as security prices of comparable public 
companies, acquisition prices for similar companies and original 
investment purchase price multiples, while also incorporating a 
portfolio company's financial performance and specific factors. 

For investments in private eq
uity funds, we use the NAV 
provided by the fund sponsor as 
an appropriate measure of fair 
value. In some cases, such NAVs require adjustments based on 
certain unobservable inputs. 
 Liabilities 
DEPOSIT LIABILITIES  
Deposit liabilities are carried at historical 
cost. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as 
noninterest-bearing demand deposi
ts, interest-bearing checking, 
and market rate and other savings, is equal to the amount 

payable on demand at the measur
ement date. The fair value of 
other time deposits is calculated based on the discounted value 
of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using 
the rates currently offered for like wholesale deposits with 

similar remaining maturities. 
 SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  
Short-term financial 
liabilities are carried at historical cost and include federal funds 
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, 
commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. The 
carrying amount is a reasonable es
timate of fair value because of 
the relatively short time be
tween the origination of the 
instrument and its expected realization. 
 OTHER LIABILITIES  
Other liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, excluding derivative liabilities (see the 

ﬁDerivativesﬂ
 section for derivative liabilities), includes 
primarily short sale liabilities. Short sale liabilities are classified 
as either Level 1 or Level 2, 
generally dependent upon whether 
the underlying securities have readily obtainable quoted prices 
in active exchange markets.  
 LONG-TERM DEBT  
Long-term debt is generally carried at 
amortized cost. For disclosure, we are required to estimate the 
fair value of long-term debt. Gene
rally, the discounted cash flow 
method is used to estimate the fair value of our long-term debt. 

Contractual cash flows are discounted using rates currently 

offered for new notes with similar remaining maturities and, as 
such, these discount rates include our current spread levels.  
193Note 17:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
(continued) 
  Fair Value Measurements from Independent 
Brokers or Independent Third Party Pricing Services 
For certain assets and liabilities, we obtain fair value 
measurements from independent brokers or independent third 
party pricing services and record the unadjusted fair value in our 
financial statements. The detail 
by level is shown in the table 
below. Fair value measurements obtained from independent 

brokers or independent third party 
pricing services that we have 
adjusted to determine the fair value recorded in our financial 
statements are not included in the following table.

200  Changes in Fair Value Levels 
We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess 
the appropriate classification of 
financial instruments within the 
fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-

based valuation techniques may re
quire the transfer of financial 
instruments from one fair value level to another. The amounts 

reported as transfers represent th
e fair value as of the beginning 
of the quarter in which 
the transfer occurred. 
 We evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based 

upon the nature of the financia
l instrument and size of the 
transfer relative to total assets, 
total liabilities or total earnings. 
For the year ended December
 31, 2011, we transferred 
$709 million of other trading assets from Level 2 to Level 1 due 
to use of more observable market data. We transferred 

$801 million of debt securities av
ailable for sale from Level 3 to 
Level 2 due to an increase in th
e volume of trading activity for 
certain securities, which resulted
 in increased occurrences of 
observable market prices. We also transferred $502 million of 
securities available for sale from
 Level 2 to Level 3 primarily due 
to a decrease in liquidity for certain asset-backed securities. 
 Significant changes to Level 3 assets for the year ended 
December 31, 2010 are described as follows: 
 We adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which 
impacted Level 3 balances for 
certain financial instruments. 
Reductions in Level 3 balances, which represent 

derecognition of existing investments in newly consolidated 

VIEs, are reflected as transfers out for the following 
categories: trading assets, $276 million; securities available 
for sale, $1.9 billion; and mortgage servicing rights, 
$118 million. Increases in Le
vel 3 balances, which represent 
newly consolidated VIE assets, are reflected as transfers in 
for the following categories: securities available for sale, 
$829 million; loans, $366 million; and long-term debt, 
$359 million. 
 We transferred $4.9 billion of securities available for sale 

from Level 3 to Level 2 due to an increase in the volume of 

trading activity for certain mortgage-backed and other 
asset-backed securities, which resulted in increased 
occurrences of observable market prices. We also 

transferred $1.7 billion of debt securities available for sale 
from Level 2 to Level 3, pri
marily due to a decrease in 
liquidity for certain asset-backed securities. 
 
 For the year ended December
 31, 2009, we transferred 
$4.0 billion of debt securities available for sale from Level 3 to 
Level 2 due to increased trading activity. 
 Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain 
assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with 
GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from 

application of LOCOM accounting 
or write-downs of individual 
assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

in 2011 and 2010 that were still held in the balance sheet at each 

respective year end, the followin
g table provides the fair value 
hierarchy and the carrying value of
 the related individual assets 
or portfolios at year end.

202  Alternative Investments 
The following table summarizes our investments in various types 

of funds, which are included in trading assets, securities 
available for sale and other assets. We use the funds™ net asset 
values (NAVs) per share as a practical expedient to measure fair 
value on recurring and nonrecur
ring bases. The fair values 
presented in the table are based 
upon the funds™ NAVs or an 
equivalent measure.

 Offshore funds primarily invest in investment grade 
European fixed-income securities. Redemption restrictions are 
in place for investments with a fair value of $200 million and 

$74 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to 
lock-up provisions that will remai
n in effect until October 2015.  
 Private equity funds invest in equity and debt securities 
issued by private and publicly
-held companies in connection 
with leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations and expansion 
opportunities. Substantially all of these investments do not allow 
redemptions. Alternatively, we
 receive distributions as the 
underlying assets of the funds liquidate, which we expect to 

occur over the next nine years.  

 Venture capital funds invest in domestic and foreign 
companies in a variety of industries, including information 
technology, financial services and healthcare. These investments 

can never be redeemed with the funds. Instead, we receive 
distributions as the underlying assets of the fund liquidate, 
which we expect to occur over the next six years.
  Fair Value Option 
We measure MHFS at fair value for prime MHFS originations 
for which an active secondary market and readily available 
market prices exist to reliably su
pport fair value pricing models 
used for these loans. Loan origin
ation fees on these loans are 
recognized when earned, and related direct loan origination 
costs are recognized when incurr
ed. We also measure at fair 
value certain of our other interests held related to residential 
loan sales and securitizations. We believe fair value 
measurement for prime MHFS and other interests held, which 
we hedge with free-standing derivatives (economic hedges) 
along with our MSRs, measured at fair value, reduces certain 
timing differences and better mat
ches changes in the value of 
these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as 
economic hedges for these assets. 
 Upon the acquisition of Wachov
ia, we elected to measure at 
fair value certain portfolios of LHFS that may be economically 
hedged with derivative instruments. In addition, we elected to 

measure at fair value certain lett
ers of credit that are hedged 
with derivative instruments to better reflect the economics of the 

transactions. These letters of 
credit are included in trading 
account assets or liabilities. 
 Upon the adoption of new cons
olidation guidance on January 
1, 2010, we elected to measure at
 fair value the eligible assets 
(loans) and liabilities (long-term debt) of certain nonconforming 

mortgage loan securitization VIEs. We elected the fair value 
option for such newly consolidated VIEs to continue fair value 

accounting as our interests prior to consolidation were 
predominantly carried at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognized in earnings. Upon cl
arifying guidance from the SEC 
during fourth quarter 2011, we consolidated reverse mortgage 
loans previously sold under a GNMA securitization program. We 
had initially elected fair value opti
on on these loans prior to sale, 
and, as such, they were consolidat
ed under fair value option.    
 The following table reflects the differences between fair value 

carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities for which we 

have elected the fair value opti
on and the contractual aggregate 
unpaid principal amount at maturity.

 subsequent to funding, gains and losses on 
the related loan commitment prior to funding, and premiums on acquired loans. 
 The assets accounted for under the 
fair value option are initially 
measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial 

measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are 

recognized in earnings. The changes in fair value related to 
initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value 

included in earnings for these assets measured at fair value are

               For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains or 
losses were derived principally by 
determining the change in fair 
value of the loans due to change
s in the observable or implied 
credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less 
the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. In recent years 
spreads have been significantly affected by the lack of liquidity in 
the secondary market for mortgage loans. For nonperforming 

loans, we attribute al
l changes in fair value to instrument-
specific credit risk.
 204  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
The table below is a summary of fa
ir value estimates for financial 
instruments, excluding short-term financial assets and liabilities 
because carrying amounts approxim
ate fair value, and excluding 
financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
The carrying amounts in the follo
wing table are recorded in the 
balance sheet under the indicated captions. 
We have not included assets and liabilities that are not 
financial instruments in our disclosure, such as the value of the 

long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust 
customers, amortized MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill 
and other intangibles, deferred taxes and other liabilities. The 
total of the fair value calculatio
ns presented does not represent, 
and should not be construed to 
represent, the underlying value 
of the Company.

d. At December 31, 2010, long-term debt excludes balances for

Loans exclude lease financing with a carrying amount of $13.1 billion at both December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
(4) The carrying amount and fair value exclude obligations under ca
pital leases of $116 million and $26 million at December 31, 201
1 and 2010, respectively.
   Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial 
and similar letters of credit are 
not included in the table above.  
A reasonable estimate of the fair
 value of these instruments is 
the carrying value of deferred fees plus the related allowance. 

This amounted to $495 million and $673 million at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(1) Preferred shares qualify as Tier 1 capital. 
206   In March 2011, the Company issued Series I preferred stock 
(25,010 shares with a par value of $2.5 billion) to an 

unconsolidated wholly-owned tr
ust. We have the option to 
redeem this Series I Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in 
part, at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share. 
  In 2011, we redeemed $9.2 billion of trust preferred 
securities of which $5.8 billion settled in October 2011. Prior to 

the October 2011 redemption, we had a commitment to issue 
Series A preferred stock ($2.5 bi
llion) and Series B preferred 
stock ($1.8 billion) to unconsolidated wholly-owned trusts. 
Effective with the redemption, the commitment has been 
eliminated. See Note 8 for additional information on our trust 
preferred securities. We do not have a commitment to issue 

Series G or H preferred stock. 
  ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
  All shares of our ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock 

(ESOP Preferred Stock) were issued to a trustee acting on behalf 
of the Wells Fargo & Company 401(
k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). 
Dividends on the ESOP Preferred 
Stock are cumulative from the 
date of initial issuance and are 
payable quarterly at annual rates 
based upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred 
Stock released from the unallocate
d reserve of the 401(k) Plan is 
converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated 

value of the ESOP Preferred St
ock and the then current market 
price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also 
convertible at the option of 
the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP 
Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption 
price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends or 
(b) the fair market value, as 
defined in the Certificates of De
signation for the ESOP Preferred 
Stock.

 At December 31, 2011, we have warrants outstanding and 
exercisable to purchase 39,179,509 shares of our common stock 

with an exercise price of $3
4.01 per share, expiring on 
October 28, 2018. In 2011 we
 purchased 264,972 of these 
warrants. These warrants were issued in connection with our 

participation in the TARP CPP. 
 Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock 

Purchase Plans 
Participants in our dividend reinvestment and common stock 
direct purchase plans may purchase shares of our common stock 

at fair market value under the terms of the plan. 
 Employee Stock Plans 
We offer stock based employee compensation plans as described 

below. We measure the cost of em
ployee services received in 
exchange for an award of equity instruments, such as stock 
options, restricted share rights (RSRs) or performance shares, 
based on the fair value of the awar
d on the grant date. The cost is 
normally recognized in our income statement over the vesting 

period of the award; awards with
 graded vesting are expensed on 
a straight line method. Awards 
that continue to vest after 
retirement are expensed over the 
shorter of the period of time 

between the grant date and the fi
nal vesting period or between 
the grant date and when a team member becomes retirement 

eligible; awards to team members who are retirement eligible at 

the grant date are subject to immediate expensing upon grant.  
 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS
 Our Long- 
Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP) provides for awards 
of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation 

rights, restricted shares, RSRs, performance share awards and 
stock awards without restrictions. 
 During 2011 and 2010 we granted RSRs and performance 
shares as our primary long-term incentive awards instead of 
stock options. Holders of RSRs ar
e entitled to the related shares 
of common stock at no cost gene
rally over three to five years 
after the RSRs were gr
anted. Holders of RSRs
 may be entitled to 
receive additional RSRs (dividend equivalents) or cash payments 
equal to the cash dividends that
 would have been paid had the 
RSRs been issued and outstand
ing shares of common stock. 
RSRs granted as dividend equiva
lents are subject to the same 
vesting schedule and conditions as the underlying RSRs. RSRs 

generally continue to vest after retirement according to the 

original vesting schedule. Except 
in limited circumstances, RSRs 
are cancelled when employment ends. 

 Holders of each vested perfor
mance share are entitled to the 
related shares of common stock at no cost. Performance shares 
continue to vest after retirement according to the original vesting 
schedule subject to satisfying th
e performance criteria and other 
vesting conditions. 
 Stock options must have an exercise price at or above fair 
market value (as defined in the plan
) of the stock at the date of 
grant (except for substitute or replacement options granted in 
connection with mergers or other acquisitions) and a term of no 
more than 10 years. Except for options granted in 2004 and 
2005, which generally vested in full upon grant, options 
generally become exercisable over
 three years beginning on the 
first anniversary of the date of
 grant. Except as otherwise 
permitted under the plan, if em
ployment is ended for reasons 
other than retirement, permanent disability or death, the option 

exercise period is reduced or
 the options are cancelled. 
 Options granted prior to 20
04 may include the right to 
acquire a ﬁreloadﬂ stock option. 
If an option contains the reload 
feature and if a participant pays al
l or part of the exercise price 
of the option with shares of 
stock purchased in the market or 
held by the participant for at least six months and, in either case, 

not used in a similar transaction in the last six months, upon 
exercise of the option, the partic
ipant is granted a new option to 
purchase at the fair market value of
 the stock as of the date of the 
reload, the number of shares of
 stock equal to the sum of the 
number of shares used in paym
ent of the exercise price and a 

number of shares with respect to related statutory minimum 

withholding taxes. Reload grants 
are fully vested upon grant and 
are expensed immediately. 

 Compensation expense for RSRs and performance shares is 

based on the quoted market pric
e of the related stock at the 
grant date. Stock option expense is
 based on the fair value of the 
awards at the date of grant. 
The following table summarizes the 
major components of stock incentive compensation expense and 

the related recognized tax benefit.

that are normally paid
 in cash was paid in
 our common stock as 
part of our agreement with th
e U.S. Treasury to repay our 
participation in the TARP CPP. Th
e fair value of 
the stock that 
was issued was $94 million and th
ere were no vesting conditions 
or other restrictions on the stock. No annual bonus awards 
recognized after 2009 were paid in common stock. 

 During 2009 the Board of Directors approved salary 
increases for certain executive offi
cers that were paid, after taxes 
and other withholdings, in our common stock. In 2010 and 
2009, respectively, 62,630 shar
es and 244,689 shares were 
issued for salary increases at an average fair value of $27.44 and 

$27.77, respectively. There are no restrictions on these shares 

because we repaid the TARP CPP 
investment in Wells Fargo in 
December 2009. No salary increases were paid in common stock 

after March 2010. 

 For various acquisitions and mergers, we converted employee 
and director stock options of acquired or merged companies into 
stock options to purchase our 
common stock based on the terms 
of the original stock option plan and the agreed-upon exchange 

ratio. In addition, we converte
d restricted stock awards into 
awards that entitle holders to
 our stock after the vesting 
conditions are met. Holders 
receive cash dividends on 
outstanding awards if provided in the original award. 

 The total number of shares of common stock available for 
grant under the plans at Decemb
er 31, 2011, was 157 million. 
 PARTNERSHARES
 PLAN
  In 1996, we adopted the 
PartnerShares
® Stock Option Plan, a broad-based employee 
stock option plan. It covers full- and part-time employees who 
generally were not included in the LTICP described above. No 

options have been granted under 
the plan since 2002, and as a 
result of action taken by the Board of Directors on 

January 22, 2008, no future awards will be granted under the 
plan. All of our 
PartnerShares
 Plan grants were fully vested as of 
December 31, 2007. 
 Director Awards 
Under the LTICP, we grant common stock and options to 
purchase common stock to non-employee directors elected or re-
elected at the annual meeting of stockholders and prorated 
awards to directors who join the Board at any other time. The 

stock award vests immediately. Op
tions granted to directors can 
be exercised after twelve months
 through the tenth anniversary 
of the grant date. Options granted prior to 2005 may include the 

right to acquire a ﬁreloadﬂ stock option.

of RSRs that vested during 2011, 
2010 and 2009 was $41 million, $15 million and $2 million, 

respectively. 
 Performance Share Awards 
Holders of performance share awar
ds are entitled to the related 
shares of common stock at no cost subject to the Company's 
achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year 

period ending December 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, and 
December 31, 2012. Performance share awards are granted at a 
target number; based on the Company's performance, the 
number of awards that vest can be adjusted downward to zero 
and upward to a maximum of either 125% or 150% of target.

                               As of December 31, 2011, there was $8 million of 
unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options. That 
cost is expected to be recognized
 over a weighted-average period 
of 0.3 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $246 million, $298 million and 
$50 million, respectively. 
 Cash received from the exerci
se of stock options for 2011, 
2010 and 2009 was $554 million, 
$687 million and $153 million, 
respectively. 

 We do not have a specific policy on repurchasing shares to 
satisfy share option exercises. Rather, we have a general policy 
on repurchasing shares to meet common stock issuance 

requirements for our benefit plans (including share option 
exercises), conversion of our convertible securities, acquisitions 
and other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the 

amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our 
capital requirements, the number of
 shares we expect to issue for 
acquisitions and employee benefit plans, market conditions 
(including the trading price of 
our stock), and regulatory and 
legal considerations. These factor
s can change at any time, and 
there can be no assurance as to 
the number of shares we will 
repurchase or when we will repurchase them. 
 The fair value of each option award granted on or after 

January 1, 2006, is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation 
model. The expected term of non-reload options granted is 
generally based on the historical exercise behavior of full-term 

options. Our expected volatilities are based on a combination of 
the historical volatility of our common stock and implied 
volatilities for traded options on our common stock. The risk-

free rate is based on the U.S. Tr
easury zero-coupon yield curve in 
effect at the time of grant. Both
 expected volatility and the risk-
free rates are based on a period commensurate with our 
expected term. Beginning in 2009, the expected dividend is 
based on a fixed dividend amount. We changed our method of 

estimating the expected dividend assumption from a yield 
approach to a fixed amount due to
 our participation in the TARP 
CPP during 2009, which restricted us from increasing our 

dividend without approval from the U.S. Treasury; although we 
repaid TARP in 2009, federal approval continues to be required 
before we can increase our divi
dend. A dividend yield approach 
models a constant dividend yield, which was considered 
inappropriate given the restriction on our ability to increase 
dividends. See Note 3 for additional information. 
  210  The following table presents the weighted-average per share 
fair value of options granted an
d the assumptions used, based on 
a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Substantially all of the 
options granted in 2011 and 2010 resulted from the reload 
feature.

                   Employee Stock Ownership Plan  
The Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a 

defined contribution plan with an Employee Stock Ownership 

Plan (ESOP) feature. Effective December 31, 2009, the Wachovia 
Savings Plan, which also had an 
ESOP feature, merged into the 
401(k) Plan, and all of its shares of our common stock were 
transferred to the 401(k) Plan
. The ESOP feature enables the 
401(k) Plan to borrow money to purchase our preferred or 
common stock. From 1994 throug
h 2011, with the exception of 
2009, we loaned money to the 401(k) Plan to purchase shares of 
our ESOP Preferred Stock. As our employer contributions are 
made to the 401(k) Plan and are 
used by the Plan to make ESOP 
loan payments, the ESOP Preferred 
Stock in the 401(k) Plan is 
released and converted into our common shares. Dividends on 
the common shares allocated as a result of the release and 

conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock reduce retained 
earnings and the shares are 
considered outstanding for 
computing earnings per share. Dividends on the unallocated 
ESOP Preferred Stock do not reduce retained earnings, and the 
shares are not considered to 
be common stock equivalents for 
computing earnings per share. Loan principal and interest 
payments are made from our em
ployer contributions to the 
401(k) Plan, along with dividend
s paid on the ESOP Preferred 
Stock. With each principal and interest payment, a portion of the 

ESOP Preferred Stock is released and converted to common 
shares, which are allocated to th
e 401(k) Plan participants and 
invested in the 401(k) Plan™s ESOP Fund.

Agents 
WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Parent formed solely to sponsor a deferred 
compensation plan for independent sales agents who provide 
investment, financial and other qualifying services for or with 

respect to participating affiliates. 
The Nonqualified Deferred Comp
ensation Plan for Independent 
Contractors, which became effective January 1, 2002, allows 
participants to defer all or part
 of their eligible compensation 
payable to them by a participatin
g affiliate. The Parent has fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed
 the deferred compensation 
obligations of WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. under 

the plan. 
211  Note 20: Employee Benefits and Other Expenses 
 Pension and Postretirement Plans 
We sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit 
retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan 
(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of 
Wells Fargo. Benefits accrued un
der the Cash Balance Plan were 
frozen effective July 1, 2009. 
 On April 28, 2009, the Board of Directors approved 
amendments to freeze the benefits earned under the Wells Fargo 

qualified and supplemental Cash Balance Plans and the 
Wachovia Corporation Pension Pl
an, a cash balance plan that 
covered eligible employees of the legacy Wachovia Corporation, 
and to merge the Wachovia Pensio
n Plan into the qualified Cash 
Balance Plan. These actions became effective on July 1, 2009. 

 Prior to July 1, 2009, eligible
 employees' cash balance plan 
accounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a 
percentage of their qualifying compensation. The compensation 
credit percentage was based on ag
e and years of credited service. 
The freeze discontinues the allocation of compensation credit for 

services after June 30, 2009. Investment credits continue to be 

allocated to participants based on their accumulated balances. 
Employees become vested in thei
r Cash Balance Plan accounts 
after completing three years of vesting service. 
 Freezing and merging the above plans effective July 1, 2009, 
resulted in a re-measurement of the pension obligations and 
plan assets as of April 30, 2009. As a result of freezing our 

pension plans, we revised our amortization life for actuarial 

gains and losses from 5 years to 13 years to reflect the estimated 
average remaining participation 
period. These actions lowered 
pension cost by approximately $500 million for 2009, including 

$67 million of one-time curtailment gains.  
We did not make a contribution to our Cash Balance Plan in 
2011. We do not expect that we will be required to make a 

contribution to the Cash Balance 
Plan in 2012; however, this is 
dependent on the finalization of
 the actuarial valuation. Our 
decision of whether to make a contribution in 2012 will be based 

on various factors including the actual investment performance 
of plan assets during 2012. Give
n these uncertainties, we cannot 
estimate at this time the amount, 
if any, that we will contribute 
in 2012 to the Cash Balance Pl
an. For the nonqualified pension 
plans and postretirement benefit plans, there is no minimum 
required contribution beyond th
e amount needed to fund benefit 
payments; we may contribute more to our postretirement benefit 
plans dependent on various factors. 
 We provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain 
retired employees and reserve the right to terminate, modify or 
amend any of the benefits at any time.

e following tables is based on 
current actuarial reports usin

                        We generally amortize net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a 
5% corridor from accumulated OCI
 into net periodic pension 
cost over the estimated average 
remaining participation period. 
The net actuarial loss for the defined benefit pension plans and 
other post retirement plans that will be amortized from 

accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is 
$141 million. The net prior service credit for the other post 
retirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI 

into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $2 million. 
 Plan Assumptions 
For the years ended December 31
, 2011 and 2010, the weighted-
average discount rate used to 
determine the projected benefit 
obligation for pension benefits (qualified and nonqualified) was 

5.00% and 5.25%, respectively, and for other postretirement 

benefits was 4.75% and 5.25%, re
spectively. We use a consistent 
methodology to determine the discount rate that is based on an 

established yield curve methodology. This methodology 

incorporates a broad group of top 
quartile Aa bonds consisting of 
approximately 250-275 bonds. The 
discount rate is determined 

by matching this yield curve with
 the timing and amounts of the 
expected benefit payments for our plans. 
 The weighted-average assumptions used to de
termine the net periodic benefit cost were:

(2) Due to the freeze of the Wells Fargo qualified and supplement
al Cash Balance Plans and the Wachovia Corporation Pension Pla
n, the discount rate for the 2009 pension 
benefits was the weighted average of 6.75% from January through April and 7.75% from May through December. 
 
  Our determination of the reasonableness of our expected 
long-term rate of return on plan assets is highly quantitative by 
nature. We evaluate the current 
asset allocations and expected 
returns under two sets of cond
itions: projected returns using 
several forward-looking capital market assumptions, and 
historical returns for the main asset classes dating back to 1970 
or the earliest period for which historical data was readily 
available for the asset classes included. Using long term 

historical data allows us to
 capture multiple economic 
environments, which we believe is relevant when using historical 

returns. We place greater emphasis on the forward-looking 

return and risk assumptions than on historical results. We use 
the resulting projections to derive
 a base line expected rate of 
return and risk level for the Cash
 Balance Plans' prescribed asset 
mix.  We evaluate the portfolio base
d on: (1) the established target 
asset allocations over short term (one-year) and longer term 
(ten-year) investment horizons, and (2) the range of potential 

outcomes over these horizons within specific standard 
deviations. We perform the ab
ove analyses to assess the 
reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets. We consider the expected rate of return to be a long-term 
average view of expected returns. The expected rate of return 
would be assessed for significant long-term changes in economic 
conditions or in planned portfolio composition. 

 To account for postretirement health care plans we use 
health care cost trend rates to recognize the effect of expected 
changes in future health care co
sts due to medical inflation, 

utilization changes, new technology, regulatory requirements 
and Medicare cost shifting. In determining the end of year 
benefit obligation we assume average annual increases of 

approximately 7.75% for health care costs in 2012. This rate is 
assumed to trend down 0.25% pe
r year until the trend rate 
reaches an ultimate rate of 5.
0% in 2023. The 2011 periodic 
214  benefit cost was determined usin
g initial annual trend rates of 
8.0%. These rates were assumed 
to decrease 0.25% per year 
until they reached ultimate rates of 5.0% in 2023. Increasing the 
assumed health care trend by one percentage point in each year 
would increase the benefit obligati
on as of December 31, 2011, by 
$63 million and the total of the 
interest cost and service cost 
components of the net periodic benefit cost for 2011 by 

$3 million. Decreasing the assumed health care trend by one 
percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 20
11, by $56 million and the total 
of the interest cost and service cost components of the net 
periodic benefit cost for 2011 by $3 million. 
 Investment Strategy and Asset Allocation 
We seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a 
prudent level of risk given the be
nefit obligations of the pension 
plans and their funded status. Our 
overall investment strategy is 
designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a balance of 

long-term growth opportunities and short-term benefit 
strategies while ensuring that risk is mitigated through 
diversification across numerous asset classes and various 

investment strategies. We target 
the asset allocation for our Cash 
Balance Plan at a target mix ra
nge of 35-55% equities, 35-55% 
fixed income, and approximately 10% in real estate, venture 
capital, private equity and othe
r investments. The Employee 
Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes several 

members of senior management, formally reviews the 

investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a 

quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic 
asset/liability evaluations are also conducted. 
 The investment strategy for assets held in the Retiree Medical 

Plan Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust 
is established separately from the strategy for the assets in the 
Cash Balance Plan. The general target asset mix is 20-40% 
equities and 60-80% fixed income. In addition, the strategy for 
the VEBA trust assets considers 
the effect of income taxes by 
utilizing a combination of variable annuity and low turnover 
investment strategies. Members of the EBRC formally review the 
investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly 

basis. 
Projected Benefit Payments 
Future benefits that we expect
 to pay under the pension and 
other benefit plans are presented 
in the following table. Other 
benefits payments are expected to be reduced by prescription 

drug subsidies from the federal government provided by the 
Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement and Modernization 
Act of 2003.

(1) This category includes a diversified mix of assets which are being managed in accordance with a duration target of approxim
ately 10 years and an emphasis on corporate 
credit bonds combined with investments in U.S. Treasury securiti
es and other U.S. agency and non-agency bonds.  Investments in 
this category were made beginning in 
2011. 
(2) This category includes assets that are primarily intermediate
 duration, investment grade bonds held in investment strategie
s benchmarked to the Barclays Capital U.S. 
Aggregate Bond Index. Includes U.S. Treasury securities, agen
cy and non-agency asset-backed bonds and corporate bonds.   
(3) This category covers a broad range of investment styles, bo
th active and passive approaches, as well as style characteristi
cs of value, core and growth emphasized 
strategies. Assets in this category are currently diversified across nine unique investment strategies. For December 31, 2011 a
nd 2010, respectively, approximately 34% and 
33% of the assets within this category are passively managed to popular mainstream market indexes including the Standard & Poor
's 500 Index; excluding the allocation to 
the S&P 500 Index strategy, no single investment manage
r represents more than 2.5% of total plan assets. 
(4) This category consists of a highly diversified combination of four distinct investment management strategies with no single
 strategy representing more than 2% of total plan 
assets. Allocations in this category are primarily spread across 
actively managed approaches with distinct value and growth emp
hasized approaches in fairly equal 
proportions. 
(5) This category includes assets diversified across eight unique investment strategies providing exposure to companies based p
rimarily in developed market, non-U.S. countries 
with no single strategy representing more than 2.5% of total plan assets. 
(6) This category primarily includes investments in private and 
public real estate, as well as timber specific limited partners
hips; real estate holdings are diversified by 
geographic location and sector (e.g., retail, office, apartments). 
(7) This category consists of several investment strategies diversified over 30 hedge fund managers. Single manager allocation 
exposure is limited to 0.15% (15 basis points) of 
total plan assets.

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES
  Following is a description of the 
valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Œ includes highly liquid government 
securities such as U.S. Treasuries. Also includes investments in 
collective investment funds valued at fair value based upon the 

quoted market values of the underlying net assets. The unit price 

is quoted on a private market that 
is not active; however, the unit 
price is based on underlying investments traded on an active 

market. Investments in registered investment companies are 
valued at the NAV of shares held at year end. 
 Long Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, International 

and Specialty Fixed Income 
Œ includes investments traded on 
the secondary markets; 
prices are measured by using quoted 
market prices for similar securities, pricing models, discounted 

cash flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the 
market where available or combination of multiple valuation 
techniques. Also includes investments in registered investment 
companies, collective investment funds and government 
securities described above.  

 
Domestic, International and Emerging Market Stocks 
Œ investments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at 

quoted market values. Also includes investments in registered 
investment companies and collective investment funds described 
above. 
 
Real Estate and Timber 
Œ the fair value of real estate and timber 
is estimated based primarily on 
appraisals prepared by third-
217Note 20:  Employee Benefits and Other Expenses 
(continued) 
 party appraisers. Market values
 are estimates and the actual 
market price of the real estate
 can only be determined by 
negotiation between independent third parties in a sales 
transaction. Also includes investments in exchange-traded 
equity securities described above. 
 Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds and Private Equity 
Œ the fair values 
of hedge funds are valued based 
on the proportionate share of 
the underlying net assets of the investment funds that comprise 

the fund, based on valuations supplied by the underlying 

investment funds. Investments in
 private equity funds are valued 
at the NAV provided 
by the fund sponsor. Market values are 
estimates and the actual market 
price of the investments can 
only be determined by negotiation between independent third 
parties in a sales transaction. 
 Other Œ the fair values of miscella
neous investments are valued 
at the NAV provided 
by the fund sponsor. Market values are 
estimates and the actual market 
price of the investments can 
only be determined by negotiation between independent third 
parties in a sales transaction. 
Also includes insurance contracts 
that are generally stated at cash surrender value.  
The methods described above may produce a fair value 
calculation that may not be indica
tive of net realizable value or 
reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation 
methods are appropriate and co
nsistent with other market 
participants, the use of differen
t methodologies or assumptions 
to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could 
result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting 
date.  Defined Contribution Retirement Plans 
We sponsor a defined contribution retirement plan named the 
Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). The 
Wachovia Savings Plan was acqu
ired December 31, 2008, and 
merged with the 401(k) Plan ef
fective December 31, 2009. We 
also sponsored a frozen define
d contribution plan, the A.G. 
Edwards, Inc. Retirement & Profit Sharing Plan (ﬁAGE Planﬂ), 
which resulted from a company acquired by Wachovia. The AGE 

Plan merged with the 401(k) Plan on July 1, 2011. Under the 
401(k) Plan, after one month of service, eligible employees may 
contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, although 

there may be a lower limit for certain highly compensated 

employees in order to maintain the 
qualified status of the 401(k) 
Plan. Eligible employees who complete one year of service are 

eligible for company matching contributions, which are generally 
dollar for dollar up to 6% of an employee's certified 
compensation. Effective January 
1, 2010, previous and future 
matching contributions are 100% ve
sted for active participants. 
In 2009, the 401(k) Plan was 
amended to permit us to make 
discretionary profit sharing contributions. Based on 2011, 2010 
and 2009 earnings, we committed to make a contribution in 
shares of common stock to eligible employees™ 401(k) Plan 
accounts equaling 2% of certified compensation for 2011 and 
2010, and 1% of certified compensation for 2009, respectively, 
which resulted in recognizing $311 million, $316 million and 

$150 million of defined contribution retirement plan expense 
recorded in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total defined 
contribution retirement plan expenses were $1,104 million, 

$1,092 million and $862 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, 
respectively.

                    Deferred taxes related to net unrealized gains (losses) on 
securities available for sale, net unrealized gains (losses) on 
derivatives, foreign currency translation, and employee benefit 
plan adjustments are recorded in 
cumulative OCI (see Note 23). 
These associated adjustments increased OCI by $1.1 billion in 
2011. 

 We have determined that a va
luation allowance is required 
for 2011 in the amount of $918 
million primarily attributable to 
deferred tax assets in various 
state and foreign jurisdictions 
where we believe it is more likely
 than not that these deferred tax 
assets will not be realized. In these jurisdictions, carry back 
limitations, lack of sources of taxable income, and tax planning 
strategy limitations contributed to our conclusion that the 

deferred tax assets would not be
 realizable. We have concluded 
that it is more likely than no
t that the remaining deferred tax 
assets will be realized based on our history of earnings, sources 
of taxable income in carry back periods, and our ability to 
implement tax planning strategies. 
 At December 31, 2011, we had net operating loss and credit 

carry forwards with related deferred tax assets of $1.6 billion and 
$81 million, respectively. If thes
e carry forwards are not utilized, 
they will expire in varying amounts through 2031. 
 At December 31, 2011, we had undistributed foreign earnings 
of $1.2 billion related to foreign subsidiaries. We intend to 
reinvest these earnings indefi
nitely outside the U.S. and 
accordingly have not provided $339 million of income tax 

liability on these earnings. 

 The following table reconciles the statutory federal income 
tax expense and rate to the ef
fective income tax expense and 
rate. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting 
guidance that changed the way 
noncontrolling interests are 
presented in the income statem
ent such that the consolidated 
income statement includes amounts from both Wells Fargo 

interests and the noncontrolling interests. As a result, our 

effective tax rate is calculated by
 dividing income tax expense by 
income before income tax expense less the net income from 

noncontrolling interests.

 The effective tax rate for 2011
 decreased primarily due to tax 
benefits from the realization for tax purposes of a previously 
written down investment, a decrease in tax expense associated 
with leveraged leases, as well as tax benefits related to charitable 

donations of appreciated securities.

                  Of the $5.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits at 
December 31, 2011, approximately $3.3 billion would, if 

recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The remaining 
$1.7 billion of unrecognized tax benefits relates to income tax 
positions on temporary differences. 

 We recognize interest and penalties as a component of 
income tax expense. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have 
accrued approximately $871 million and $870 million for the 

payment of interest and penalties, respectively. We recognized in 
income tax expense in 2011 and 2010, interest and penalties of 
$32 million and $45 million, respectively. 
 We are subject to U.S. federal 
income tax as well as income 
tax in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. With few 
exceptions, Wells Fargo and its su
bsidiaries are not subject to 
federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations for 

taxable years prior to 2007; an
d Wachovia Corporation and its 
subsidiaries are not subject to federal, state, local and foreign 
income tax examinations for ta
xable years prior to 2006. 
  We are routinely examined by tax authorities in various 
jurisdictions. The IRS is current
ly examining the 2007 through 
2010 consolidated federal income tax returns of Wells Fargo & 
Company and its subsidiaries. We ar
e also litigating or appealing 
various issues related to our prior IRS examinations for the 
periods 1999 and 2003 through 2006. 
For Wachovia™s 2003 
through 2008 tax years, we are 
appealing various issues related 
to their IRS examinations. We ha
ve paid the IRS the contested 
income tax associated with these 
issues and refund claims have 
been filed for the respective year
s. In addition, we are currently 
subject to examination by various state, local and foreign taxing 
authorities. While it is possib
le that one or more of these 
examinations may be resolved within the next twelve months, we 
do not anticipate that there will
 be a significant impact to our 
unrecognized tax benefits as a result of these examinations. 
During 2010, we filed a Notice of
 Appeal to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in connection with the adverse 
judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims related to certain 
leveraged lease transactions that
 we entered into between 1997 
and 2002. On April 15, 2011, th
e Federal Circuit affirmed the 
decision of the Court of Federal Claims. There was no adverse 

financial statement impact resulting from the Federal Circuit
™s 
decision. 
 On September 30, 2011, we rece
ived an adverse decision from 
the U.S. District Court for th
e District of Minnesota in WFC 
Holdings Corp. v. United States, a case involving a lease 

restructuring transaction. There was no adverse financial 
statement impact from the decisi
on. On December 1, 2011, we 
filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Eighth Circuit. 
We estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits will not 
change significantly during the next 12 months.

222  Note 24: Operating Segments 
 We have three operating segments for management reporting: 
Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, 
Brokerage and Retirement. The results for these operating 
segments are based on our management accounting process, for 
which there is no comprehens
ive, authoritative guidance 

equivalent to GAAP for financial accounting. The management 
accounting process measures the performance of the operating 
segments based on our management structure and is not 

necessarily comparable with similar information for other 
financial services companies. We define our operating segments 
by product type and customer segment. If the management 

structure and/or the allocation process changes, allocations, 
transfers and assignments may change. In first quarter 2010, we 
conformed certain funding and allocation methodologies of 

legacy Wachovia to those of Wells Fargo; in addition, integration 
expense related to mergers other than the Wachovia merger is 
now included in segment results. In fourth quarter 2010, we 
aligned certain lending businesses into Wholesale Banking from 
Community Banking to reflect our previously announced 

restructuring of Wells Fargo Financial. In first quarter 2011, we 
realigned a private equity business into Wholesale Banking from 
Community Banking. The prior periods have been revised to 

reflect these changes.  
 Community Banking
 offers a complete line of diversified 
financial products and services to consumers and small 

businesses with annual sales generally up to $20 million in 
which the owner generally is 
the financial decision maker. 
Community Banking also offers investment management and 
other services to retail customers and securities brokerage 
through affiliates. These products and services include the 

Wells Fargo Advantage Funds
SM, a family of mutual funds. Loan 
products include lines of credit, auto floor plan lines, equity lines 

and loans, equipment and transportation loans, education loans, 

origination and purchase of residential mortgage loans and 
servicing of mortgage loans and credit cards. Other credit 
products and financial services available to small businesses and 

their owners include equipment leases, real estate and other 
commercial financing, Small Business Administration financing, 
venture capital financing, cash
 management, payroll services, 
retirement plans, Health Savings Accounts, credit cards, and 
merchant payment processing. Community Banking also 
purchases sales finance contracts from retail merchants 

throughout the United States and retail installment contracts 
from auto dealers in the United States and Puerto Rico. 
Consumer and business deposit products include checking 

accounts, savings deposits, market rate accounts, Individual 
Retirement Accounts, time deposits, global remittance and debit 
cards. 

 Community Banking serves customers through a complete 
range of channels, including traditional banking stores, in-store 
banking centers, business centers, ATMs, Online and Mobile

 Wholesale Banking
 provides financial solutions to businesses 
across the United States with annual sales generally in excess of 

$20 million and to financial institutions globally. Wholesale

separate accounts and mutual

Capital Management. Wholesale Ba
nking also supports the CRE 
market with products and services such as construction loans for 
commercial and residential development, land acquisition and

interim financing arrangements for completed structures, 

rehabilitation loans, affordable housing loans and letters of 
credit, permanent loans for securitization, CRE loan servicing 
and real estate and mortgage brokerage services. 
 Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement 
provides a full range of 
financial advisory services to clients using a planning approach 

to meet each client's needs. Wealth Management provides 
affluent and high net worth clients with a complete range of 
wealth management solutions, including financial planning, 

private banking, credit, investment management and trust. 
Family Wealth (to be rebranded as Abbot Downing, a Wells 
Fargo Business, in April 2012) me
ets the unique needs of ultra 
high net worth customers. Brokerage serves customers' advisory, 
brokerage and financial needs as pa
rt of one of the largest full-
service brokerage firms in the United States. Retirement is a 
national leader in providing in
stitutional retirement and trust

related to the Wachovia merger) not specific to a business 
segment and elimination of cert
ain items that are included in 
more than one business segment.

229  Note 26: Regulatory and Ag
ency Capital Requirements 
 The Company and each of its su
bsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by 
federal regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve establishes 
capital requirements, including well capitalized standards, for 
the consolidated financial holding company, and the OCC has 

similar requirements for the Company™s national banks, 
including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 We do not consolidate our wholly-owned trust (the Trust) 

formed solely to issue trust pr
eferred and preferred purchase 
securities (the Securities). Securities issued by the Trust 

includable in Tier 1 capita
l were $7.5 billion at 
December 31, 2011. Since December 31, 2010, we have called 
$9.2 billion of trust preferred securities, and also issued 
$2.5 billion in Series I Preferred Stock, replacing certain 

preferred purchase securities reflected in the amount of 
Securities issued by the Trust includable in Tier 1 capital at 
December 31, 2010. The Series I 
Preferred Stock was included in 
preferred stock (Note 18), as a separate component of Tier 1 
capital. The junior subordinated
 debentures held by the Trust 
were included in the Com
pany™s long
-term debt. 
 Certain subsidiaries of the Company are approved 
seller/servicers, and are therefore required to maintain 

minimum levels of shareholders™ equity, as specified by various 
agencies, including the United 
States Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At 
December 31, 2011, each seller/servicer met these requirements. 
Certain broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to 
SEC Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital 
Rule), which requires that we 
maintain minimum levels of net capital, as defined. At 
December 31, 2011, each of these subsidiaries met these 
requirements.

(2) The leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, excluding goodwill and certain other i

3% for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk, excellent asset qua
lity, high liquidity, good earnings, effective 
management and monitoring of market risk and, in general, are considered top-rated, strong banking organizations.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
 Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the relate
d consolidated statements of income, chan

cash flows for each of the year
s in the three-year period ended December 31, 
2011. These consolidated financial statements are

responsibility of the 
Company™s
 management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these consolidated financial statements 
based on our audits. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of th
e Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Thos
e standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are 
free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basi
s, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the fin
ancial 
statements. An audit also includes assessin
g the accounting principles used and sign
ificant estimates made by management, as we
ll as

eve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred 
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
 position of 
the Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010
, and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for each of the years in the
 three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformi
ty with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 In 2010, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to
 its involvement with variable interest entities, and in 2009,
 the Company changed its method of evaluating other 
than temporary impairment for debt securities. 
 
We also have audited, in accordance with
 the standards of the Public Company Accoun
ting Oversight Board (United States), the 
Company™s internal control over financial reporting as 
of December 31, 2011, based 
on criteria established in

        (1) Our average prime rate was 3.25% for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The average three-month London Interbank Of
fered Rate (LIBOR) was 0.48% 
and 0.29% for the same quarters, respectively. 
(2) Yields/rates and amounts include the effects of hedge and risk ma
nagement activities associated with the respective asset and l
iability categories. 
(3) Yields and rates are based on interest income/expense amounts for the period, annualized based on the accrual basis for the res
pective accounts. The average balance 
represent amortized cost and the previously reported average ba
lance amounts for all periods prior to 2011 have been changed to
 amortized cost, the basis used to 
determine yield for those periods. 
(4) Nonaccrual loans and related income are included in their respective loan categories.
 (5) Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $191 million and $161 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, res
pectively primarily related to tax-
exempt income on certain loans and securities. The federal statutory tax rate was 35% for the periods presented.
