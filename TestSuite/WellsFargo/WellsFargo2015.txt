One of the many things that make 
Wells Fargo unique is our company™s 

rich 164-year history. Wells Fargo is one 

of a handful of U.S. companies dating 

to the mid-1800s that is still in the same 

business and operates under the same 

name. In fact, our headquarters building 

at 420 Montgomery St. in San Francisco 

stands on the same spot where Wells Fargo 

˜rst opened for business in 1852. 
You can learn more about our 
past by visiting one of Wells Fargo™s 

11 history museums across the U.S. 

However, the most powerful expression 

of our heritage isn™t in documents 

or artifacts or even our stagecoach. 

It is in any of the millions of relationships 

we have formed over generations with 

customers, team members, communities, 

and shareholders. ﬁRelationshipsﬂ de˜ne

             Earning lifelong relationships, 
one customer at a time, is fundamental 

to achieving our vision, which is to 

ﬁsatisfy our customers™ ˜nancial needs 

and help them succeed ˜nancially.ﬂ 

Whether we™re helping a student open 

a first checking account, a young 

family purchase a home, a business 

owner expand, or a retiree manage 

investments, we are on our customers™ 

side, o˚ering them the products 

and services they want and need. 

We believe the best way we can 

earn our customers™ business is 

to listen and understand their needs. 
Consider Biltmore, one of America™s 
most beautiful historic estates 

and a popular tourist attraction, 

built by George Vanderbilt in 1895 

in the Blue Ridge Mountains 

of North Carolina. At the turn 

of the 20th century, the Vanderbilt  

family used Wells Fargo for transport 

along the East Coast, and they later 

formed a banking relationship with 

us. Through listening to and working 

with The Biltmore Company, we have 

provided loans and ˜nancial services 

to help the business grow. Today, 

Biltmore draws more than 1.4 million 

visitors annually and includes not 

only an inn and hotel, but also 

a village with restaurants and retail  

shops, a winery, branded retail 

products, and a solar farm. 
Earning relationships and helping 
customers like The Biltmore Company 

are the core of our business. We are 

honored to have relationships with 

one in three U.S. households. We lend 

more money to help individuals and 

families buy homes than any other 

American company. We are the nation™s 

top lender to small businesses, based 

on Community Reinvestment Act data. 
We are the largest lender 

to mid-sized companies, and we 

help large companies with their 

domestic and global needs through 

our o˛ces in 36 countries. 
Our leading position across many 
of our businesses is important because 

it re˝ects how well we are serving our 

customers Š individuals, households, 

businesses, and corporations Š 

who make up the ﬁreal economy.ﬂ 

We never take for granted the trust 

our customers have placed in us, 

and we understand the important 

role we play in helping grow the U.S. 

economy. If we serve our customers 

well and manage our business 

e˚ectively and e˛ciently, we also 

will grow and succeed as a company. 

As we like to say, we never put the 

stagecoach ahead of the horses! 
We never take for 
granted the trust 

our customers have 

placed in us, and 

we understand the 

important role we 

play in helping grow 

the U.S. economy. 
Financial res
Our focus on customers, as well 

as our diversi˜ed business model 

and strong risk discipline, helped 

us to produce another solid year 

of ˜nancial performance in 2015, 

even as we navigated the pressures 

of low interest rates and global 

economic volatility. 
Wells Fargo generated $86.1 billion 

in revenue in 2015, up 2 percent from 

2014. Our time-tested business model 

Š which produced a balanced mix 

of net interest income and noninterest 

income across more than 90 businesses 

Š allowed us to deliver consistent 

performance despite the challenging 

environment. 
Our 2015 net income was $22.9 billion, 
and our diluted earnings per common 

share of $4.12 represented a $0.02 

increase from 2014. Our 2015 return 

on assets was 1.31 percent, and our 

return on equity was 12.60 percent. 
At year-end, our total deposits reached  
a record $1.2 trillion, up 5 percent from 

the prior year, driven by both consumer 

and commercial growth. Total loans 

finished 2015 at $916.6 billion, 

up 6 percent from 2014, making our  

loan portfolio the largest among U.S.  

banks. We saw growth in commercial 

loans, residential mortgages, credit 

cards, and automobile lending while 

maintaining our strong credit and 

pricing discipline. 
In fact, the credit quality of our 
portfolio proved to be about as good as 

I™ve seen in my 34 years at Wells Fargo. 

Credit losses of $2.9 billion improved 

2 percent from 2014. Net charge-o˚s 

as a percentage of average loans 

remained near historic lows Š 

0.33 percent in 2015, compared 

with 0.35 percent in 2014. 
We also continued to strengthen 
our balance sheet in 2015 and ended 

the year with our highest-ever levels 

of capital and liquidity. We finished 

2015 with total equity of $193.9 billion, 

Common Equity Tier 1 capital 

of $142.4 billion, and a Common  

Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in)  

of 10.77 percent.

balance sheet strength allowed us 

to return more capital to shareholders. 

In 2015, we returned $12.6 billion to our 

shareholders through common stock 

dividends and net share repurchases, 

re˝ecting the ˜fth consecutive year 

in which we returned more capital 

to shareholders than in the previous  

year. We increased our quarterly 

common stock dividend rate 

by 7 percent to $0.375 per share, 

and we repurchased 78.2 million 

shares of our common stock on 

a net basis. And we again ended 

the year as the world™s most valuable 

bank by market capitalization. 
We also continued to make 
strides in improving our company™s 

e˛ciency and reinvesting for the 

future. In addition to simplifying our 

operations, we reduced our travel 

costs by 23 percent in 2015, 

and we have eliminated more 

than 20 million square feet of 

occupied real estate since 2009.  

We™re investing those savings 

in areas such as innovation, risk 

management, and cybersecurity. 
Another bene˜t of our company™s 
consistent performance is the ability 

to be well positioned for strategic 

acquisitions to support growth. 

We were pleased to announce an 

agreement to acquire GE Capital™s 

Commercial Distribution Finance 

and Vendor Finance platforms, 

as well as a portion of its Corporate 

Finance business. We anticipate 

adding approximately $31 billion 

in assets and welcoming about 

2,900 GE Capital team members 

to Wells Fargo when the transaction 

closes. We also acquired GE Railcar 

Services, a railcar ˜nance, leasing, 

and fleet management business, 

on Jan. 1, 2016, and in the second 

quarter of 2015 we completed a GE 

Capital commercial real estate loan 

portfolio transaction, which included 

approximately $11.5 billion in loan 

purchases and related financing. 
These additions should grow  
our business and provide greater 

opportunities for us to expand 

our relationships with customers. 
Our financial performance and 

customer focus earned us external 

recognition in many ways in 2015. 

For example, we ranked No. 7 

on Barron™s
 2015 ranking of the 
world™s ﬁ100 Most Respected 

Companiesﬂ Š the fourth year in 

a row we ranked highest among 

all banks on the list.

Relationships ar
at the core of our cultur

While accolades are rewarding, 

our highest honor is the trust that 

customers place in us. And trust 

is best built through relationships. 
No document better captures 
our relationship-based culture and 

focus on customers than 
The Vision 

& Values of Wells Fargo,
 which was 

˜rst published more than 20 years 

ago. (I invite you to read our 

Vision & Values at 
wellsfargo.
Com.) We bring the 
Vision & Values
 to life 

each day through delivering on our 

six priorities: putting customers 

˜rst, growing revenue, managing 

expenses, living our vision and 

values, connecting with communities 

and stakeholders, and managing risk. 
These priorities also support 

our focus on the relationships 

with customers, team members, 

communities, and shareholders 

that are at the heart of our culture. 
Earning relationshi
with our customer

We work to make every relationship  

Š new and old Š a lasting one 

by following a few simple principles. 

We put our customers first and 

treat them as our valued guests. 

We are committed to our customers™ 

satisfaction and ˜nancial success 

and to work in their best interest. 

In short, we are on our customers™ 

side. You will read stories about 

how we do that in the following 

pages, including how we eased 

an older couple™s budgeting 

concerns and helped a customer 

navigate the used-car buying process. 
When we follow these principles, 
we gain trust and earn relationships 

that reach across decades and 

generations. Just as our customers 

trusted Wells Fargo and our 

Abbot Downing-built stagecoaches  

to transport their valuables in the 

1800s, they trust us today with their 

˜nancial needs. 
One example is the Hearst family. 
We™ve nurtured a relationship with 

the Hearsts for more than 100 years. 

George Hearst, an entrepreneur and 

mining developer, used Wells Fargo 

stagecoaches and express services 

to transport gold and silver to 

U.S. Mints, starting in the 1860s. 

His wife, Phoebe, an active investor 

and philanthropist, was a Wells Fargo 

investment services and trust customer. 

Over the years, our relationship 

with the Hearsts broadened as their 

business grew from its origins 

as a mining company and a single 

newspaper to become one 

of the world™s top private media 

and information companies 

encompassing more than 

360 businesses in 150 countries. 

We are honored to help the Hearst 

family and business grow through 

a broad assortment of products and 

services, and today our ties are as 
2015 Annual R
|                                   
  
       
                                                                                      
                            
                           
             strong and deep as ever. Wealth and 
Investment Management serves the 

family™s personal ˜nancial needs, and 

Wholesale Banking provides corporate 

services such as credit, treasury 

management, debt capital markets, 

trust, and investment banking to the 

Hearst Corporation. 
The key to earning deep 
and long-lasting relationships 

is not only knowing our customers, 

but also understanding how they 

de˜ne ˜nancial success. We have 

a sincere desire to help them succeed, 

and we do so by working across our 

many businesses to provide them 

with the products and services 

they need. 
That certainly is the case in our 
work with small business customers. 

We appreciate the important role  

that small businesses play in local 

communities and the overall 

economy. We have relationships 

with approximately 3 million U.S. 

small business owners, and in 2015, 

we were the top lender of U.S. Small 

Business Administration 7(a) loans 

in both number of loans and dollars. 

Our Wells Fargo Works
 for Small 

Business® 
initiative, launched in 2014, 
provides resources, guidance, and 

services for small business owners, 

and we are making strong progress 

on our goal to extend $100 billion 

in new lending to small businesses 

by 2018. 
One of the most rewarding aspects 
of our small business relationships 

is helping our customers grow and 

contributing to their long-term 

success. One such relationship is 

with Deschutes Brewery. We provided 

entrepreneur Gary Fish with an 

initial loan to help open a brewpub 

in Bend, Oregon, in 1998. His craft 

beer quickly caught on, and today 

Gary™s company employs 472 workers 

and is 7.9 percent employee-owned. 

As Deschutes Brewery grew, we were 

with the company every step of the way, 

providing capital, cash management, 

and a variety of advice and ancillary 

services. Now one of our Wholesale 

Banking customers, the company 

distributes beer Š with the tagline 
ﬁBorn in Bend, Oregonﬂ Š in 28 states, 

and today is one of the top 10 craft 

brewers in the U.S. ﬁWe have been with 

Wells Fargo from the very beginning,ﬂ 

Gary says. ﬁThey were the ones who 

gave us a loan to get started.ﬂ 
We are a relationship 
company, but our 

relationships with 

customers are only 

as strong as our 

relationships with 

each other. 
Earning relationshi
with our team member

We are a relationship company, 

but our relationships with customers 

are only as strong as our relationships 

with each other. Products and 

technology don™t ful˜ll the promises we 

make to our customers, our people do 

Š people who are talented, motivated, 
and, I believe, more energized than  

our competitors. 
Take Terri Steup as an example. 
Terri is a bank store manager 

in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who has 

been with our company for more 

than 40 years. Terri is a talented 

relationship builder with her team, 

and her enthusiasm is infectious. 

ﬁWe are having fun; we are a family!ﬂ 

she says about her team. Terri also 

recognizes the importance of earning 

relationships with customers. 

Understanding the community™s 

diversity, Terri™s team greets customers 

in three languages Š English, Burmese, 

and Spanish Š and Terri actively 

recruits new team members from 

among the Burmese, Vietnamese,  

and Hispanic immigrant population 

that her store serves. 
We have always believed that 
our team members are our most 

valuable resource, and we want 

them to be with us for the long 

term. We invest in them by o˚ering 

competitive salaries, professional 
training and development, leadership 

opportunities, and bene˜ts that 

include a˚ordable health care 

options, work-life balance programs, 

401(k) matching contributions,  

tuition reimbursement, and 

a discretionary pro˜t sharing plan. 
We want all our team members 
to lead by bringing our vision 

and values to life. That is a shared 

responsibility Š no matter a person™s 

position in the company. As we say 

in our 
Vision & Values
, we de˜ne 

leadership as the act of establishing, 

sharing, and communicating our 

vision, and as the art of motivating 

others to understand and embrace  

our vision. 
Since our success depends on our 
team members, we survey them each 

year to hear what they think. This is 

important because the more connected 

team members feel to the company, 

the more likely they are to form lasting 

relationships with our customers. 

In 2015, our overall team member 

ﬁengagementﬂ score continued  

to increase, measuring 4.25 out  

of a possible 5, an increase over 

our 2014 score of 4.22. The Gallup 

Organization, which conducts our 

annual surveys, named Wells Fargo 

a ﬁGallup Great Workplace Awardﬂ 

winner in 2014 and 2015, which 

distinguishes the world™s most 

engaged and productive companies. 
This recognition is rewarding in that 
it re˝ects our Culture of Caring
SM approach in the relationships our 

team members build with our 

customers and with each other. 

A key part of that approach 

is working together, using what™s 

in our hearts, not just in our heads, 

to care for and earn relationships 

with our customers. 
A recent letter from a customer 
brought home to me the power 

of relationships to change lives. 

Five years ago, this customer  

would regularly come into one 

of our Portland, Oregon, bank 

stores to cash his paychecks. 

He gradually formed a relationship 

with Store Manager Ruvim Kruzhkov.

 Ruvim realized that the customer 
needed the security of a bank 

account despite challenges with 

his credit history. He worked with  

the customer to open an Opportunity 

Checking Account, a type of account 

we created especially for customers 

with credit challenges. Over the 

years, the customer has improved 

his credit to qualify for a regular 

account, a credit card, and later 

a home mortgage and a line of credit 

for his growing business. He wrote 

to tell me, ﬁI attribute much of that 

growth to Ruvim's support over the 

years– . All I can say is that there is 

a true feeling of care at Wells Fargo.ﬂ 
We also are on our customers™ 
side when emergencies occur. 

For example, after the Memorial Day 

2015 ˝oods in the Houston area, 

our company donated $275,000 

for relief e˚orts, and our team 

members sta˚ed a specially 

designed mobile response unit 

six days a week, up to 10 hours 

a day, for customers. That allowed 

us to provide cash and mortgage 

assistance, insurance claim check 

processing, and help in starting 

the recovery process. We also  

provided grants and services 

to support disaster-relief efforts 

in other areas affected by 

devastating events such as 

wildfires in the West and in 

Alaska, the earthquake in Nepal, 

and flooding in South Carolina. 
Earning relationshi
with our c

At Wells Fargo, we earn long-term 

relationships with our communities 

by creating a positive, lasting 

connection. We are a Main Street  

bank, and we are committed 

to strengthening our communities 

through our operations, business 

practices, employment opportunities, 

philanthropy, and community 

engagement. 
Our team members volunteer their 
time and donate to nonpro˜ts and 

causes important to them. In 2015, 

Wells Fargo team members volunteered 

1.8 million hours and contributed 

$98.8 million to nonpro˜ts and schools. 
United Way Worldwide has ranked 

our workplace-giving campaign the 

largest in the U.S. each of the past 

seven years. 
In addition to the generous donations 
from our team members, Wells Fargo  

is one of the top corporate cash 

donors among U.S. companies. 

Over the past ˜ve years (2011 Œ 2015), 

Wells Fargo has donated $1.4 billion 

to support and revitalize communities, 

help charitable organizations, and 

grow local economies. 
In our communities we particularly 
focus on social, economic, and 

environmental programs and  

activities. Here are some examples: 
Social: 
We are focused on supporting 
the varied needs of our global 
customer base. One of our most 

important commitments as 

a company is to support those 

in the military who have served 

or continue to serve our country.  

Since 2012, we have donated 

more than $66 million in the form 

of assistance to nonpro˜ts, education, 

job training, and property, including 

more than 300 mortgage-free houses 

to wounded veterans and their 

families. We employ more than 

8,000 self-identi˜ed veterans and 

are committed to hiring more. 
Our long-term community 
relationship with the Metropolitan 

Economic Development Association 

(MEDA) is a terri˜c example of how 

we work with nonprofit partners 

to strengthen our communities. 

Wells Fargo co-founded MEDA 

with other business leaders in 

1971 in Minneapolis to support the 

development of minority-owned 

businesses, break down barriers, 

and provide equal economic 

opportunities. Since its start, MEDA has helped 
more than 19,000 entrepreneurs 

and assisted in the start-up 

of nearly 500 businesses. 

One of its clients, H&B Elevators,  

is a subcontractor for the 

construction of our new 

Minneapolis office buildings. 
H&B Elevators, which is African-

American owned, is providing design 

and manufacturing services for the 

buildings™ elevator cab interiors. 
We are delighted to work with 
diverse suppliers such as H&B 

Elevators and, in 2015, surpassed our 

goal of spending at least 10 percent 

of our annual procurement budget 

with diverse vendors. 
Economic: 
We are focused 
on strengthening individuals™ 
financial knowledge and 

opportunities for underserved 

communities. We continue 

to provide free ˜nancial education 

courses to thousands of military 

members, seniors, small business 

owners, and youth each year 

through Hands on Banking®, 

now in its 13th year. Homeownership 

and access to safe, sustainable 

housing continue to be critical 

community needs. Our team members 

have volunteered more than 4.7 million 

hours through the Wells Fargo 

Housing Foundation since 1993, 

mobilizing to build and rehabilitate 

nearly 5,600 homes. We also have 

long-term relationships with Habitat  

for Humanity a˛liates across the U.S. 
Additionally, our LIFT programs 
have helped create more than 

10,725 homeowners in 39 communities 

since 2012, through more than 

$278 million of down payment and

Earning relationshi
with our shareholder

We also work to build long-term 

relationships with our shareholders 

and earn their con˜dence through 

our performance over time. 
We believe that we attract 
shareholders and sustain 

relationships through the many 

long-term advantages that we o˚er 

investors, including our leading 

market share in cornerstone products; 

diversi˜ed and balanced revenue 

sources; strong risk discipline; 

experienced management team; 

and consistent culture. 
These advantages and our 
˜nancial performance have enabled 

us to continue to return more capital  

to our shareholders than in the 

previous year. I noted earlier that 

in 2015 we returned $12.6 billion 

through common stock dividends 

and net share repurchases. 
Further reinforcing the long-term 
nature of our commitment, Wells Fargo 

leads in total shareholder return among 
our bank peer group over the past 

˜ve- and 10-year periods (ended 

Dec. 31, 2015). 
Actively preparing for the futur
While we take great pride in the 

relationships we are earning today, 

and those we™ve earned over our 

history, we are hardly anchored 

to the past. The world is changing 

rapidly, and one of the ways we 

keep the customer at the center 

of all we do is by innovating. 

In addition to the six priorities 

I mentioned earlier, which 

we concentrate on daily, we have 

identi˜ed four drivers that we 

believe are critical to our 

future success: 
Creating exceptiona
customer experienc

Customer experience is at the 

core of our 
Culture of Caring
 focus, 

in how we treat our customers and 

each other. As our team members 

do their jobs, they demonstrate 

a positive and caring attitude for 

customers every day. This mindset 

is so important to our success that 

I like to say we hire for attitude and 

train for aptitude. 
Exceptional customer experiences 
also stem from a can-do mindset. 

If there™s a better way, we™ll work 

hard to ˜nd it for our customers. 

For example, we enhanced the 

account-opening process for our 

retail banking customers in 2015 

through our ﬁSteps to Better Bankingﬂ 

program. The program provides 

information about how to avoid 

service fees, explains choosing and 

setting up numerous types of text 

alerts, and o˚ers other key resources 

Š all within an hour of opening 

an account. 
A third mindset of caring for 
our customers is realizing that 

at Wells Fargo, we are better together. 

That means communicating clearly 

with our customers, such as sending 

timely alerts on account transactions. 

And we provide free retirement 

assessments and online educational 

resources such as our Smarter

In 2015, we brought together 
team members from existing 

Wells Fargo teams to form a new 

Innovation Group, a cross-functional 

organization to help keep us at 

the leading edge of technological 

innovation in financial services. 

Key focuses of the Innovation Group 

include research and development, 

payment strategies, design and 

delivery, and analytics. 
Making diversity an
inclusion part of o

As a Main Street bank, it™s critical 

that our team members re˝ect the 

makeup of our communities so 

we can better understand and serve 

the different needs of our customers. 

Our company is characterized by 

diversity Š from our board of directors  

to customer-facing team members. 

Overall, 57 percent of U.S.-based team 

members are women, and 41 percent 

are ethnically/racially diverse. 

Women head two of our four major 

businesses, and our board is among 

the most diverse in the industry 

(44 percent women and 31 percent 

ethnically/racially diverse). 
Our goals of recognizing and 
serving all customers include 

those customers with disabilities, 

and we are especially focused on 

using technology to eliminate 

accessibility barriers. We were 

the first bank to o˚er voice-enabled 

ATMs to assist our visually impaired 

customers, and these ATMs now 

speak in English and Spanish. 

We also o˚er credit and debit cards 

in Braille. 
I am delighted by the recognition 
we™ve received by outside organizations 

that monitor diversity and inclusion. 

For example, in 2015 we were 

recognized by 
DiversityInc
 as the 

No. 1 Company for LGBT Employees, 

7th Top Company for Veterans, 

and as the 11th Top Company 

for Diversity; and by 
LATINA Style 

as the 8th Best Company for Latinas. 

Additionally, we received a perfect 
score of 100 percent on the 2016 

Corporate Equality Index, a national 

benchmarking survey and report 

on corporate policies and practices 

related to LGBT workplace equality. 

This is the 13th consecutive year 

that Wells Fargo has earned 

a 100 percent score. 
At Wells Fargo, 
every team member 

is responsible for 

managing risk. 
Leading the way in risk managem
and operational excellenc

E˚ective risk management practices 

help us better serve our customers, 

maintain and improve our position 

in the market, and protect the 

long-term safety, soundness, 

and reputation of Wells Fargo. 

We understand that trust is the 

core of any meaningful relationship. 

At Wells Fargo, every team member 

is responsible for managing risk. 
Protecting our customers™ assets 
and providing ˜nancial security 

are key principles in our risk-focused 

culture. We continue to invest heavily 

in risk management and information 

security to meet our goals of protecting 

our customers™ information and 

assets, safeguarding our infrastructure 

and systems, and setting the global 

standard for risk management 

excellence among ˜nancial institutions. 
Operational excellence is part 
of our 
Vision & Values
 and is a 

key driver in the value we provide 

shareholders. We apply it at every 

level of the company, focusing on 

creating sustainable improvement 

for our business, enhancing the 

customer experience, mitigating 

risk, and increasing e˛ciency.

Our Annual Report would not 

be complete without recognizing 

the hard work of our board 

of directors. Their knowledge, 

experience, and leadership are 
integral to Wells Fargo™s success. 

I want to acknowledge Judy Runstad, 

who will be retiring from the board 

at our annual meeting of stockholders 

in April. Judy joined our board in 

1998, and she has been an outstanding 

director. We will miss her many 

contributions, and I thank her 

for her service. 
As our company moves forward, 
we will continue to focus on earning 

and building lifelong relationships. 

That is how we have done business 

for the past 164 years, and that focus 

is at the heart of our culture. 
I am thankful for the leadership 
of 265,000 team members who are

John Martinelli In 1859, Stephen G. Martinelli moved 
from Switzerland to California™s fertile 

Central Coast, where his brother had 

started farming apples a few years  

earlier. Because they didn™t have a way  

to preserve apple juice, Stephen started  

to experiment with hard apple cider  

and developed an e˚ervescent version. 
Today, Stephen™s great-grandson,  
John, runs S. Martinelli & Company,  

a Wells Fargo customer best known  

for Martinelli™s Gold Medal apple juice 

and nonalcoholic sparkling ciders. 
ﬁMy grandfather, Stephen G. Martinelli 
Jr., also was a pioneer. A couple  

years before Prohibition would have 

rendered our primary product illegal,  

he developed a pasteurization process  

to preserve apple juice products,ﬂ  

said John. ﬁIf it wasn™t for his work,  

we wouldn™t have been able to transition

which is now our No. 1 product.ﬂ

John said, ﬁWells Fargo has helped

including property purchases,  

buildings, bottling equipment,  

and apple presses, as well as  

working capital needs.ﬂ 
As S. Martinelli & Company  
looks to vertically integrate and  

expand its operations, Wells Fargo  

has been a valuable consultant. 

Relationship Manager Ryan

As a physical therapist who sees patients

In his quest to ˜nd the best used  
vehicle, Shyam credits Wells Fargo™s  

Kyle Fleeger, an auto-loan sales 

consultant, who helped at every step 

along the way. Shyam said he even  

called Kyle while he was on the road, 

shopping for a car, to check on pricing 

and the vehicle™s value, and ultimately  

to make sure his preapproval would  

cover the car he was considering. 
ﬁIt was very convenient for me,  
given that I work long hours and  

have to travel all over for my job.  

It was great working with Kyle  

on the phone,ﬂ said Shyam. 
Shyam™s ˜rst priority was to ˜nd  
a way to a˚ord a second vehicle.  
So Kyle helped him re˜nance his  

SUV loan and save enough money  

to make another vehicle possible.  

Shyam, who lives in Fort Lauderdale,

communication plans, including 

informational sessions for employees

from corporate o˛ces to barrel-making 

facilities to vineyards. Some sessions

Andrew Simon, Brown-Forman™s

retirement planning was important.ﬂ 
That, plus enhanced plan options

challenged neighborhoods, residents  

and community groups have teamed  

up to change its reputation. 
ﬁAs the westernmost neighborhood  
of the city, Austin is the gateway  

to Chicago for many,ﬂ said Darnell 

Shields of the nonpro˜t Austin 

Coming Together. ﬁWe want to live  

up to the greatness of our city.ﬂ 
One focus is on improving 
student success in third grade, a key 

indicator of educational advancement. 

But instead of looking solely at student 

achievement, organizers are taking  

a long-term, comprehensive approach  

Š understanding that preparing kids  

for success in school starts with 

access to quality day care, economic 

opportunities for family members, 

and a safe neighborhood. 
Wells Fargo has joined the e˚ort, 
donating $300,000 to United Way  

of Metropolitan Chicago™s  
Wendy DuBoe, Lisa Johnson,  
and Darnell Shields 
Neighborhood Network Initiative,  
which supports the work of more than  

60 community organizations in Austin, 

led by Austin Coming Together.ˆ 
ﬁWe want to make a real di˚erence  
in Austin,ﬂ said Lisa Johnson,  

Wells Fargo Commercial Banking 

Midwest division manager. ﬁBuilding  

up this community is one way we can 

bring to life everything we value  

as a company.ﬂ 
And aside from ˜nancial support,  
Wells Fargo team members also  

actively volunteer Š at Austin  

schools, health care providers,  

food banks, job readiness programs,  

and more. In fact, local team members 

have selected the neighborhood  

as the bene˜ciary of a majority  

of their philanthropic and  

community support e˚orts.

our core loan portfolios increased $62.8 billion from the prior year. Our core loan portfolio growth included $11.5 billion from 
the GE Capital commercial real estate loan purchase and related 
financing transaction announced in first quarter 2015. We grew 
our investment securities portfolio by $34.6 billion in 2015 and 
our federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale 
agreements and other short-term investments (collectively 
referred to as federal funds sold and other short-term 
investments elsewhere in this Report) increased by $11.7 billion, 
or 5%, during the year. While we believe our liquidity position 
continued to remain strong with increased regulatory 
expectations, we have added to our position over the past year.The strength of our balance sheet during 2015 positioned us for the agreement we announced in third quarter 2015 to 
purchase GE Capital's Commercial Distribution Finance and 
Vendor Finance businesses as well as a portion of its Corporate 
Finance business Œ an acquisition that will help us serve more 
markets and meet more of our customers' financial needs. The 
acquisition is expected to include total assets of approximately 
$31 billion and is expected to close in two phases. The North 
American portion, which represents approximately 90% of total 
assets to be acquired, is expected to close late in first quarter 
2016. The international portion is expected to close in second 
quarter 2016. Also, in January 2016 we closed our purchase of 
GE Railcar Services, which included $4.0 billion of operating 
and capital leases, comprised of 77,000 railcars and just over 
1,000 locomotives that were added to our existing First Union 
Rail business. During fourth quarter 2015 we issued long-term 
debt to partially fund the anticipated closing of these GE Capital 
acquisitions. Deposit growth remained strong with period-end deposits up $55.0 billion from 2014. This increase reflected solid growth 
across both our commercial and consumer businesses. We grew 
our primary consumer checking customers by 5.6% and primary 
small business and business banking checking customers by 
4.8% from a year ago (November 2015 compared with November 
2014). Our ability to grow primary customers is important to our 
results because these customers have more interactions with us 
and are significantly more profitable than non-primary 
customers.Credit QualityCredit quality remained strong in 2015, demonstrating the 
benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Solid performance in 
several of our commercial and consumer loan portfolios was 
evidenced by losses remaining near historically low levels, 
reflecting our long-term risk focus. Net charge-offs of 
$2.9 billion were 0.33% of average loans, down 2 basis points 
from a year ago. Net losses in our commercial portfolio were 
$387 million, or 9 basis points of average loans. Net consumer 
losses declined to 55 basis points in 2015 from 65 basis points in 
2014. Our commercial real estate portfolios were in a net 
recovery position for each quarter of the last three years, 
reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improved market 
conditions. Losses on our consumer real estate portfolios 
declined $497 million, or 44%, from a year ago. The consumer 
loss levels reflected the benefit of the improving housing market 
and our continued focus on originating high quality loans. 
Approximately 67% of the consumer first mortgage portfolio was 
originated after 2008, when new underwriting standards were 
implemented.Our provision for credit losses in 2015 was $2.4 billion compared with $1.4 billion a year ago reflecting a release of $450 million from the allowance for credit losses, comparedwith 

a release of $1.6 billion a year ago. We did not release or build 
our allowance in the last half of 2015 as the credit improvement 
in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher 
commercial allowance reflecting deterioration in our oil and gas 
portfolio. Total loans in the oil and gas portfolio were down 6% 
from a year ago and are now less than 2% of our total loans 
outstanding. Approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance at 
December 31, 2015 was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio; 
however the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses 
inherent in the total loan portfolio. If oil prices remain low for a 
prolonged period of time, there could be additional performance 
deterioration in our oil and gas portfolio resulting in higher 
criticized assets, nonperforming loans, allowance levels and 
ultimately credit losses. Deteriorated performance can take the 
form of increased downgrades, borrower defaults, potentially 
higher commitment drawdowns prior to default, and 
downgraded borrowers being unable to fully access the capital 
markets. Furthermore, our loan exposure in communities where 
the employment base has a concentration in the oil and gas 
sector may experience some credit challenges.Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance 
and general economic conditions.In addition to lower net charge-offs, nonperforming assets (NPAs) through the end of 2015 have declined for 13 consecutive 
quarters and were down $2.7 billion, or 17%, from 2014. 
Nonaccrual loans declined $1.5 billion from the prior year while 
foreclosed assets were down $1.2 billion from 2014. CapitalOur capital levels remained strong in 2015, even as we returned more capital to our shareholders, with total equity increasing to 
$193.9 billion at December 31, 2015, up $8.6 billion from the 
prior year. We returned $12.6 billion to shareholders in 2015 
($12.5 billion in 2014) through common stock dividends and net 
share repurchases and our net payout ratio (which is the ratio of 
(i)common stock dividends and share repurchases less

issuances and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii)
net income applicable to common stock) was 59%. During 2015
we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 7% to
$0.375 per share. In 2015, our common shares outstanding
declined by 78.2 million shares as we continued to reduce our
common share count through the repurchase of 163.4 million
common shares during the year. We also entered into a 

$500million forward repurchase contract with an unrelated 

thirdparty in December 2015 that settled in January 2016 for 

9.2million shares. In addition, we entered into a $750 million

forward repurchase contract with an unrelated third party in
January 2016 that settled in first quarter 2016 for 15.9 million
shares. We expect our share count to continue to decline in 2016
as a result of anticipated net share repurchases.We believe an important measure of our capital strength is the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis, which increased to 10.77% in 2015 from 10.43% a year ago. Likewise, 

our other regulatory capital ratios remained strong. See the 
ﬁCapital Managementﬂ section in this Report for more 
information regarding our capital, including the calculation of 
our regulatory capital amounts.31                      Stock Performance˙
