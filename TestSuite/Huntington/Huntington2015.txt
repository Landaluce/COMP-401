PART I
When we refer to ﬁweﬂ, ﬁourﬂ, and ﬁusﬂ in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to the parent company, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When w
e refer to the ﬁBankﬂ in this report, we mean our only bank subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank, and its subsidiaries.
Item 1: BusinessWe are a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in 
Columbus, Ohio. We have 12,243 average full-time equivalent employees. Through the Bank, we have 150 years of serving the 

financial needs of our customers. We provide full-service commercial, small business, consumer, and mortgage banking services, 

as well as automobile financing, equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, brokerage services, insurance 
programs, and other financial products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is our only bank subsidiary. At December 31, 

2015, the Bank had 15 private client group offices and 762 branches as follows:
 Ł    406 branches in Ohio  Ł    45 branches in IndianaŁ    222 branches in Michigan  Ł    31 branches in West VirginiaŁ    48 branches in Pennsylvania  Ł    10 branches in KentuckySelect financial services and other activities are also conducted in various other states. International banking services are available through the headquarters office in Columbus, Ohio, and a limited purpose office located in the Cayman Islands. Our 

foreign banking activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant.
Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. For each of our five business segments, we expect the combination of our business model and exceptional service to provide a competitive advantage that supports revenue and earnings growth. Our business model emphasizes the 
delivery of a complete set of banking products and services offered by larger banks, but distinguished by local delivery and 

customer service.A key strategic emphasis has been for our business segments to operate in cooperation to provide products and services to 
our customers and to build stronger and more profitable relationships using our OCR sales and service process. The objectives o
f OCR are to:1. Provide a consultative sales approach to provide solutions that are specific to each customer.

2. Leverage each business segment in terms of its products and expertise to benefit customers.

3. Target prospects who may want to have multiple products and services as part of their relationship with us.
Following is a description of our five business segments and a Treasury / Other function:
Ł Retail and Business Banking
 Œ The Retail and Business Banking segment provides a wide array of financial products 
and services to consumer and small business customers including but not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, 
money market accounts, certificates of deposit, consumer loans, and small business loans. Other financial services 
available to consumer and small business customers include investments, insurance, interest rate risk protection, foreign 
exchange, and treasury management. Huntington serves customers primarily through our network of branches in Ohio, 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky. In addition to our extensive branch network, customers 

can access Huntington through online banking, mobile banking, telephone banking, and ATMs.
Huntington has established a "Fair Play" banking philosophy; providing differentiated products and services, built 
on a strong foundation of customer advocacy.  Our brand resonates with consumers and is earning us more new customers 

and deeper relationships with our current customers.Business Banking is a dynamic part of our business and we are committed to being the bank of choice for small businesses in our markets. Business Banking is defined as serving companies with revenues up to $20 million and 
consists of approximately 165,000 businesses. Huntington continues to develop products and services that are designed 
specifically to meet the needs of small business and look for ways to help companies find solutions to their financing 
needs.9Ł Commercial Banking
: Through a relationship banking model, this segment provides a wide array of products and 
services to the middle market, large corporate, and government public sector customers located primarily within our 

geographic footprint. The segment is divided into seven business units: middle market, large corporate, specialty banking, 

asset finance, capital markets, treasury management, and insurance. Middle Market Banking primarily focuses on providing banking solutions to companies with annual revenues of $20 million to $500 million. Through a relationship management approach, various products, capabilities and solutions 

are seamlessly delivered in a client centric way.
Corporate Banking works with larger, often more complex companies with revenues greater than $500 million. 
These entities, many of which are publicly traded, require a different and customized approach to their banking needs.
Specialty Banking offers tailored products and services to select industries that have a foothold in the Midwest. 
Each banking team is comprised of industry experts with a dynamic understanding of the market and industry. Many of 

these industries are experiencing tremendous change, which creates opportunities for Huntington to leverage our expertise 
and help clients navigate, adapt, and succeed.Asset Finance business is a combination of our Equipment Finance, Public Capital, Asset Based Lending, 
Technology and Healthcare Equipment Leasing, and Lender Finance divisions that focus on providing financing solutions 

against these respective asset classes.Capital Markets has two distinct product capabilities: corporate risk management services and institutional sales, trading, and underwriting. The Capital Markets Group offers a full suite of risk management tools including commodities, 

foreign exchange, and interest rate hedging services. The Institutional Sales, Trading & Underwriting team provides 

access to capital and investment solutions for both municipal and corporate institutions.Treasury Management teams help businesses manage their working capital programs and reduce expenses. Our 
liquidity solutions help customers save and invest wisely, while our payables and receivables capabilities help them 

manage purchases and the receipt of payments for goods and services. All of this is provided while helping customers take 

a sophisticated approach to managing their overhead, inventory, equipment, and labor.
Insurance brokerage business specializes in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, personal lines, 
life and disability and specialty lines of insurance. The group also provides brokerage and agency services for residential 

and commercial title insurance and excess and surplus product lines of insurance. As an agent and broker, this business 

does not assume underwriting risks but alternatively provides our customers with quality, noninvestment insurance 

contracts.Ł Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate:
 This segment provides lending and other banking products and 
services to customers outside of our traditional retail and commercial banking segments. Our products and services 
include providing financing for the purchase of vehicles by customers at franchised automotive dealerships, financing the 
acquisition of new and used vehicle inventory of franchised automotive dealerships, and financing for land, buildings, and 
other commercial real estate owned or constructed by real estate developers, automobile dealerships, or other customers 
with real estate project financing needs. Products and services are delivered through highly specialized relationship-
focused bankers and product partners. Huntington creates well-defined relationship plans which identify needs where 
solutions are developed and customer commitments are obtained.The Automotive Finance team services automobile dealerships, its owners, and consumers buying automobiles 
through these franchised dealerships. Huntington has provided new and used automobile financing and dealer services 
throughout the Midwest since the early 1950s. This consistency in the market and our focus on working with strong 

dealerships has allowed us to expand into selected markets outside of the Midwest and to actively deepen relationships 
while building a strong reputation.The Commercial Real Estate team serves real estate developers, REITs, and other customers with lending needs that 
are secured by commercial properties. Most of these customers are located within our footprint.Within Commercial Real Estate, Huntington Community Development focuses on improving the quality of life for 
our communities and the residents of low-to moderate-income neighborhoods by developing and delivering innovative 
products and services to support affordable housing and neighborhood stabilization. 
Ł Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group:  
Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client 
Group is well positioned competitively as we have closely aligned with our eleven regional banking markets. A 

fundamental point of differentiation is our commitment to be actively engaged within our local markets - building 
10connections with community and business leaders and offering a uniquely personal experience delivered by colleagues 
working within those markets.The Huntington Private Client Group is organized into units consisting of The Huntington Private Bank, The 
Huntington Trust, and The Huntington Investment Company.  Our private banking, trust, and investment functions focus 

their efforts in our Midwest footprint and Florida.
The Huntington Private Bank provides high net-worth customers with deposit, lending (including specialized lending options), and banking services.The Huntington Trust also serves high net-worth customers and delivers wealth management and legacy planning 
through investment and portfolio management, fiduciary administration, trust services, and trust operations.  This group 

also provides retirement plan services and corporate trust to businesses and municipalities.The Huntington Investment Company, a dually registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser, employs 
representatives who work with our Retail and Private Bank to provide investment solutions for our customers.  This team 

offers a wide range of products and services, including brokerage, annuities, advisory, and other investment products. 
Huntington sold HAA, HASI, and Unified in the 2015 fourth quarter. 
Ł Home Lending: Home Lending originates and services consumer loans and mortgages for customers who are generally located in our primary banking markets. Consumer and mortgage lending products are primarily distributed through the 
Retail and Business Banking segment, as well as through commissioned loan originators. Home Lending earns interest on 
loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, earns fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage loans, and 
recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. Home Lending supports the origination and servicing of 
mortgage loans across all segments.The Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense.

The financial results for each of these business segments are included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are discussed in the Business Segment Discussion of our MD&A.Pending Acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation
On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based 
FirstMerit Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction 

expected to be valued at approximately $3.4 billion based on the closing stock price on the day preceding the announcement.  
FirstMerit Corporation is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, which reported assets of 

approximately $25.5 billion based on their December 31, 2015 unaudited balance sheet, and 366 banking offices and 400 ATM 

locations in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.  First Merit Corporation provides a complete range of banki
ng and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its core operations.  Principal affiliates include: FirstMerit
 Bank, N.A. and First Merit Mortgage Corporation.  Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit Corporation will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of FirstMerit Corporation common stock.  The transaction is expected to be completed in 
the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approva
l of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation.  CompetitionWe compete with other banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, and finance and 
trust companies, as well as mortgage banking companies, automobile and equipment financing companies (including captive 
automobile finance companies), insurance companies, mutual funds, investment advisors, and brokerage firms, both within and 
outside of our primary market areas. Internet companies are also providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong, competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers.We compete for loans primarily on the basis of a combination of value and service by building customer relationships as a 
result of addressing our customers™ entire suite of banking needs, demonstrating expertise, and providing convenience to our 

customers. We also consider the competitive pricing pressures in each of our markets.
We compete for deposits similarly on a basis of a combination of value and service and by providing convenience through a 
banking network of branches and ATMs within our markets and our website at www.huntington.com. We have also instituted 
11customer friendly practices, such as our 24-Hour Grace® account feature, which gives customers an additional business day to cover overdrafts to their consumer account without being charged overdraft fees.

Source: FDIC.gov, based on June 30, 2015 survey.Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery systems, consolidation among financial service providers, bank failures, and the conversion of certain former investment banks to bank holding companies.Financial Technology, or FinTech, startups are emerging in key areas of banking.  In response, we are monitoring activity in 
marketplace lending along with businesses engaged in money transfer, investment advice, and money management tools. Our 

strategy involves assessing the marketplace, determining our near term plan, while developing a longer term approach to 
effectively service our existing customers and attract new customers. This includes evaluating which products we develop in-

house, as well as evaluating partnership options where applicable. Regulatory MattersWe are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB, and other federal and state regulators.
Because we are a public company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC. The SEC has established five categories of 
issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a large acceler
ated filer and, as such, must comply with SEC accelerated reporting requirements.The banking industry is highly regulated.  We and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations that
 govern many aspects of our operations and limit the businesses in which we may engage. These laws and regulations may change 

from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund, the stability of the financial system in the United States, and the health of the national economy, and are not designed primarily to benefit
 or protect our shareholders or creditors.The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of the activities regulated by the banking laws and regulations applicable to us or our Bank or the impact of such laws and regulations on us or the Bank.  Changes in applicable laws or 
regulations, and in their interpretation and application by the bank regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted and may have a 
material effect on our business and results.
We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve and qualify for and have elected to become a 
financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLBA"). We are subject to examination, regulation, and 

supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports and other 

information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of 12non-depository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository institution(s). The ratings assigned to us, like thos
e assigned to other financial institutions, are confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the extent required by law.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion, we are 
subject to certain enhanced prudential standards.  As a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and require
ments than those applicable to smaller institutions, including with respect to capital requirements, leverage limits, and stress testing. The Federal Reserve has issued supervisory guidance which sets forth an updated framework for the consolidated supervision of large
 financial institutions, including bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The objectives of the
 framework are to enhance the resilience of a firm, lower the probability of its failure, and reduce the impact on the financial system in the event of an institution™s failure. With regard to resiliency, each firm is expected to ensure that the consolidated orga
nization and its core business lines can survive under a broad range of internal or external stresses. This requires financial resilienc
e by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity, and operational resilience by maintaining effective corporate governance, risk 

management, and recovery planning. With respect to lowering the probability of failure, each firm is expected to ensure the 

sustainability of its critical operations and banking offices under a broad range of internal or external stresses. This requir
es, among other things, that we have robust, forward-looking capital-planning processes that account for our unique risks.The Bank, which is chartered by the OCC, is a national bank and our only bank subsidiary. It is subject to comprehensive 
examination, regulation and supervision primarily by the OCC and, with respect to Federal consumer protection laws, by the 
CFPB, which was established by the Dodd-Frank Act.  In addition, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is 

subject to certain rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve.  As a FDIC member, the Bank is subject to deposit insurance 

assessments payable to the Deposit Insurance Fund and various FDIC requirements.  The National Bank Act and the OCC 

regulations primarily govern the Bank™s permissible activities, capital requirements, branching, dividend limitations, investme
nts, loans, and other matters.  Our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve or, 
in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. All subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the CF
PB to the extent they offer any consumer financial products or services. Our subsidiaries may be subject to examination by other 

federal and state regulators, including, in the case of certain securities and investment management activities, regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
In September 2014, the OCC published final guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including national banks with $50 billion or more in average total consolidated assets, s
uch as the Bank. The guidelines became effective November 10, 2014, and require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written 

governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions™ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. Given its size and the phased implementation 

schedule, the Bank is subject to these heightened standards effective May 2016. As discussed in Item 1A: Risk Factors, the Bank
 currently has a written governance framework and associated controls.Legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant impacts throughout the financial services industry.
The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, is complex and broad in scope and several of its provisions are still being 
implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer 

financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securitie
s regulatory agencies, implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial 
institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions, and 
restricted certain proprietary trading, and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Fr
ank Act also required the issuance of numerous implementing regulations, many of which have not yet been issued. The regulations will 

continue to take effect over several more years, continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us, our cu
stomers, or the financial industry in general.On October 3, 2015, the CFPB™s final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act became effective.   On January 1, 2016, most requirements of the OCC™s Final Rule in Loans in 

Areas Having Special Flood Hazards (the Flood Final Rule) became effective, including the requirement that flood insurance 

premiums and fees for most mortgage loans be escrowed subject to certain exceptions. The Flood Final Rule also incorporated 

other existing flood insurance requirements and exceptions (e.g. the exemption from flood insurance requirements for non-
residential detached structures - a discretionary item) with those portions of the Flood Final Rule becoming effective on Octob
er 1, 2015.    We continue to monitor, evaluate, and implement these new regulations.
Throughout 2015, the CFPB continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders. This focus led to 
some lenders to enter into consent orders with the CFPB and Department of Justice. Indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the CFPB to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers. Finally, the CFPB has implemented its 
13larger participant rule for indirect automobile lending which brings larger non-bank indirect automobile lenders under CFPB 
supervision.Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to 
take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP) by banks under standards 
developed many years ago by the Federal Trade Commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the
 scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law.  The Dodd-Frank Act also gave to the CFPB similar authority to take action
 in connection with unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) by entities subject to CFPB supervisory or enforceme
nt authority.  Banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of ﬁabusiveﬂ practices.
Financial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new Military Lending Act (MLA) final rules 
issued by the Department of Defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after October 3, 2016.  The new rul
es dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the MLA and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial
 services companies than under the previous rules. On July 10, 2015, the Federal Communication Commission, interpreting the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, issued an 
Omnibus Declaratory Ruling and Order that, among other things, restricted the use of automated telephone dialing machines.  The
 ruling effectively increases the cost of collecting debts as well as increases the litigation risk associated with the use of a
uto-dialers.Large bank holding companies and national banks are required to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve and OCC, respectively, and conduct stress tests.
The Federal Reserve™s Regulation Y requires large bank holding companies to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on 
an annual basis and requires such bank holding companies to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve under certain 
circumstances before making a capital distribution. This rule applies to us and all other bank holding companies with $50 billi
on or more of total consolidated assets.A large bank holding company™s capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over at 
least the next nine quarters, a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon, a detailed description of the entity™s process for assessing capital adequacy, the entity™s capital policy, and a discussion of any expected changes to the b
ank holding company™s business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the firm™s capital adequacy or liquidity. The plan
ning horizon for the most recently completed capital planning and stress testing cycle encompasses the 2014 fourth quarter through the 2016 fourth quarter as was submitted in our capital plan in January 2015. Rules to implement the Basel III capital reforms in the United States were finalized in July 2013 and are being phased-in by us beginning with 1Q 2015 results under the standardized 
approach.  Capital adequacy at large banking organizations, including us, is assessed against a minimum 4.5% CET1 ratio and a 

4% tier 1 leverage ratio as determined by the Federal Reserve.Capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2016, and the Federal Reserve will 
either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice of non-objection, no later than June 30, 2016. We intend to submit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2016. There can be no assurance that the Fede
ral Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stress test and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock 
repurchases.In addition to the CCAR submission, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that national banks, like The Huntington 
National Bank, conduct annual stress tests for submission beginning in January 2015. The results of the stress tests will provi
de the OCC with forward-looking information that will be used in bank supervision and will assist the agency in assessing a company™s 

risk profile and capital adequacy. We submitted our stress test results to the OCC in January 2015.  We intend to submit our 20
16 capital plan to the OCC on or before April 5, 2016. 
The regulatory capital rules indicate that common stockholders™ equity should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital  
and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the ratio of 

common equity tier 1 to risk-weighted assets became significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in tier 1 capital and an indication of the quality of capital in accordance with their requirements.Conforming Covered Activities to implement the Volcker Rule.
On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and established July 21, 2015, as the end of the conformance perio
d. Section 619 generally prohibits an insured depository institution, any company that controls an insured depository institution (such 14as a bank holding company), and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "banking entities") from engaging in sh
ort-term proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund ("covered funds"). These prohibitions are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, 

restrictions, and definitions. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced it acted under Section 619 to give banking 
entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (ﬁlegacy covered fundsﬂ). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to act this year to grant
 banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with legacy covered funds. The Bank continues its ﬁgood faithﬂ efforts to conform with proprietary trading 

prohibitions and associated compliance requirements. The Company does not expect Volcker compliance to have a material impact 

on its business model.The Volcker Rule's prohibitions impact the ability of U.S. banking entities to provide investment management products and 
services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with non-U.S. banking organizations in overseas markets. The 

rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instrument
s other than those specifically permitted for trading.The final Volcker Rule regulations do provide certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting, 
market-making, and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations, as well as various exemptions and exclusions 
from the definition of ﬁcovered fundsﬂ. The level of required compliance activity depends on the size of the banking entity and
 the extent of its trading. CEOs of larger banking entities, including Huntington, have to attest annually in writing that their 

organization has in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test, and modify compliance with the Volcker Rule 

regulations. Banking entities with significant permitted trading operations will have to report certain quantitative information, beginning between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2016, depending on the size of the banking entity™s trading assets and 

liabilities.On January 14, 2014, the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of the Volcker 
Rule. Under the interim final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met. In addition, the agencies released a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule. At December 31, 2015, we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred securities. Sev
en of our pools are included in the list of non-exclusive issuers. We have analyzed the other pool that was not included on the list 
and believe that we will continue to be able to own this investment under the final Volcker Rule regulations.
There are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the holding company. 

Regulatory approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits or if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or common stock. The Bank is currently able to p
ay dividends to the holding company subject to these limitations.If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage i
n, an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such 
practice. Depending on the financial condition of the Bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay dividends to the holding company.
The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may prohibit or limit 
bank holding companies from making capital distributions, including payment of preferred and common dividends, as part of the annual capital plan approval process.We are subject to the current capital requirements mandated by the Federal Reserve and Basel III capital and liquidity 
frameworks.The Federal Reserve sets risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio 
test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-ba
lance sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio represents total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital d
ivided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.
15In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted final capital rules implementing Basel III requirements for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and implement in the United States the Base
l III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking 
organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity 

tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all
 supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and include
s a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. These new minimum capital ratios were effective for us on January 1, 2015, and will be fully 

phased-in on January 1, 2019.The following are the Basel III regulatory capital levels that we must satisfy to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the applicable transition period, from January 1, 2015, until January 1, 2019: Basel III Regulatory Capital LevelsJanuary 1,2015January 1,2016January 1,2017January 1,2018January 1,2019Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio4.5%5.125%5.75%6.375%7.0%

Total risk-based capital ratio8.0%8.625%9.25%9.875%10.5%
The final rule emphasizes CET1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital, and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rule also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance ri
sk sensitivity. Banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets.
Based on the final Basel III rule, banking organizations with more than $15 billion in total consolidated assets are required t
o phase-out of additional tier 1 capital any non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares) issued before September 12, 2010. We began the additional tier 1 capital phase-out of our trust preferred 

securities in 2015, but will be able to include these instruments in tier 2 capital as a non-advanced approaches institution.Under Basel III, CET1 predominantly includes common stockholders™ equity, less certain deductions for goodwill and other 
intangible assets net of related taxes, over-funded net pension fund assets, and DTAs that arise from tax loss and credit 

carryforwards.  We elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from CET1 as permitted in the final rule. Tier 1 

capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 as well as perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests.  Total capit
al predominantly includes tier 1 capital as well as certain long-term debt and allowance for credit losses qualifying for tier 2 capital. The calculations of CET1, tier 1 capital, and tier 2 capital include phase-out periods for certain instruments from January 2015 through December 2017.  The primary items subject to the phase-out from capital for us are other intangible assets, DTAs that a
rise from tax loss and credit carryforwards, and trust preferred securities.Risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach are generally based on supervisory risk weightings that vary 
only by counterparty type and asset class. The revisions to supervisory risk weightings for Basel III enhance risk sensitivity 
and include alternatives to the use of credit ratings when calculating the risk weight for certain assets. Specifically, Basel III 
includes a more risk-sensitive treatment for past due and nonaccrual loans, certain commercial loans, MSRs, and certain unfunded 
commitments.  Basel III also prescribes a new formulaic approach for calculating the risk weight of securitization exposures that is also more risk sensitive.Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the
 regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under Prompt Corrective Action as applicable to under-

capitalized institutions.The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank™s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank™s 

capital due to changes in interest rates. These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describi
ng prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk 
management activities by senior management.16FDICIA requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take Prompt Corrective Action with respect to depository 
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well-

capitalized, adequately-capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized.
Throughout 2015, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions. An institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it meets or exceeds the well-capitalized minimums 
listed below, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any 
capital measure.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash 
dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would become under-capitalized afte
r such payment. Under-capitalized institutions are also subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal
 banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan.Depending upon the severity of the under capitalization, the under-capitalized institutions may be subject to a number of 
requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately-capitalized, requirements 
to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on making any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. Critically under-capitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or 

conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.Under FDICIA, a well-capitalized bank may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval.  A depository 
institution that is not well-capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates o
n deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. Since the Bank is well-capitalized, the FDICIA brokered deposit rule di
d not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $2.9 billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2
015.On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the U.S. version of the Basel Committee's minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250
 billion or more, and a less stringent modified LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain an amount of 

unencumbered HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario. We are covered by the 

modified LCR requirement and therefore subject to the initial phase-in of the rule beginning in January 2016, with the requirement fully phased-in January 2017. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly.  The modified LCR is a minimum 

requirement, and the Federal Reserve can impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matter.
We are required to submit annual resolution plans
As a bank holding company with greater than $50 billion of assets, we are required annually to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company in the event of material financial distress or failure.  If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that our plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose on us more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity 

requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations.17The FDIC separately has adopted a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank, to submit periodically to the FDIC a resolution plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure. The FDIC rule requires each covered institution to provide a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC as receiv
er to resolve the institution in an orderly manner that enables prompt access of insured deposits; maximizes the return from the failed institution™s assets; and minimizes losses realized by creditors and the Deposit Insurance Fund.   
We filed our resolution plans pursuant to each rule in December 2015.
As a bank holding company, we must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its 
subsidiary banks and must commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a bank 

holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. It may charge the bank holding company with 

engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding company™s ability to commit resources to
 such subsidiary bank.Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company™s bankruptcy, an appointed bankruptcy trustee will
 assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. 
Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over 

the claims of the institution™s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro-rata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in such national bank™s capital stock. This statute also provi
des for the enforcement of any such pro-rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment. As the 
sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions.Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims of holders 
of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an 
institution, including the holders of the institution™s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of su
ch institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank.Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are restricted.
Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank™s bank holding company and certain companies the bank holding company may be 

deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm™s-length terms, and cannot exceed
 certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank™s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or
 other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affi
liate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the bank holding company may be required to provide it.
Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of (i) the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund 
having any bank or BHC-affiliated company as an investment advisor, (ii) credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the 

acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collatera
lization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing 
transactions, and (iii) transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issu
ed debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secur
ed in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. They also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdle
s required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. While these provisions became effective 
on July 21, 2012, the Federal Reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them.As a financial holding company, we are subject to additional laws and regulations.
As a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in, and affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader 
range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company.  In order to maintain our status as a financi
al holding company, we and the Bank must each remain ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell-managed.ﬂ  In addition, the Bank must receive 
18a Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") rating of at least ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ at its most recent examination for us to engage in the f
ull range of activities permissible for financial holding companies.  Pursuant to CRA, the OCC examines the Bank to assess the 
Bank™s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank and assigns a rating based on that assessment. 

The CRA assessment and rating is reviewed by the Federal Reserve in evaluating a variety of applications including to merge or 

consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of other institutions, or to open or relocate a branch office.
Financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are specified in the Bank Holding Company Act or 
determined by the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to
 an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity, provided that the complementary activity does n
ot pose a safety and soundness risk. In addition, we are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval 

prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, we w
ould own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act added a new provision to the Bank Holding 

Company Act, which requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to obtai
n prior approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire a nondepository company having total consolidated assets of $10 billion or 
more.We also must comply with anti-money laundering and customer privacy regulations, as well as corporate governance, 
accounting, and reporting requirements.The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain 
other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger 

applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The Financial C
rimes Enforcement Network has proposed a rule for those same entities, and, if adopted, the proposal will prescribe customer due 
diligence requirements, including a new regulatory mandate to identify the beneficial owners of legal entities which are customers.Pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are required to:
Ł provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,

Ł inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to 
nonaffiliated third parties, and
Ł give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to nonaffiliated third parties.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and reporting requirements on 
us. In addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify financial statements in wri
ting, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters, the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures 

relating to corporate insiders and insider transactions, code of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financ
ial reporting.The Federal Reserve, jointly with the OCC and FDIC, has issued guidance to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial institutions take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. In addition, the federal financial regulators issued a proposed rule in April 2011 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act  to adopt standards for 

determining whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement may encourage inappropriate risk-taking that are consistent 
with the key principles established for incentive compensation in the guidance. The proposed rule would apply to financial 

institutions with $1 billion or more in assets, with heightened standards for financial institutions with $50 billion or more in assets. The guidance from the regulators on compensation is still evolving.  Available Information

19Item 1A: Risk FactorsRisk GovernanceWe use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggrega
te moderate-to-low. This does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities. Rather, the definition is intended to repr
esent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managed.Three board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile: Ł The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and 
practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal 
control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal 

audit division and the independent registered public accounting firm™s qualifications and independence; compliance with 

our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; and compliance with corporate 

securities trading policies.Ł The Risk Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks, the approval 
and monitoring of the Company™s capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderate-to-low risk 

profile, the risk governance structure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and determining adherence to 
the board™s stated risk appetite. The committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent 

risks: market, credit, liquidity, legal, compliance/regulatory, operational, strategic, and reputational. This committee also 

oversees our capital management and planning process, ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in 
relation to expected and unexpected risks, and that our capital levels exceed ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ requirements. Ł The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all 
technology, cyber security, and third-party risk management strategies and plans. The committee is charged with 

evaluating Huntington™s capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, 

including projected growth, technology capacity, planning, operational execution, product development, and 

management capacity. The committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive 

efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, security, and redundancy. The Committee oversees the allocation 

of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors. The Technology Committee monitors 

and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the Company™s strategic plans, including monitoring of 

overall industry trends. The Technology Committee reviews and provides oversight of the company™s continuity and 

disaster recovery planning and preparedness.The Audit and Risk Oversight Committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and 
risk management. On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both, such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to each committe
e and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors.Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risk-sensitive and
 aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce 

appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior
 management, a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the Company, a portion of net shares received upon exercise of 
stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients), equity deferrals
, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time.Management has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Appetite Framework. Critically important is our self-
assessment process, in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The
 segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, liquidi
ty, 
operational, legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In 
general, a range for each metric is established, which allows the Company, in aggregate, to operate within an aggregate moderat
e-to-low risk profile. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance, which may then 
necessitate corrective action.We also have four executive level committees to manage risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and Capital 
Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies.
20Huntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment
 risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testin
g, and oversee the self-assessment process. Corporate Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The 
Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk. Int
ernal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended.Risk OverviewWe, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or resul
ts of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing 
returns. Among the risks assumed are: Ł Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; Ł Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuati
on changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); Ł Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the Bank™s ability to liquidate 
assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; Ł Operational and legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud, inadequate or 
inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products
, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, a
nd process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; and Ł Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry.
We also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business processes and strategies and 
work relentlessly to protect the Company™s reputation. 
Strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor them through processes such as new product / initiative reviews, frequent 

financial performance reviews, colleague and client surveys, monitoring market intelligence, periodic discussions between 
management and our board, and other such efforts.
In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.
Credit Risks:1. Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially 
adversely affect our net income and capital.
Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $670 million at December 31, 2015, represented 
Management™s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and 

letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends,
 collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There
 is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes 
in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of 
our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if 
the ACL is 
not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
212. Weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business.
Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which 
have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in
 one or more of the following:Ł A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;

Ł A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and

Ł An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy 
laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision 
for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and 

manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these secto
rs.Market Risks:1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value
 of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, 

results of operations, and capital.
Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on inter
est earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors bey
ond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabiliti
es in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. The continuation of the current low interest rate environment or a deflationary environment with negative interest rates could affect 
consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may
 restrict our ability to increase net interest income.Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortg
age and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the prin
cipal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material 

adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued b
ut unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of fundin
g NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A 
decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  
Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized
 loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders™ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from thes
e portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to ﬁMarket Riskﬂ of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, w
hen rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. 
Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities
 will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.The value of our MSR asset is also a function of changes in interest rates and prepayment expectations.  Declining interest rates primarily in the longer end of the yield curve reduces the value of the MSR asset. In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions.  222. Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.
Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect
 competition to intensify due in part to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing low-growth economic environment. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans a
nd deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services
. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be 
adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments wit
h higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily o
n borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our ne
t interest margin.  For more information, refer to ﬁCompetitionﬂ section of Item 1: Business.
Liquidity Risks:1. Changes in either Huntington™s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor 
confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend 
credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies 
and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity.
Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued 
availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in 
particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the Liquid
ity Coverage Ratio, etc.), and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we m
ake significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or 
other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.2. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, an
d borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.
Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides member
s access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, market
able securities that is available as a source of liquidity.
Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the Bank and Corporation. The inability to access capital mark
ets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outst
anding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.Operational and Legal Risks:1. We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues an
d customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidentia
l information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.
Our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such a
s denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, 
or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of servi
ce attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including us. None of these events agains
t us resulted in a breach of our client data or account information; however, the performance of our website, www.huntington.com, wa
s adversely affected, and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website. We expect to be subject to simil
ar attacks in the future. While events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive 
and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evo
lving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.23Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, 
nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in 
penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not
 be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service 
providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the 
future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-base
d products and applications.Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and 
"spear phishing" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer
 will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including 
significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
 financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
2. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations for a particular period.
We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and 
regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It i
s possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of certain material litigation including litigation related to the bankruptcy of Cyberco Holdings, Inc. 3. We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by ou
r customers, regulators, and capital markets.
We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorize
d transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues
 and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could g
ive rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive l
itigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients,
 products and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain c
ustomers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or
 achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions (including our pending acquisition of FirstMerit 

Corporation).  Acquisitions may be subject to, and our pending acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation is subject to, the receipt
 of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of 
Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals
 for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, fu
ture business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders™ 
ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may also involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefo
re, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. 244. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accuratel
y and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our 

business and our stock price.
Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As 
a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such contro
ls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external 
events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our abi
lity to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.5. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.
Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are 
unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results
 of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy 
process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may 

not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately 

reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model™s design.
All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our mode
ls may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead 
us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an 
ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, 

information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their p
erception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.
6. We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  
We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced 
products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors an
d others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activ
ity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight 
related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, and control and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to active
ly manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-p
arty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.7. Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition
 and results of operations.
The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial 
accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that estab
lish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or position
s on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and re
port our financial condition and results of operations.  The FASB is currently close to issuing several new accounting standards tha
t will have significant impacts on the banking industry.  Most notably, new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using expec
ted losses (Current Expected Credit Losses) versus incurred losses is close to being finalized and, upon implementation, could 25significantly impact our required credit reserves.  Other impacts to capital levels, profit and loss, and various financial metrics will also result.Compliance Risks:1. Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the Basel III capital 
and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could 

impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or 

require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.
The Federal Reserve administers the annual CCAR, an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs. Under CCAR, the 
Federal Reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding company™s capital adequacy process. The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on 

supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, after making all capital actions included in a bank holding company™s capital plan, under baseline and stre
ssful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. Capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted by April 5, 2016, an
d the Federal Reserve will either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice of non-objection, no later than June 30, 2016. We intend to submit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2016. The Bank also must submi
t a capital plan to the OCC on or before April 5, 2016. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably t
o our capital plan, capital actions or stress test and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted final rules to implement the Basel III capital rules for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the
 Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank A
ct. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizat
ions. As a Standardized Approach institution, the Basel III minimum capital requirements became effective for us on January 1, 2015, 
and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, and a less stringent modifi
ed LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-da
y stress scenario. We are covered by the modified LCR requirement and therefore subject to the phase-in of the rule beginning Jan
uary 2016 at 90% and January 2017 at 100%. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly. The LCR assigns less severe outflo
w assumptions to certain types of customer deposits, which should increase the demand, and perhaps the cost, among banks for these deposits. Additionally, the HQLA requirements will increase the demand for direct US government and US government- guaranteed 

debt that, while high quality, generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolio
s.2. If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on ou
r financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions 

could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our 

services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, 
FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a w
ide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their supervisory pr
ocess, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of w
ays, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our abi
lity to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.
With the addition of the CFPB, our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny 
with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, 

enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from t
hese developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additio
nal compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.
263. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely 
affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business 

processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory 

capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our 

financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.
The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes
 the CFPB, and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. It is not possible to predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety, will
 impact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be 
significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately c
omply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financi
al results.4. We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the Federal Reserve and 
FDIC determine that our resolution plan is not credible. 
The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations jointly issued by Federal Reserve and the FDIC require bank holding 
companies with more than $50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that, in the event of material financial distress or failure, establish the rapid, orderly resolution of the Company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan is not ﬁcredible,ﬂ we could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy.  
5. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our financial holding 
company status.In order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and the Bank must remain ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ and ﬁwel
l managed.ﬂ If we or our Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for us to continue to qualify as a financial holding company, 
the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a financial holding company. If the failure to meet these standards p
ersists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.  In addition, our ability to commence or engage in certain activities as a financial holding company will be restricted if the Bank fails to maintain at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ rating on its most recent Community 
Reinvestment Act examination.

(2) The number shown represents, as of the end of each period, the maximum number of shares (approximate dollar value) of 
Common Stock that may yet be purchased under publicly announced stock repurchase authorizations.  On March 11, 2015, Huntington announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the proposed capital actions included in 
Huntington™s capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2015. These actions included a potential repurchase of up
 to $366 million of common stock from the second quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Purchases of common stock may 
include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated repurchase programs. Huntington™s board of 

directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with Huntington™s capital plan. This program replaced the previously
 authorized share repurchase program authorized by Huntington™s board of directors in 2014. 
29On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit 
Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction.  The transactio
n is expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regu
latory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation. As a result, Huntington no longer has 
the intent to repurchase shares under the current authorization.  30 Item 6: Selected Financial DataTable 1 - Selected Financial Data (1)(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)Year Ended December 31,20152014201320122011

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
2015 Financial Performance ReviewIn 2015, we reported net income of $693 million, or a 10% increase from the prior year.  Earnings per common share for the 
year were $0.81, up 13% from the prior year. This resulted in a 1.01% return on average assets and a 12.4% return on average ta
ngible common equity. In addition, we grew our base of consumer and business customers as we increased 2015 average earning assets by 

$5.3 billion, or 9%, over the prior year. Our strategic business investments and OCR sales approach continued to generate posit
ive results in 2015. (Also, see Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons within the Discussion of Results of Operations.)Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was $2.0 billion in 2015, an increase of $118 million, or 6%, compared with 2014. 
This reflected the impact of 9% earning asset growth, 7% interest-bearing liability growth, and an 8 basis point decrease in the NIM to 3.15%.  The earning asset growth reflected a $3.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average loans and leases and a $1.8 billion, or 1
5%, increase in average securities.  The increase in average loans and leases primarily reflected growth in C&I related to the acqu
isition of Huntington Technology Finance and automobile loans, as originations remained strong.  The increase in average securities primar
ily reflected the additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifying securities and the ongoing origination of direct purchase municipal instruments.  The increase in interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflected growth in money market deposits related to conti
nued 33banker focus across all segments on obtaining our customers' full deposit relationship, an increase in total debt related to the issuance of bank-level senior debt during 2015, and an increase in brokered deposits and negotiated CDs, which were used to efficiently 

finance balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.  This was partially offset by a decrease in 
average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to low and no cost demand deposits and money market deposits.  The NIM contraction reflected a 6 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and a 3
 basis point increase in funding costs, partially offset by the 1 basis point increase in the benefit to the margin from the impact of
 noninterest-bearing funds.  Overall asset quality remains strong, with modest volatility based on the absolute low level of problem credits.  The provision
 for credit losses was $100 million in 2015, an increase of $19 million, or 23%, compared with 2014.  NALs increased $71 million, or 24%, from the prior year to $372 million, or 0.74% of total loans and leases. The increase was centered in the Commercial portf
olio and was comprised of several large oil and gas exploration and production relationships.  NPAs increased $61 million, or 18%, f
rom the prior year to $399 million, or 0.79% of total loans and leases and net OREO.  NCOs decreased $37 million, or 30%, from the prior year to $88 million. NCOs represented an annualized 0.18% of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 0.27% in 
2014.  We continue to be pleased with the net charge-off performance across the entire portfolio, as we remain below our target
ed range.  Overall consumer credit metrics, led by the Home Equity portfolio, continue to show an improving trend, while the 
commercial portfolios continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loan
s.  ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.33% from 1.40% a year ago, while the ACL as a percentage of period
-end total NALs decreased to 180% from 222%. Management believes the level of the ACL is appropriate given the current composition o
f the overall loan and lease portfolio.  Noninterest income was $1.0 billion in 2015, an increase of $60 million, or 6%, compared with 2014. This reflected an increase 
in cards and payment processing income, mortgage banking income, and gain on sale of loans.  Cards and payment processing income increased due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth.  The increase in mortgage banking income was 

primarily driven by a $33 million, or 58%, increase in origination and secondary marketing revenue.  Gain on sale of loans increased due to an automobile loan securitization during 2015.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in securities gains 
and trust services.  In 2014, we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the LCR requirements, which resulted in securities gains.  The decrease in trust services primarily related to our fiduciary trust businesses moving to a more open architecture p
latform and a decline in assets under management in proprietary mutual funds. During the 2015 fourth quarter, Huntington sold HAA, HASI
, and Unified.  Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion in 2015, an increase of $94 million, or 5%, compared with 2014. This reflected an increase
 in personnel costs, other expense, and outside data processing and other services.  Personnel costs increased primarily due to an increase in salaries related to annual merit increases, the addition of Huntington Technology Finance, and a 3% increase in the
 number of average full-time equivalent employees, largely related to the build-out of the in-store strategy.  Other noninterest expens
e increased due to an increase in operating lease expense related to Huntington Technology Finance.  Outside data processing and other serv
ices increased, primarily reflecting higher debit and credit card processing costs and increased other technology investment expense, as we continue to invest in technology supporting our products, services, and our Continuous Improvement initiatives.  These increase
s were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles reflecting the full amortization of the core deposit intangible f
rom the Sky Financial acquisition.  The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at December 31, 2015, was 7.81%, down 36 basis points from a year ago.  On a Basel III basis, the regulatory CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.79% at December 31, 2015, and the regulatory tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.53%. On a Basel I basis, the tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.23% at December 31, 2014, and the regulatory tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.50%. All capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 23.0 million c
ommon shares over the last four quarters. During the 2015 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 2.5 million common shares at an ave
rage price of $11.59 per share under the $366 million repurchase authorization included in the 2015 CCAR capital plan.
Business OverviewGeneralOur general business objectives are: (1) grow net interest income and fee income, (2) deliver positive operating leverage, (3) increase primary relationships across all business segments, (4) continue to strengthen risk management, and (5) maintain capital and liquidity positions consistent with our risk appetite.  We are pleased with our 2015 performance. We delivered full-year revenue growth, disciplined expense control, strong net 
income, and EPS growth for our shareholders. Our consistent execution of disciplined lending and investment within a risk-balanced environment continues to pay off. We also took proactive steps to better position the Company moving into 2016 by investing in 
key growth drivers, such as technology and our in-store strategy, while exiting some non-core businesses.  Furthermore, the finaliz
ation of our in-store branch expansion is also visibly supporting our deposit and loan growth.  34EconomyOur small and medium sized commercial customers continue to express confidence in their businesses, while consumers continue to benefit from recovering real estate markets, low energy prices, and early signs of wage inflation in certain market
s.  The 
auto industry is an important component of the economy in our footprint, and it appears poised for another good year in 2016.  Other industries that contribute meaningfully to the regional economy, such as health care, medical devices and medical technology, a
nd higher education, among others, also remain positive.  Conversely, the low energy prices have negatively impacted certain secto
rs of the energy industry, including oil exploration and production firms.  
The state leading economic indices, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for our six state footprint, are all projected to be positive over the next six months, including West Virginia, which had been hard hit of late from the impact of 
declining coal prices.  Unemployment rates in our footprint states continue to trend positively and most remain in line with or better than the national average.  There is also a positive trend for our ten largest deposit markets, which collectively account for more than 80% of o
ur total deposit franchise.  Almost all of these markets continue to trend favorably, and seven of the ten markets currently have unempl
oyment rates below the national average. Legislative and RegulatoryA comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in the Regulatory Matters section 
included in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.2016 ExpectationsWe are well positioned starting the new year.  We continue to budget for unchanged interest rates through 2016. We will 
continue to execute our core strategies to deepen and grow customer relationships while carefully managing expenses to stay on 
course for 2016 performance.  Excluding Significant Items and net MSR activity, we expect full-year revenue growth will be consistent with our long-term 
financial goal of 4-6%. While continuing to proactively invest in the franchise, we will manage the expense base to reflect the
 revenue environment.  Overall, asset quality metrics are expected to remain near current levels, although moderate quarterly volatility also is expected, given the quickly evolving macroeconomic conditions, commodities, and currency market volatility.  Although we expect a gradual
 return to normalized credit costs, we anticipate NCOs will remain below our long-term normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points.  The effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%.  
Pending Acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation
On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit 
Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction expected to be v
alued at approximately $3.4 billion based on the closing stock price on the day preceding the announcement.  FirstMerit Corporation is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, which reported assets of approximately $25.5 billion based
 on their December 31, 2015 unaudited balance sheet, and 366 banking offices and 400 ATM locations in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, 

Illinois, and Pennsylvania.  First Merit Corporation provides a complete range of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its core operations.  Principal affiliates include: FirstMerit Bank, N.A. and First Merit Mortgage Corpo
ration.  Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of FirstMerit Corporation will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock and $5.00 in cash for each share of FirstMerit Corporation common stock.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the 20
16 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of 
the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation.  35Table 2 - Selected Annual Income Statements(1)(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31,  Change from 2014 Change from 2013

36DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective. It also includes a ﬁSignificant Itemsﬂ section (See Non-GAAP Financial Measures) that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of 

performance trends. Key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data are 

reported on a diluted basis. For additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the 
ﬁBusiness Segment Discussion.ﬂSignificant ItemsEarnings comparisons among the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were impacted by a number of Significant Items summarized below.
1. Litigation Reserve. $38 million and $21 million of net additions to litigation reserves were recorded as other noninterest expense in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This resulted in a negative impact of $0.03 and $0.02 per 

common share in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
2. Mergers and Acquisitions.
  Significant events relating to mergers and acquisitions, and the impacts of those events 
on our reported results, were as follows:Ł During 2015, $9 million of noninterest expense was recorded related to the acquisition of Macquarie Equipment 
Finance, which was rebranded Huntington Technology Finance.  Also during 2015, $4 million of noninterest 

expense and $3 million of noninterest income was recorded related to the sale of HAA, HASI, and Unified.  
This resulted in a negative impact of $0.01 per common share in 2015.  Ł During 2014, $16 million of net noninterest expense was recorded related to the acquisition of 24 Bank of 
America branches and Camco Financial. This resulted in a net negative impact of $0.01 per common share in 

2014.3. Franchise Repositioning Related Expense. Significant events relating to franchise repositioning, and the impacts of those events on our reported results, were as follows:Ł During 2015, $8 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded. This resulted in a negative 
impact of $0.01 per common share in 2015.Ł During 2014, $28 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded. This resulted in a negative 
impact of $0.02 per common share in 2014.Ł During 2013, $23 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded. This resulted in a negative 
impact of $0.02 per common share in 2013.4. Pension Curtailment Gain. During 2013, a $34 million pension curtailment gain was recorded in personnel costs. This resulted in a positive impact of $0.03 per common share in 2013.The following table reflects the earnings impact of the above-mentioned Significant Items for periods affected by this Results

Net Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet
Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets 
(primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest-

bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders™ equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often referred to as ﬁfreeﬂ funds,
 is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net
 interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest i
ncome has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate.The following table shows changes in fully-taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities: Table 4 - Change in Net Interest Income Due to Changes in Average Volume and Interest Rates (1) (dollar amounts in millions) 20152014

d liability categories. 2015 vs. 2014 Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2015 increased $118 million, or 6%, from 2014. This reflected the impact of 
9% earning asset growth, partially offset by 7% interest-bearing liability growth and an 8 basis point decrease in the NIM to 

3.15%.Average earning assets increased $5.3 billion, or 9%, from the prior year, driven by:
Ł $1.8 billion, or 15%, increase in average securities, primarily reflecting additional investment in LCR Level 1 
qualifying securities.  The 2015 average balance also included $1.7 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments 

originated by our Commercial segment, up from $1.0 billion in the year-ago period.
Ł $1.4 billion, or 8%, increase in average C&I loans and leases, primarily reflecting the $0.9 billion increase in asset 
finance, including the $0.8 billion of equipment finance leases acquired in the Huntington Technology Finance 

transaction at the end of the 2015 first quarter.
Ł $1.1 billion, or 14%, increase in average Automobile loans, as originations remained strong.

Ł $0.3 billion, or 6%, increase in average Residential mortgage loans.
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $2.4 billion, or 17%, while average total interest-bearing liabilities 
increased $3.1 billion, or 7%, primarily reflecting:Ł $1.5 billion, or 8%, increase in money market deposits, reflecting continued banker focus across all segments on 
obtaining our customers™ full deposit relationship.
Ł $0.7 billion, or 11%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits.  The increase reflected growth in both 
consumer and commercial accounts.Ł $0.7 billion, or 11%, increase in average total debt, reflecting a $2.1 billion, or 60%, increase in average long-term debt 
partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 51%, reduction in average short-term borrowings. The increase in average long-term 

debt reflected the issuance of $3.1 billion of bank-level senior debt during 2015, including $0.9 billion during the 2015 
fourth quarter, as well as $0.5 billion of debt assumed in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition at the end of 

the 2015 first quarter.
Ł $0.6 billion, or 29%, increase in brokered deposits and negotiated CDs, which were used to efficiently finance balance 
sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.Partially offset by:
Ł $0.7 billion, or 21%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding 
sources to low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposits.The primary items impacting the decrease in the NIM were:Ł 6 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, primarily reflecting lower rates on loans and the 
impact of an increase in total securities balances.  Ł 3 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield of total interest-bearing liabilities.
Partially offset by:
Ł 1 basis point increase in the benefit to the margin of noninterest-bearing funds.
412014 vs. 2013 Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2014 increased $133 million, or 8%, from 2013. This reflected the impact of 
12% earning asset growth, partially offset by 13% interest-bearing liability growth and a 13 basis point decrease in the NIM to
 3.23%.Average earning assets increased $6.1 billion, or 12%, from the prior year, driven by:
Ł $2.7 billion, or 29%, increase in average securities, reflecting an increase of LCR Level 1 qualified securities and direct 
purchase municipal instruments.Ł $2.0 billion, or 35%, increase in average Automobile loans, as originations remained strong.

Ł $1.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average C&I loans and leases, primarily reflecting growth in trade finance in support of 
our middle market and corporate customers.Ł $0.4 billion, or 8%, increase in average Residential mortgage loans as a result of the Camco Financial acquisition and a 
decrease in the rate of payoffs due to lower levels of refinancing.
Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 9%, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $4.7 
billion, or 13%, from 2013, primarily reflecting:Ł $3.2 billion, or 104%, increase in short-term borrowings and long-term debt, which are a cost effective method of 
funding incremental securities growth.Ł $2.2 billion, or 14%, increase in money market deposits, reflecting the strategic focus on customer growth and 
increased share-of-wallet among both consumer and commercial customers.Ł $0.5 billion, or 33%, increase in brokered deposits and negotiated CDs, which were used to efficiently finance balance 
sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.Partially offset by:
Ł $1.2 billion, or 27%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding 
sources to no-cost demand deposits and lower-cost money market deposits.
The primary items impacting the decrease in the NIM were:Ł 19 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, primarily reflecting lower rates on loans, and 
the impact of an increased total securities balance.Ł 3 basis point decrease in the benefit to the margin of noninterest bearing funds, reflecting lower interest rates on total 
interest bearing liabilities from the prior year.
Partially offset by:
Ł 9 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield of total interest-bearing liabilities, reflecting the strategic focus on
 changing the funding sources from higher rate time deposits to no-cost demand deposits and low-cost money market 
deposits.Provision for Credit Losses
(This section should be read in conjunction with the Credit Risk section.)
The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels appropriate to absorb 
our estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters-of-credit.The provision for credit losses in 2015 was $100 million, up $19 million, or 23%, from 2014, reflecting a $37 million, or 30%, decrease in NCOs. The provision for credit losses in 2015 was $12 million more than total NCOs.
The provision for credit losses in 2014 was $81 million, down $9 million, or 10%, from 2013, reflecting a $64 million, or 34%, decrease in NCOs. The provision for credit losses in 2014 was $44 million less than total NCOs.

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
2015 versus 2014The provision for income taxes was $221 million for 2015 compared with a provision for income taxes of $221 million in 2014. Both years included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, release of federal capital loss 
carryforward valuation allowance, general business credits, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. In 2015, 
a $69 million reduction in the provision for federal income taxes was recorded for the portion of federal deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized compared to a $27 million reduction in 2014. In 2015, there was essentially no change recorded in the provision for state income taxes, for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized, compared to a $7 million reduction, net of federal taxes, in 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $43 mil
lion. We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been
 completed for tax years through 2009. The IRS is currently examining our 2010 and 2011 consolidated federal income tax returns.
 Various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, 

West Virginia and Illinois.
2014 versus 2013The provision for income taxes was $221 million for 2014 compared with a provision for income taxes of $227 million in 2013. Both years included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, general business credits, and the 
change in accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. In 2014, a $27 million reduction in the 2014 

provision for federal income taxes was recorded for the portion of federal capital loss carryforward deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized compared to a $93 million increase in 2013. In 2014, a $7 million reduction in the 2014 
provision for state income taxes, net of federal taxes, was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized, compared to a $6 million reduction in 2013. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL
A comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the Risk Governance section 
included in Item 1A and the Regulatory Matters section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K.
Some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks 
are described in the following paragraphs.Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our AFS and HTM securities portfolios 
(see Note 4 and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset 
and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. While there is credit risk associated with derivative activ
ity, we 
believe this exposure is minimal.We continue to focus on the identification, monitoring, and managing of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit 
risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of modeling technology, and internal stress
 testing processes. Our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk 
profile. In our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origina
tion policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.  The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. All authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit 

administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers wi
th existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our 46primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. Although we offer a b
road set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes 
through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an 
aggregate moderate-to-low risk portfolio profile.The checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not extend additional cr
edit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position.Our asset quality indicators reflected overall stabilization of our credit quality performance in 2015 compared to 2014.
Loan and Lease Credit Exposure MixAt December 31, 2015, our loans and leases totaled $50.3 billion, representing a $2.7 billion, or 6%, increase compared to $47.7 billion at December 31, 2014. There was continued growth in the C&I portfolio, primarily as a result of an increase in equipmen
t leases of $0.8 billion related to the acquisition of Huntington Technology Finance. In addition, the automobile portfolio incre
ased by $0.8 billion as a result of strong originations. The CRE portfolio had modest growth over the period as the continued runoff of
 the non-core portfolio was more than offset by new production within the requirements associated with our internal concentration li
mits. Total commercial loans and leases were $25.8 billion at December 31, 2015, and represented 51% of our total loan and lease 
credit exposure. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type, customer size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of the following (see Commercial Credit discussion)
:C&I Œ C&I loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. The majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geograph
ic regions. C&I loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a C&I loan even though there is impr
oved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operation
s of the business to repay the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repaym
ent source for these types of loans. As we have expanded our C&I portfolio, we have developed a series of ﬁvertical specialtiesﬂ to ensure
 that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured, centralized Commercial Lending area with designated, experienced credit officers. These specialties are comprised of either targeted industries (for example, Healthcare, Food & Agribusiness, E
nergy, 
etc.) and/or lending disciplines (Equipment Finance, ABL, etc.), all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight
 to effectively mitigate and monitor risk. As such, we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertis
e to these specialty clients. CRE Œ CRE loans consist of loans to developers and REITs supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate 
properties. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the
 loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance properties such as apartmen
t buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the opera
tion, sale, or refinance of the property.
Construction CRE Œ Construction CRE loans are loans to developers, companies, or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Ou
r construction CRE portfolio primarily consists of retail, multi family, office, and warehouse project types. Generally, these lo
ans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. These loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real esta
te lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined 
construction schedule.Total consumer loans and leases were $24.5 billion at December 31, 2015, and represented 49% of our total loan and lease credit
 exposure. The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile loans, home equity loans and lines-of-credit, and residen
tial mortgages (see Consumer Credit discussion)
. The increase from December 31, 2014 primarily relates to growth in the automobile 
portfolio.Automobile Œ Automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in 
selected states outside of our primary banking markets. The exposure outside of our primary banking markets represents 22% of t
he total exposure, with no individual state representing more than 7%. Applications are underwritten using an automated underwriti
ng system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfolio.47Home equity Œ Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines-of-credit. This type of lending, which is secured 
by a first-lien or junior-lien on the borrower™s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refi
nance existing mortgage debt. Products include closed-end loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate, interest-only lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period. The
 home equity line of credit may convert to a 20-year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period. Applications are underw
ritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. The home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credi
t scores, debt-to-income ratios, and LTV ratios, with current collateral valuations. The underwriting for the floating rate lines
 of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for a rising interest rate.Residential mortgage Œ Residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15-year to 30-year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes. All residential mort
gage loan decisions utilize a full appraisal for collateral valuation. Huntington has not originated or acquired residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options.Other consumer Œ Other consumer loans primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate, including personal unsecured loans, overdraft balances, and credit cards.The table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio: Table 8 - Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition(dollar amounts in millions) At December 31,20152014201320122011

 (1) As defined by regulatory guidance, there were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of 
lending to a particular industry or group of industries.Our loan portfolio is diversified by consumer and commercial credit. At the corporate level, we manage the credit exposure in 
part via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be 
formally tracked and assigned limits as a percentage of capital. C&I lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE primary project types, loans secured by residential real estate, shared national credit exposure, and designated high risk loan definitions represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. Currently there are no identified 
concentrations that exceed the established limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the Risk Oversight Committee (ROC) and is one of the strategies used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overal
l objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Changes to existing concentration limits require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics.The table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by the type of collateral securing the loan or lease. Th
e changes in the collateral composition from December 31, 2014 are consistent with the portfolio growth metrics, with increases noted 48in the machinery/equipment and vehicle categories. The increase in machinery/equipment reflects the addition of approximately $
0.8 billion in equipment leases related to the acquisition of Huntington Technology Finance.
The increase in the unsecured exposure is centered in high quality commercial credit customers. Table 9 - Loan and Lease Portfolio by Collateral Type(dollar amounts in millions) At December 31,20152014201320122011

(1) 2015 includes a decrease of approximately $0.8 billion in automobile loans resulting from an automobile securitization 
transaction.(2) Reflects the addition of approximately $0.8 billion in equipment leases related to the acquisition of Huntington Technology
 Finance.Commercial CreditThe primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the 
borrower™s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, typ
e of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a 
number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. We utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval comm
ittee, led by our chief credit officer. The risk rating 
(see next paragraph) and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of $10.0 million. For loans not requiring senior loan committee 
approval, with the exception of small business loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in t
he industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority. 
For small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. In this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions to preserve our 
commitment to the communities in which we operate. In addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process.In commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant 
exposures on an on-going basis. All commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower™s P
D and LGD. This two-dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. The PD is rated and 

applied at the borrower level. The LGD is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and 
lien position associated with the underlying collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each p
eriodic monitoring event. There is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on-going basis. We continually review and 

adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses (ACL) amount for the commercial portfolio. A centralized portfolio 

management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans, to 
provide consistent oversight.In addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations. This group is part of our Risk 

Management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, and test the consistency of credit processes.49Our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. On an annual basis, or more frequently if warranted, we consider, among other thi
ngs, the guarantor™s reputation and creditworthiness, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth, assu
ming such information is available. Our assessment of the guarantor™s credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk rat
ings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our ACL methodology. When a loan goes to impaired status, viabl
e guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss.If our assessment of the guarantor™s credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the 
guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully.  
Substantially all loans categorized as Classified (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are managed by our Special Assets Division.  SAD is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of workouts,
 commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. Its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio.C&I PORTFOLIO
The C&I portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on-going operations of the business. Generally, the loans are secured by the borrower™s assets, such as equipment, accounts receivable, and/or inve
ntory. In 
many cases, the loans are secured by real estate, although the operation, sale, or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan. For loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements.We manage the risks inherent in the C&I portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with 
established limits, on-going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for the C&I portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as LTV a
nd debt service coverage ratios, as applicable.  Currently, a higher-risk segment of the C&I portfolio is loans to borrowers supporting
 oil and gas exploration and production and is further described below.  
The C&I portfolio continues to have solid origination activity as evidenced by its growth over the past 12 months and we maintain a focus on high quality originations. Problem loans had trended downward over the last several years, reflecting a 
combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the SAD. However, over the past ye
ar, 
C&I problem loans began to increase, primarily as a result of the oil and gas exploration and production customers and the increase in overall portfolio size.  We continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial dif
ficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the Credit Review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.We have a dedicated energy lending group that focuses on upstream companies (exploration and production or E&P firms) as 
well as midstream (pipeline transportation) companies.  This lending group is comprised of colleagues with many years of experi
ence in this area of specialized lending, through several economic cycles.  The exposure to the E&P companies is centered in broadly
 syndicated reserve-based loans and is 0.5% of our total loans.  All of these loans are secured and in a first-lien position.  T
he customer base consists of larger firms that generally have had access to the capital markets and/or are backed by private equity firms. 
 This 
lending group has no exposure to oil field services companies.  However, we have a few legacy oil field services customers for 
which the remaining aggregate credit exposure is negligible.The significant reduction in oil and gas prices over the past year has had a negative impact on the energy industry, particular
ly exploration and production companies as well as the oil field services providers.  The impact of low prices for an extended per
iod of time has had some level of adverse impact on most, if not all, borrowers in this segment.  Most of these borrowers have, therefore, had recent downward adjustments to their risk ratings, which has increased our loan loss reserve. We have other energy related exposures, including gas stations, wholesale distributors, mining, and utilities.  We continue to 
monitor these exposures closely. However, these exposures have different factors affecting their performance, and we have not s
een the same level of volatility in performance or risk rating migration.  CRE PORTFOLIO
We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to CRE lending, focusing on the quality of the developer and the specif
ics associated with each project. Generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at
 origination, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is non-owner occupied, require that at least 50% of the space of the project be preleased. We actively monitor both geog
raphic and project-type concentrations and performance metrics of all CRE loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based 50on the risk rating methodology. Both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecast market con
ditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the CRE portfolio.Dedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio. The portfolio is diversified by project type and loan s
ize, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the Credit Review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group compris
ed of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. We continue to perform on-goin
g portfolio level reviews within the CRE portfolio. These reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume
 associated with the projects being reviewed. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrow
ers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment.Consumer CreditConsumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type 
of exposure, and transaction structure. Consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions
 to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate. Each credit extension is assigned a specific PD and LGD. The P
D is generally based on the borrower™s most recent credit bureau score (FICO), which we update quarterly, providing an ongoing view 
of the borrowers PD.  The LGD is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension, which typically does not 
change over the course of the loan term.  This allows Huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management
 and ACL purposes.  
In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (i.e., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage 
performance analysis. All portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quali
ty indicators. We make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which ma
y result in changes to future origination strategies. The ongoing analysis and review process results in a determination of an ap
propriate ALLL amount for our consumer loan portfolio. The independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to 

ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.
Collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. The collection group 
employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency. In
 addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. Collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios.AUTOMOBILE PORTFOLIO
Our strategy in the automobile portfolio continues to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and profitability. Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to 

appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased origi
nation volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.We have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities. 
Importantly, we have maintained our high credit quality standards while expanding the portfolio.
RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE SECURED PORTFOLIOS
The properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. Huntington continues to support our local markets with consistent underwriting across all residential secured products. The residential-secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality, with the majority of the negative credit impact comi
ng from loans originated in 2006 and earlier. Our portfolio management strategies associated with our Home Savers group allow us to foc
us on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances.

Home Equity PortfolioOur home equity portfolio (loans and lines-of-credit) consists of both first-lien and junior-lien mortgage loans with underwrit
ing criteria based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and LTV ratios. We offer closed-end home equity loans which are
 generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate interest-only home equity lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period of the line-of-credit. Applications are underwritten centrally
 in conjunction with an automated underwriting system.Within the home equity portfolio, the standard product is a 10-year interest-only draw period with a 20-year fully amortizing 
term at the end of the draw period. After the 10-year draw period, the borrower must reapply, subject to full underwriting guid
elines, to continue with the interest-only revolving structure and maintain draw capability or begin repaying the debt in a term structure.Residential Mortgages PortfolioHuntington underwrites all applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. We do not originate residential 
mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options and have incorporated regulatory 
requirements and guidance into our underwriting process. Residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. We update values in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio 

management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions.Several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio, including various refinance programs such as HARP and HAMP, which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry. During the year ended December 31, 201
5, we closed $189 million in HARP residential mortgages and $3 million in HAMP residential mortgages. The HARP and HAMP 

residential mortgage loans are part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others.We are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. An appropriate level
 of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio.Credit Quality(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality 
performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs and NAL
s, 52TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and product segmentat
ion in the analysis of our credit quality performance.Credit quality performance in 2015 reflected continued overall positive results. Net charge-offs were substantially lower as a 
result of several large recoveries. NPAs increased 18% to $399 million, compared to December 31, 2014.  NCOs decreased 30% 

compared to the prior year. The ACL to total loans ratio decreased by 7 basis points to 1.33%.
NPAs and NALs
NPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) OREO properties, and (3) other 
NPAs. Any loan in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of pri
ncipal or interest is in doubt. Also, when a borrower with discharged non-reaffirmed debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is identified and 
the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.C&I and CRE loans (except for purchased credit impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $204 million of CRE and C&I-related NALs at December 31, 2015, $135 
million, or 66%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. With the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accr
ue interest, first lien loans secured by residential mortgage collateral are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. Junior-lien 
home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. Automobile and other consumer loans are generally charged-off prior to the loan reaching 120-days pas
t due.When loans are placed on nonaccrual, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income 
and prior year amounts generally charged-off as a credit loss. When, in our judgment, the borrower™s ability to make required i
nterest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease could be returned to accrual status.The table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail for each of the last five years:

Ł $103 million, or 143%, increase in C&I NALs, primarily reflecting the addition of several large oil and gas exploration and 
production relationships in the 2015 fourth quarter.  The remaining increase is not related to any specific industry or 

structure.  Partially offset by:
Ł $20 million, or 40%, decline in CRE NALs, reflecting improved delinquency trends and successful workout strategies 
implemented by our commercial loan workout group.Ł $12 million, or 16%, decline in home equity NALs, reflecting improved delinquency trends and moving $8.9 million of 
nonaccrual home equity TDRs from loans to loans held for sale.

TDR Loans54TDRs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs can be 
classified as either accruing or nonaccruing loans. Nonaccrual TDRs are included in NALs whereas accruing TDRs are excluded fro
m NALs, as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected. TDRs pr
imarily reflect our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty or to comply with regulatory reg
ulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filing situations.  Over the past five quarters, the accruing component of the total TDR balance has been between 86% and 83% indicating there is no identified credit loss and the borrowers continue to make their monthly payments.  In fact, over 81% of the $464 million of accruing TDRs secured by residential real estate (Residential mortgage and 
Home Equity in Table 14) are current on their required payments.  In addition over 60% of the accruing pool have had no delinquency 
at all in the past 12 months.  There is very limited migration from the accruing to non-accruing components, and virtually all of the 
charge-
offs as presented in Table 14 come from the non-accruing TDR balances.
The following table presents our accruing and nonaccruing TDRs at period-end for each of the past five years:

(1) Excludes approximately $88 million in accruing home equity TDRs transferred from loans to loans held for sale at September 
30, 2015.(2) Excludes approximately $9 million in nonaccruing home equity TDRs transferred from loans to loans held for sale at Septembe
r 30, 2015.Our strategy is to structure TDRs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial TDR terms. However, there 
are times when subsequent modifications are required, such as when the modified loan matures. Often the loans are performing in accordance with the TDR terms, and a new note is originated with similar modified terms. These loans are subjected to the norma
l underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions, both new and existing. If the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing TDR terms, typically an individualized approach to repayment is established. In accordance with AS
C 310-20-35, the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan. A 
new loan is considered for removal of the TDR designation. A continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the TDR designa
tion, and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument, it is included in our TDR activity table (below) 
as a new TDR and a restructured TDR removal during the period.
The types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new TDRs and include interest rate reductions, 
amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports, and principal forgiveness based on the borrower™s sp
ecific 55needs at a point in time. Our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified. A loan may be modified multiple
 times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and Huntington.Commercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing TDRs upon the granting of a new concession. If the loan is in 
accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms, the modified TDR remains in accruing status. For loans tha
t are on nonaccrual status before the modification, collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt, and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for at least a six-month period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruin
g status. This 
six-month period could extend before or after the restructure date.Any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower, requires the designat
ion as a TDR. There are no provisions for the removal of the TDR designation based on payment activity for consumer loans.  A loan 
may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed, with the risk of loss diminished.  During the 2015 third quarter, Huntington t
ransferred $96.8 million of home equity TDRs from loans to loans held for sale in anticipation of a sale.

ACLOur total credit reserve is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb 
credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combined, these reserves comprise the total ACL.
 Our ACL methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as 

well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio a
t the reported date. Additions to the ALLL result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting
 from loan risk-rating downgrades, while reductions reflect charge-offs (net of recoveries), decreased risk levels resulting from loa
n risk-rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. The AULC is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process t
o the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation.During the 2015 first quarter, we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and enhanced certain processes 
and methods of ACL estimation. During this review, we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for consumer 

receivables collectively evaluated for impairment and, as a result, extended our loss emergence periods for products within the
se portfolios. As part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process, we also evaluated the methods used to separately estim
ate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques. Rather, we now
 incorporate economic risks in our loss estimates as a component of our reserve calculation. The enhancements made to our credit
 reserve processes during the 2015 first quarter allow for increased segmentation and analysis of the estimated incurred losses within our loan portfolios. The net ACL impact of these enhancements was immaterial.
56During the 2015 third quarter, we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and completed a periodic 
reassessment of certain ACL assumptions.  Specifically, we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for commerci
al receivables collectively evaluated for impairment.  Based on our observed portfolio experience, we extended our loss emergence 

periods for the C&I portfolio and CRE portfolios.  We also updated loss factors in our consumer home equity and residential mor
tgage portfolios based on more recently observed portfolio experience.  The net ACL impact of these enhancements was immaterial.
We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the ACL by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, 
including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific 
borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to mee
t their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each repor
ting date. In addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, additional factors considered include: the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values, the diversification of CRE loans; the development of new or expanded Commercial business verticals such as healthcare, ABL, and energy. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the ACL 
to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.Our ACL evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL 
benchmarks to current performance. While the total ACL balance has declined in recent years, all of the relevant benchmarks rem
ain strong.The following table reflects activity in the ALLL and AULC for each of the last five years:

The $4 million, or 1%, increase in the ACL compared with December 31, 2014, was driven by:
Ł $16 million, or 48%, increase in the ALLL of the automobile portfolio. The increase was driven by growth in loan 
balances, along with the extension of loss emergence periods embedded within the portfolio™s reserve factors. It was 

partially offset by the impact of no longer utilizing separate qualitative methods to estimate economic risks inherent in our 

portfolio.Ł $12 million, or 4%, increase in the ALLL of the C&I portfolio. The increase in the allowance for credit losses within the 
commercial portfolio reflects the impact of select downgrades, including within the Oil & Gas portfolio. In addition, the 
extension of the loss emergence periods utilized in establishing the portfolio™s reserve factors contributed to the increase in
 reserve levels. Offsetting these increases was the decision to no longer utilize separate qualitative methods to estimate 

economic risks inherent in our portfolio, as well as improved performance on the Pass Graded portfolio over the past year.
Ł $11 million, or 19%, increase in the AULC driven by both Commercial and Consumer portfolio growth and by risk rating 
migration within the C&I portfolio which impacted the updated assessment of the unfunded commercial exposure.Partially offset by:
Ł $14 million, or 37%, decline in the ALLL of the other consumer portfolio. The decline was primarily driven by our 
assessment of consumer overdraft reserve factors, and the impact of no longer utilizing separate qualitative methods to 
estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios.Ł $13 million, or 13%, decline in the ALLL of the home equity portfolio. Continued improvement in the residential real 
estate market led to improved expected loss factors in the portfolio, along with no longer utilizing separate qualitative 
methods to estimate economic risks inherent in the portfolio. These reductions were partially offset by the extension of loss 

emergence periods utilized in the reserve factors for the portfolio.
Ł $6 million, or 12%, decline in the ALLL of the residential mortgage portfolio.  Continued improvement in both the 
residential real estate market and portfolio delinquency performance led to improved expected loss factors in the portfolio, 
along with no longer utilizing separate qualitative methods to estimate economic risks inherent in the portfolio lead to the 
reduction in reserve levels. These reductions were partially offset by the extension of loss emergence periods utilized in the 

reserve factors for the portfolio.59Ł $3 million, or 3%, decline in the ALLL of the CRE portfolio. The decline was driven by improving credit quality 
particularly reductions in CRE NALs as well as management™s decision to no longer utilize separate qualitative methods to 

estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolio and was partially offset by increases from the extension of loss emergence 

periods utilized in the reserve factors.The ACL to total loans declined to 1.33% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2014. Management 
believes the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the risk profile of our loan portfolio. Further, the continued focus on 
early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and proactive action plans for these loans, originating high quality new loans, and SAD resolutions is expected to contribute to maintaining our key credit quality metrics.Given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors, we believe that our ACL is appropriate and its coverage 
level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment.NCOsAny loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. Los
s confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an
 asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency where that asset is the sole source of repayment. Additionally, discharged, collat
eral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less a
nticipated selling costs at the time of discharge.
C&I and CRE loans are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value at 90-days past due with the exception of 
administrative small ticket lease delinquencies. Automobile loans and other consumer loans are generally charged-off at 120-day
s past due. First-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipat
ed selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. Residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair va
lue of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due.The following table reflects NCO detail for each of the last five years: 60Table 17 - Net Loan and Lease Charge-offs(dollar amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31,20152014201320122011

In assessing NCO trends, it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. The ALLL established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting. As a part of our nor
mal portfolio management process for commercial loans, the loan is periodically reviewed and the ALLL is increased or decreased bas
ed on the updated risk rating. In certain cases, the standard ALLL is determined to not be appropriate, and a specific reserve is 
established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan. Charge-offs, if necessary, are generally recognized 
in a period after the specific ALLL was established. If the previously established ALLL exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve th
e problem loan, a reduction in the overall level of the ALLL could be recognized. Consumer loans are treated in much the same man
ner as commercial loans, with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan, although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans. In summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence would be periods of re
serve building, followed by periods of higher NCOs as the previously established ALLL is utilized. Additionally, an increase in the A
LLL 
either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in NALs. When a loan is classified as NAL, it is evaluated for specific ALL
L or 
charge-off. As a result, an increase in NALs does not necessarily result in an increase in the ALLL or an expectation of higher
 future NCOs.All residential mortgage loans greater than 150-days past due are charged-down to the estimated value of the collateral, less 
anticipated selling costs. The remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goe
s through the foreclosure process. For the home equity portfolio, all of the defaults represent full charge-offs, as there is no remainin
g equity, 
creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher NCO impact.2015 versus 2014 61NCOs decreased $37 million, or 30%, in 2015, primarily as a result of continued credit quality improvement in the CRE, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios.  Given the low level of C&I and CRE NCO™s, there will continue to be some volatilit
y on a period-to-period comparison basis.Market RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the 
normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We 
have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk.Interest Rate RiskOVERVIEW
Huntington actively manages interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings. The interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations under different market scenarios designed to
 alter the direction, magnitude, and speed of interest rate changes, as well as the slope of the yield curve. These scenarios are desi
gned to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from, among other things, faster or slower mortgage, and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and changes in funding mix.INCOME SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC VALUE ANALYSIS
Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the ALCO monthly and ROC at least quarterly. The information 
reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.Huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (NII at Risk) and Economic Value of 
Equity at Risk (EVE). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a one-year time horizon. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement. Table 18 - Net Interest Income at Risk Net Interest Income at Risk (%)Basis point change scenario-25+100+200
Board policy limitsŠ%-2.0%-4.0%December 31, 2015-0.3%0.7%0.3%
December 31, 2014-0.2%0.5%0.2%
The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next one-year period. Due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent.Huntington is within board of director policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. There is no policy limit for 
the -25 basis point scenario. The NII at Risk reported at December 31, 2015, shows that Huntington™s earnings are not particularly 

sensitive to these types of changes in interest rates over the next year. In the recent period, while the amount of fixed rate 
assets, primarily auto loans and securities, increased, NII at Risk was not meaningfully impacted. As of December 31, 2015, Huntington had $8.2 billion of notional value in receive fixed-generic asset conversion swaps used for asset and liability management purposes.  In January 2016, $1.9 billion of notional value of these swaps were terminated. T
he remaining $6.4 billion of notional value will mature as follows: $3.0 billion in 2016, $3.3 billion in 2017, and $0.1 billion in 2018.  62Table 19 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk Economic Value of Equity at Risk (%)Basis point change scenario-25+100+200

-1.5%The EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates. Due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent.Huntington is within board of director policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. There is no policy limit for 
the -25 basis point scenario. The EVE reported at December 31, 2015 shows that as interest rates increase (decrease) immediately, t
he economic value of equity position will decrease (increase). When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic
 value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall. When interest rates rise, f
ixed rate liabilities generally increase economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value gained. The opposite is true when
 interest rates fall. The EVE at risk reported as of December 31, 2015 for the +200 basis points scenario shows a more liability sensitiv
e position compared with December 31, 2014. The primary factors contributing to this change were the growth of longer duration 

HQLA in preparation for LCR compliance and an increase in Automobile loans, offset somewhat by the growth of both Consumer and 

Commercial deposit balances.MSRs(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)
At December 31, 2015, we had a total of $161 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $16.2 billion in mortgage loans. Of this $161 million, $18 million was recorded using the fair value method and $143 million was recorded using the amortization method.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when 
mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We have employed strategies to reduce the risk 
of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic 
hedges. We report MSR fair value adjustments net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of nonintere
st income. Changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income.MSRs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately, impairment. MSR assets are included in accrued income and other assets i
n the Consolidated Financial Statements.Price RiskPrice risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-deal
er subsidiary, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans. We have 

established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held.  Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. In addition, the mix and maturity structure of Huntington™s ba
lance sheet, the amount of on-hand cash and unencumbered securities, and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on Huntington™s ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments. We manage liquidity risk at both the Bank and the parent
 company.
63The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and 
future obligations, and can maintain sufficient levels of on-hand liquidity, under both normal business-as-usual and unanticipa
ted stressed circumstances. The ALCO was appointed by the ROC to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidi
ty risk policies and limits. Contingency funding plans are in place, which measure forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages. Liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity po
sitions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding plans.Available-for-sale and other securities portfolio

Investment securities portfolioThe expected weighted average maturities of our AFS and HTM portfolios are significantly shorter than their contractual

Bank Liquidity and Sources of FundingOur primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and commercial core deposits. At December 31, 2015, these core deposits 
funded 73% of total assets (102% of total loans). Other sources of liquidity include non-core deposits, FHLB advances, wholesale debt instruments, and securitizations.  Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances and were $16 million 
and $19 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

The Bank maintains borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window. The Bank does not 
consider borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. Information regardi
ng amounts pledged, for the ability to borrow if necessary, and the unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Reserve Bank and
 the FHLB, is outlined in the following table:67Table 26 - Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB Borrowing Capacity(dollar amounts in billions)At December 31,20152014

(For further information related to debt issuances please see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
At December 31, 2015, total wholesale funding was $10.9 billion, an increase from $10.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The 
increase from prior year-end primarily relates to an increase in long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advance
s and short-term borrowings.  Liquidity Coverage RatioAt December 31, 2015, we believe the Bank had sufficient liquidity to be in compliance with the LCR requirements and to meet 
its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.  Table 27 - Maturity Schedule of Commercial Loans(dollar amounts in millions)At December 31, 2015One Year

At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, and security repurchase agreements totaled $2.6 billion. There were no securities of a
 single issuer, which are not governmental that exceeded 10% of shareholders™ equity at December 31, 2015.
Parent Company LiquidityThe parent company™s funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating
 expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to me
et obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities.At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the parent company had $0.9 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, in cash and 
cash equivalents.On January 20, 2016, the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.07 per common share. The 
dividend is payable on April 1, 2016, to shareholders of record on March 18, 2016. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $
0.07 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $56 million per quarter. O
n January 20, 2016, the board of directors declared a quarterly Series A and Series B Preferred Stock dividend payable on April 1
5, 2016 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2016. Based on the current dividend, cash demands required for Series A Preferred Stock a
re estimated to be approximately $8 million per quarter. Cash demands required for Series B Preferred Stock are expected to be les
s than $1 million per quarter.
68During the fourth quarter, the Bank paid dividends of $154 million to the holding company. The Bank declared a dividend to the 
holding company of $174 million in the first quarter of 2016. To help meet any additional liquidity needs, we have an open-ende
d, automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the SEC, which permits the parent company to issue an unspecifi
ed amount of debt or equity securities.On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit
Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction valued at 

approximately $3.4 billion based on the closing stock price on the day preceding the announcement.  The transaction is

expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regu
latoryapprovals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation.  Considering this potential obligation, and expected quarterly dividend payments, we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations 
for the foreseeable future.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include 
commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans.COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT
Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer™s cr
edit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing 
market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to
 expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate ri
sk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. See Note 20 
for more information.INTEREST RATE SWAPS
Balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and long-term debt from fixed-rate obligations to floating rate. Cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans. See Note 18 for more information.STANDBY LETTERS-OF-CREDIT
Standby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These
 guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financin
g, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters-of-credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the parent company and the Bank are required to hold. Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. When it
 is probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, a loss is recognized in the provision for credit
 losses. See Note 20 for more information.COMMITMENTS TO SELL LOANS
Activity related to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. In addition, we have commitments to sell residential real estate loans. These contract
s mature in less than one year. See Note 20 for more information.
We believe that off-balance sheet arrangements are properly considered in our liquidity risk management process.

Operational RiskOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compl
iance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. We actively and continuously monitor cyber-
attacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate internal systems, processes and c
ontrols to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses.
Our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts t
o penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently 

managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategi
es, which include efforts to make Huntington less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analyt
ic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our board-level Technology Committee, as appropriate. As a complement to the overall cyber security risk management, we use a number of interna
l training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. 
Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework, and any such
 third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality.
To mitigate operational risks, we have a senior management Operational Risk Committee and a senior management Legal, 
Regulatory, and Compliance Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and 

maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a senior management Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is 
evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. The
se committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be 
escalated to our ROC, as appropriate.The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies; minimize operational, fraud, a
nd legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance.Compliance RiskFinancial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. In September 2014, for example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued its final rule formalizing its ﬁheightened expectationsﬂ supervis
ory regime for the largest federally chartered depository institutions, including Huntington, to improve risk management and ensure
 boards can challenge decisions made by management. These broad-based laws, rules and regulations include, but are not limited t
o, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, dece
ptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. Additionally
, the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various reso
urces to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws an
d 70regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the e
xtension of credit. We set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our 

performance.Capital(This section should be read in conjunction with the Regulatory Matters section included in Part 1, Item 1 and Note 21 of the N
otes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)Both regulatory capital and shareholders™ equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active 
program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company™s overall capital adequacy. We 

believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders™ equity are adequate.
Regulatory CapitalBeginning in the 2015 first quarter, we became subject to the Basel III capital requirements including the standardized approac
h for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. The following table presents risk-
weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including the common CET1 on a Basel III basis, which we use to measure capital adequacy.

(1) On January 1, 2015, we became subject to the Basel III capital requirements including the standardized approach for 
calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. Amounts presented prior to January 1, 

2015 are calculated using the Basel I capital requirements.At December 31, 2015, we maintained Basel III transitional capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the FRB. All capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 23 million common shares in 2015.
Shareholders™ Equity
We generate shareholders™ equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends and share repurchases. Other 
potential sources of shareholders™ equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital
 at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. Shareholders™ equity totaled $6.6 billion at Decem
ber 31, 2015, an increase of $0.3 billion when compared with December 31, 2014.DividendsWe consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. Our current capital 
ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities.  On January 20, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per common share, payable on April 1, 
2016.  Also, cash dividends of $0.07 per common share were declared on October 21, 2015.  Cash dividends of $0.06 per share wer
e declared on July 22, 2015, April 21, 2015 and January 22, 2015. Our 2015 capital plan to the FRB included the continuation of o
ur current common dividend through the 2016 first quarter.
On January 20, 2016, our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative 
Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of $21.25 per share. The dividend is payable on April 15, 2016.   Cash dividends of $21.2
5 per share were also declared on October 21, 2015, July 22, 2015, April 21, 2015 and January 22, 2015.
73On January 20, 2016, our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of $8.31 per share. The dividend is payable on April 15, 2016.  Also, cash dividends of $7
.55 per share, $7.47 per share, $7.44 per share and $7.38 per share were declared on October 21, 2015, July 22, 2015, April 21, 201
5 and January 22, 2015, respectively.
Share Repurchases
From time to time the board of directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we 
announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our shar
e repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the FRB™s resp
onse to our annual capital plan.On March 11, 2015, Huntington announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the proposed capital actions included in 
Huntington™s capital plan submitted to the FRB in January 2015. These actions included a 17% increase in the quarterly dividend
 per common share to $0.07, starting in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the potential repurchase of up to $366 million of common stock over the five-quarter period through the second quarter of 2016. During 2015, we repurchased 23 million shares, with a weighted average price of $10.93. Purchases of common stock may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and 
accelerated repurchase programs. We have approximately $166 million remaining under the current authorization.  
On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit 
Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction.  The transactio
n is expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regu
latory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation. As a result of the announcement, 

Huntington no longer has the intent to repurchase shares under the current authorization.  BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION
OverviewOur business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. During the 2014 first quarter, we reorganized our business segments to drive our ongoing growth and leverag
e the knowledge of our highly experienced team. We now have five major business segments: Retail and Business Banking, Commercial 

Banking, Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate (AFCRE), Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group 

(RBHPCG), and Home Lending. A Treasury / Other function includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabiliti
es, revenue, and expense.  Business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure an
d, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial instituti
ons.Revenue SharingRevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.Expense Allocation
The management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to produc
t origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated 
to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five busi
ness segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported 

Significant Items, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the five business segments.Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP)
74We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments. The intent of the 
FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets an
d liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury 
/ Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of f
unds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rat
es for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).Net Income by Business SegmentThe segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table: Table 32 - Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment(dollar amounts in thousands)Year ended December 31,201520142013

Treasury / Other
The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or 
allocated to one of the five business segments. Other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. The f
inancial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above, is also included.
Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business s
egments, such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, merger, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provis
ion for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lowe
r. As a 
result, Treasury / Other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax 
rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments.Optimal Customer Relationship (OCR)Our OCR strategy is focused on building and deepening relationships with our customers through superior interactions, product penetration, and quality of service. We will deliver high-quality customer and prospect interactions through a fully integrated
 sales culture which will include all partners necessary to deliver a total Huntington solution. The quality of our relationships will
 lead to our ability to be the primary bank for our customers, yielding quality, annuitized revenue and profitable share of customers overal
l financial services revenue. We believe our relationship oriented approach will drive a competitive advantage through our local 
market delivery channels.CONSUMER OCR PERFORMANCEFor consumer OCR performance there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of checking account households, (2) product penetration by number of services, and (3) the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segments.The growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households. The overall objective is to grow the number of households, along wi
th an increase in product penetration.We use the checking account as a measure since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product. We count 
additional services by type, not number of services. For example, a household that has one checking account and one mortgage, we count as having two services. A household with four checking accounts, we count as having one service. The household relationsh
ip 75utilizing 6+ services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal. The overall objective, therefore, is to decrease the percentag
e of 1-5 services per consumer checking account household, while increasing the percentage of those with 6+ or more services.The following table presents consumer checking account household OCR metrics: Table 33 - Consumer Checking Household OCR Cross-sell Report Year ended December 31 201520142013

Our emphasis on cross-sell, coupled with customers being attracted to the benefits offered through our ﬁFair Playﬂ banking 
philosophy with programs such as 24-Hour Grace® on overdrafts and Asterisk-Free Checking
TM, are having a positive effect. The 
percent of consumer households with 6 or more product services at the end of 2015 was 51.9%, up from 49.4% at the end of last year. 
For 2015, consumer checking account households grew 4%. Total consumer checking account household revenue in 2015 was $1.1 

billion, up $106 million, or 10%, from 2014.COMMERCIAL OCR PERFORMANCE
For commercial OCR performance, there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of checking account commercial relationships, (2) product penetration by number of services, and (3) the revenue generated. Commercial relationships include 
relationships from all business segments.  The growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts. The overall objective is to grow the number of relationships, along with an increase in produc
t service distribution.The commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship. We use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the 

opportunity to increase our cross-sell activity. Multiple sales of the same type of service are counted as one service, which i
s the same methodology described above for consumer.
The following table presents commercial relationship OCR metrics: Table 34 - Commercial Relationship OCR Cross-sell Report Year ended December 31, 201520142013

By focusing on targeted relationships we are able to achieve higher product service penetration among our commercial 
relationships, and leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet. The percent of commercial relationships w
ith 4 or more product services at the end of 2015 was 44.3%, up from 41.9% at the end of last year. Total commercial relationship revenu
e in 2015 was $890 million, up $39 million, or 5%, from 2014. Retail and Business BankingTable 35 - Key Performance Indicators for Retail and Business Banking(dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise noted)  Year ended December 31,Change from 2014

Average earning assets for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $5.0 billion, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by:
Ł $2.1 billion, or 17%, increase in average securities, primarily reflecting the additional investment in LCR Level 1 qualifyin
g securities. The 2015 fourth quarter average balance also included $2.0 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments 

originated by our Commercial segment, up from $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Ł $1.3 billion, or 7%, increase in average C&I loans and leases, primarily reflecting the $1.1 billion increase in asset financ
e, including the $0.8 billion of equipment finance leases acquired in the Huntington Technology Finance transaction in the 2015 

first quarter.

84Average total deposits for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $4.6 billion, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter, including a $3.9 
billion, or 8%, increase in average total core deposits. The growth in average total core deposits more than fully funded the y
ear-over-
year increase in average total loans and leases. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.3 billion, or 8%, from
 the year-
ago quarter. Year-over-year changes in average total deposits and average total debt included:
Ł $3.0 billion, or 14%, increase in average total demand deposits, including a $2.0 billion, or 13%, increase in average 
noninterest-bearing demand deposits and a $1.0 billion, or 16%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits. The 

increase in average total demand deposits was comprised of a $2.1 billion, or 16%, increase in average commercial demand 
deposits and a $0.8 billion, or 11%, increase in average consumer demand deposits.
Ł $1.4 billion, or 8%, increase in average money market deposits, reflecting continued banker focus across all segments on 
obtaining our customers™ full deposit relationship.
Ł $0.7 billion, or 11%, increase in average total debt, reflecting a $2.9 billion, or 72%, increase in average long-term debt 
partially offset by a $2.2 billion, or 80%, reduction in average short-term borrowings. The increase in average long-term debt 

reflected the issuance of $3.1 billion of bank-level senior debt during 2015, including $0.9 billion during the 2015 fourth 
quarter, as well as $0.5 billion of debt assumed in the Huntington Technology Finance acquisition at the end of the 2015 first 

quarter.
Ł $0.5 billion, or 20%, increase in average brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, which were used to efficiently finance 
balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.Partially offset by:
Ł $0.6 billion, or 21%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding 
sources to low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposits.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased to $36 million in the 2015 fourth quarter compared to $2 million in the 2014 fourth quarter.  The 2015 fourth quarter included approximately $10 million related to E&P firms.  In addition, the year ago quarter i
ncluded a higher than expected level of commercial recoveries and a decrease in CRE NALs.  Noninterest Income Table 43 - Noninterest Income - 2015 Fourth Quarter vs. 2014 Fourth Quarter(dollar amounts in thousands) Fourth QuarterChange

N.R. - Not relevant. Noninterest income for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $39 million, or 17%, from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year 
increase primarily reflected:Ł $17 million, or 124%, increase in mortgage banking income, reflecting an $11 million increase in origination and secondary 
marketing revenues and a $5 million increase from net MSR hedging-related activities.85Ł $10 million, or 34%, increase in cards and payment processing income, due to higher card related income and underlying 
customer growth.Ł $9 million, or 30%, increase in other income, including $6 million of operating lease income related to Huntington 
Technology Finance and the $3 million net gain on the sale of HAA, HASI, and Unified.
Ł $5 million, or 8%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts, reflecting the benefit of continued new customer 
acquisition including a 2% increase in commercial checking relationships and a 4% increase in consumer checking 
households.Ł $5 million, or 87%, increase in gain on sale of loans.  
Partially offset by:
Ł $4 million, or 12%, decrease in trust services, primarily related to our fiduciary trust businesses moving to a more open 
architecture platform and a decline in assets under management in proprietary mutual funds. During the 2015 fourth quarter, 

the Company closed the previously announced transactions to transition the Huntington Funds and to sell HAA, HASI, and 
Unified.Noninterest ExpenseTable 44 - Noninterest Expense - 2015 Fourth Quarter vs. 2014 Fourth Quarter(dollar amounts in thousands) Fourth QuarterChange

Reported noninterest expense for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $15 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter. Changes in 
reported noninterest expense primarily reflect:Ł $26 million, or 10%, increase in personnel costs, reflecting a $26 million increase in salaries related to annual merit incre
ases, the addition of Huntington Technology Finance, and a 5% increase in the number of average full-time equivalent employees, 

largely related to the build-out of the in-store strategy.
Ł $10 million, or 19%, increase in outside data processing and other services expense, primarily related to ongoing technology 
investments.Partially offset by:
Ł $9 million, or 18%, decrease in other expense, primarily reflecting the $12 million net increase to litigation reserves in th
e 2014 fourth quarter partially offset by $4 million of operating lease expense related to Huntington Technology Finance.
Ł $7 million, or 64%, decrease in amortization of intangibles reflecting the full amortization of the core deposit intangible f
rom the Sky Financial acquisition at the end of the 2015 second quarter.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes in the 2015 fourth quarter was $56 million and $57 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. The 
effective tax rates for the 2015 fourth quarter and 2014 fourth quarter were 23.8% and 25.9%, respectively. At December 31, 201
5, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $43 million.Credit QualityNCOsNCOs decreased $1 million, or 5%, to $22 million. NCOs represented an annualized 0.18% of average loans and leases in the current quarter compared to 0.20% in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's results were positively impacted by recovery activity 
in the C&I and CRE portfolios as a result of continued successful workout strategies. We continue to be pleased with the net charge-of
f performance across the entire portfolio, as we remain below our targeted range. Overall consumer credit metrics, led by the Hom
e Equity portfolio continue to show an improving trend, while the commercial portfolios continue to experience some quarter-to-qu
arter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans.NALsOverall asset quality remains strong, with modest volatility based on the absolute low level of problem credits.  NALs increased $71 million, or 24%, from the year-ago quarter to $372 million, or  0.74% of total loans and leases. The increase was primarily
 centered in the Commercial portfolio and was primarily comprised of several large energy-related relationships. NPAs increased 
$61 million, or 18%, from the year-ago quarter to $399 million, or 0.79% of total loans and leases and net OREO. 
ACL(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
87The period-end ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.33% from 1.40% a year ago, while the ACL as a 
percentage of period-end total NALs decreased to 180% from 222%. Management believes the level of the ACL is appropriate given 

the credit quality metrics and the current composition of the overall loan and lease portfolio.  88Table 45 - Selected Quarterly Income Statement Data (1)(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)Three months endedDecember 31,September 30,June 30,March 31,

 (1) Comparisons for presented periods are impacted by a number of factors. Refer to the Significant Items section for additiona
l discussion regarding these items.(2) For all quarterly periods presented above, the impact of the convertible preferred stock issued in April of 2008 was exclud
ed from the diluted share calculation because the result would have been higher than basic earnings per common share (anti-
dilutive) for the periods.(3) Deferred tax liability related to other intangible assets is calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.

(4) High and low stock prices are intra-day quotes obtained from Bloomberg.

(5) Net income applicable to common shares excluding expense for amortization of intangibles for the period divided by average 
tangible common shareholders™ equity. Average tangible common shareholders™ equity equals average total common 

shareholders™ equity less average intangible assets and goodwill. Expense for amortization of intangibles and average 

intangible assets are net of deferred tax liability, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.
(6) Noninterest expense less amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment divided by the sum of FTE net interest income 
and noninterest income excluding securities gains (losses).(7) Presented on a FTE basis assuming a 35% tax rate.

(8) Tangible common equity (total common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets) divided by tangible assets (total 
assets less goodwill and other intangible assets). Other intangible assets are net of deferred tax, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.(9) Tangible equity (total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets) divided by tangible assets (total assets less good
will and other intangible assets). Other intangible assets are net of deferred tax, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate.(10) On January 1, 2015, we became subject to the Basel III capital requirements and the standardized approach for calculating 
risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. (11) Ratios are calculated on the Basel I basis.
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
Forward-Looking StatementsThis report, including MD&A, contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar exp
ressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations. The forward-looking statemen
ts are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities 

Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsenin
g of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected, (2) changes in general economic, political, or industry 
conditions, uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board, 
volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets, (3) movements in interest rates, (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services, (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services 92implementing our ﬁFair Playﬂ banking philosophy, (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our 
assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements, (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure, (8) the final outcome of significant litigation or adverse legal developments in the proceedings, and (9) the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the OCC, Fed
eral Reserve, FDIC, and CFPB. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We 
assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements.Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be 
helpful in understanding Huntington™s results of operations or financial position.  Where non-GAAP financial measures are used,
 the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.
 Significant ItemsFrom time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized
 impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. We refer to such items as Significant Items. Most often, 
these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the Company; e.g., regulatory actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments / refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases, they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business; e.g., merger / restructuring charges,
 recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains / losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.We believe the disclosure of Significant Items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which
 of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how t
hat performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly. To th
is end, we adopted a practice of listing Significant Items in our external disclosure documents; e.g., earnings press releases, investor 
presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K.Significant Items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis
Interest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  Management believes net 
interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes.  The FTE basis 
also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.  The FTE basis assum
es a federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent.  We encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other f
inancial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Non-Regulatory Capital RatiosIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
Ł Tangible common equity to tangible assets,

Ł Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel I definitions, and

Ł Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using Basel I and Basel III definitions.
93These non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the 

Company™s capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regu
lators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financia
l services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (ﬁGAAPﬂ) or federal banking regulations. As
 a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company™s calculation methods may 
differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to 

investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial 

information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Risk FactorsMore information on risk is set forth under the heading Risk Factors included in Item 1A and incorporated by reference into thi
s MD&A. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion, as well as
 the Regulatory Matters section included in Item 1 and incorporated by reference into the MD&A.Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our 

Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we use in our Consolidated Financial Statements.An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. The most significant accounting policies 
and estimates and their related application are discussed below.
Allowance for Credit LossesOur ACL of $0.7 billion at December 31, 2015, represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease 
portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performin
g on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risk asso
ciated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collate
ral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in intere
st rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be 

appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditio
ns, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially de
teriorates, the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net inc
ome and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
and results of operations.Valuation of Financial Instruments

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets mea
sured at fair value include certain loans held for sale, loans held for investment, available-for-sale and trading securities, certain s
ecuritized automobile loans, MSRs, derivatives, and certain short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2015, approximately $9.1 billion of our
 assets and $0.1 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition to the above mentioned on-going fair value measurements, fair value is also used for recording business combinations and measuring other non-recurring financial assets and liabilities. At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value. As necessary,
 assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date.Where available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined, using either internally developed or independent third-party valuation models, based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data. These inputs include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, option volati
lities, or option adjusted spreads. Where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available, fair value is determined 
using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management™s expectation that market partici
pants 94would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. The determination of appropriate unobservable inputs require
s exercise of significant judgment. A significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based
 on quoted market prices or observable market/ independent inputs.The following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available.Municipal and asset-backed securitiesThe municipal securities portion that is classified as Level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity. The fair value is determined by utilizing third-party valuation services. The
 third-party service provider reviews credit worthiness, prevailing market rates, analysis of similar securities, and projected cash flows. The third-party service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis. Huntington evaluates the analysis provided for reasonableness.Our private label CMO and CDO preferred securities portfolios are measured at fair value using a valuation methodology involving use of significant unobservable inputs and are thus, classified as Level 3  in the fair value hierarchy. The private 
label CMO securities portfolio is subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of our CDO preferred securities portfolio is reviewed quarterly. These reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a ba
sis for impairment analysis.Alt-A mortgage-backed and private-label CMO securities are collateralized by first-lien residential mortgage loans. The 
securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third-party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions. The model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, defa
ult rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures, house price depreciation / appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures.CDO preferred securities are CDOs backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. The collateral generall
y consists of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance 
companies. A full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfo
lio. We 
engage a third-party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooled-trust-preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. The PD of each issuer and 
the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value. Management evaluates the PD assumptions provided by the third-party pricing specialist by comparing the current PD to the assumptions used the previous quarter, actual defaults and de
ferrals in the current period, and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers. Huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates. Relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with ASC 820.
Derivatives used for hedging purposesDerivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. Assessments are made at the
 inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. A statistica
l regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness.
If, based on the assessment, a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effect
ive hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective. As the statistical regression anal
ysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates; we consider this a critical accounting estimate.Loans held for saleHuntington has elected to apply the fair value option to certain residential mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale at origination.  The fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include prices of mortgage backed securities a
djusted for other variables such as, interest rates, expected credit defaults and market discount rates. The adjusted value reflects the pr
ice we expect to receive from the sale of such loans.Certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on  observable prices for similar products or dis
counted expected cash flows, which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, and market discount rates. 95Mortgage Servicing RightsRetained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold. Mortgage servicing rights (ﬁMSRsﬂ) are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently re-measured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method.  The election of the fair value or amortization method 
is made at the time each servicing asset is established.  All newly created MSRs since 2009 are recorded using the amortization method.
  Any 
increase or decrease in fair value of MSRs accounted for under the fair value method, as well as any amortization and/or impairment of MSRs recorded under the amortization method, is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur. MSRs are subject
 to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. Fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model.  We use an independent third-party valuation model, which 

incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows. These assumptions include prepayment speeds, payoffs, and changes in 

valuation inputs and assumptions. The reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by 
at least one independent external service broker valuation. Because the fair values of MSRs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates, the use of different assumptions can result in different estimated fair values of those MSRs.
Contingent LiabilitiesWe are a party to various claims, litigation, and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our
 current and/or former operations. We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory 

proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control.Income Taxes
The calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have two 
accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts, reported as a component of accrued income and other assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and liabilities are recognized 
under federal and state tax law.
In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non-income taxes. The effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabil
ities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of all t
ransactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In addition, we rel
y on various tax opinions, recent tax audits, and historical experience.From time-to-time, we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we obtain opinion
s of outside experts and  assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. However, changes to our estimates of accrued t
axes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such changes could affect the a
mount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and/or results of operations. (See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2015, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $43 million. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Al
l available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impa
irment should be recognized. Our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. If our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the am
ount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be impaired. Based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the net deferred ta
x assets at December 31, 2015, other than a valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryovers.Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments
96Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2015 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accou
nting standards materially affect financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicab
le section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Management of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is responsible for the financial information and representations contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of this report. The Consolidated Fina
ncial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In all material respects, they reflect the substance of transactions that should be included based on informed judgments, estimates, and currently available information. Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which includes the careful selection and 
training of qualified personnel, appropriate segregation of responsibilities, communication of written policies and procedures, and a broad program of internal audits. The costs of the controls are balanced against the expected benefits. During 2015, the audit 

committee of the board of directors met regularly with Management, Huntington™s internal auditors, and the independent register
ed public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to review the scope of the audits and to discuss the evaluation of internal
 accounting controls and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditor
s have free access to, and meet confidentially with, the audit committee to discuss appropriate matters. Also, Huntington maintains a 

disclosure review committee. This committee™s purpose is to design and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure th
at material information relating to the financial and operating condition of Huntington is properly reported to its chief executive officer, 
chief financial officer, internal auditors, and the audit committee of the board of directors in connection with the preparatio
n and filing of periodic reports and the certification of those reports by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer.  
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT™S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Huntington™s Management assessed the 

effectiveness of the Company™s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, 

Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 

Internal ControlŠIntegrated Framework (2013).
 Based on that assessment, Management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company™s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The Company™s internal control ov
er financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public 

accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the next page. Stephen D. Steinour Œ Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer

February 17, 2016 98Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders™ equity and cash flows for the year then ended present fairly, in all mat
erial respects, the financial position of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective int
ernal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is 
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its ass
essment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management™s Assessment 
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with t
he standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform t
he audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effec
tive internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
 based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W
e believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the relia
bility of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company™s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to t
he maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a mater
ial effect 
on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of cha
nges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Columbus, Ohio

109Huntington Bancshares Incorporated
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations Š
 Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through its 

subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank (the Bank), Huntington is engaged in providing full-s
ervice commercial, small business, consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing, equipment leasing, 
investment management, trust services, brokerage services, customized insurance programs, and other financial products and services. Huntington™s banking offices are located in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Select financia
l services and other activities are also conducted in various other states. International banking services are available through the headquarters office in Columbus, Ohio and a limited purpose office located in the Cayman Islands.
Basis of Presentation Š
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Huntington and its majority-owned 
subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with GAAP. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in 

consolidation. Companies in which Huntington holds more than a 50% voting equity interest, or a controlling financial interest, or are a VIE in which Huntington has the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity™s econo
mic performance and has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be sig
nificant to the VIE are consolidated. VIEs are legal entities with insubstantial equity, whose equity investors lack the ability to make
 decisions about the entity™s activities, or whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity if
 they occur. 
VIEs in which Huntington does not hold the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity™s 
economic performance or does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could 

potentially be significant to the VIE are not consolidated. For consolidated entities where Huntington holds less than a 100% i
nterest, Huntington recognizes non-controlling interest (included in shareholders™ equity) for the equity held by others and non-control
ling profit or loss (included in noninterest expense) for the portion of the entity™s earnings attributable to other™s interests. In
vestments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when Huntington has the ability to exert significant influence. Those investments in nonmarketable securities for which Huntington does not have the ability to exert significant in
fluence are generally accounted for using the cost method. Investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are included in Accrued income and other assets and Huntington™s proportional interest in the 
equity investments™ earnings are included in other noninterest income. Investment interests accounted for under the cost and equity me
thods are periodically evaluated for impairment.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
significantly affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Huntington utilizes processes that involve the 
use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses, income taxes deferred tax assets, and contingent liabilities, as well as fair value measurements of investment securities, derivatives, goodwill, pension assets and liabilities, short-term borrowings, mortgage servicing rights, and loans held for sale. As with any estimate
, actual results could differ from those estimates.  
For statement of cash flows purposes, cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of Cash and due from banks, which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve and Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year™s presentation.

Resale and Repurchase Agreements Š
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third-party is continually mo
nitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned to Huntington in accordance with the agreement.Securities Š Securities purchased with the intention of recognizing short-term profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. The unrealized gains or losses on trading account securiti
es are recorded in other noninterest income, except for gains and losses on trading account securities used to hedge the fair value of MSRs, which are included in mortgage banking income. Debt securities purchased in which Huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. All other 
debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and other securities. Unrealized gains or losses on available-f
or-sale and 
other securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders™ 
Equity. Credit-related declines in the value of debt securities that are considered other-than-temporary are recorded in nonint
erest income.Huntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of OTTI. Huntington assesses whether OTTI has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. Management 110
reviews the amount of unrealized loss, the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position, the credit rating history, 
market trends of similar security classes, time remaining to maturity, and the source of both interest and principal payments t
o identify securities which could potentially be impaired. OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if Huntington intends to sell the security; (2) if it is more likely than not Huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all contractually required principal and interest payments. For secu
rities that Huntington does not expect to sell, or it is not more likely than not to be required to sell, the OTTI is separated into credit and noncredit components. A discounted cash flow analysis, which includes evaluating the timing of the expected cash flows, is comp
leted for all debt securities subject to credit impairment. The measurement of the credit loss component is equal to the difference b
etween the debt security™s cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at the security™s effective y
ield. The credit-related OTTI, represented by the expected loss in principal, is recognized in noninterest income. The remaining differen
ce between the security™s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit-rel
ated and, therefore, are recognized in OCI. Huntington believes that it will fully collect the carrying value of securities on which noncredit-related OTTI has been recognized in OCI. Noncredit-related OTTI results from other factors, including increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security. For securities which Huntington does expect to sell, or if it is more likely than not Huntington wil
l be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, all OTTI is recognized in earnings. Presentation of OTTI is made in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a gross basis with a reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Securities transactions are recognized on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed). The carrying value pl
us any related accumulated OCI balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses. Interest and dividends on 
securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period t
o maturity, are included in interest income.
Nonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. These securities are accounted for at cost, evaluated for impairment, and included in available-for
-sale and other securities. Loans and Leases Š Loans and direct financing leases for which Huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, are classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as loans and leases. Except 
for loans for which the fair value option has been elected, loans and leases are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and net of unearned income. Direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income. Interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method based on unpaid principal balances. Huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases, as well as the direct costs of those activities. Huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual values. Huntington amortizes loan discounts, premiums, and net loan origination fees and costs on a level-yield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans, which would not include purchased credit impaired loans.Troubled debt restructurings are loans for which the original contractual terms have been modified to provide a concession to a
 borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concessions provided are not avai
lable to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. Modifications 

resulting in troubled debt restructurings may include changes to one or more terms of the loan, including but not limited to, a change in interest rate, an extension of the amortization period, a reduction in payment amount, and partial forgiveness or deferment 
of principal or accrued interest.Residual values on leased equipment are evaluated quarterly for impairment. Impairment of the residual values of direct financing leases determined to be other than temporary is recognized by writing the leases down to fair value with a charge to 
other noninterest expense. Residual value losses arise if the expected fair value at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value recorded at the lease origination, net of estimated amounts reimbursable by the lessee. Future declines in the expected residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected losses of the leased equipment.For leased equipment, the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Huntington uses industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates. Additional information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades, as well as insight into 
competing products are obtained through relationships with industry contacts and are factored into residual value estimates where applicable.Loans Held for Sale Š
 Loans in which Huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale (excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell, which are carried at fair value) are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value option is generally elected for mo
rtgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging of the loans. The fair value of such loans is estimated based on the inputs that include pr
ices of mortgage backed securities adjusted for other variables such as, interest rates, expected credit defaults and market discount rates. The adjusted value reflects the price we expect to receive from the sale of such loans.Nonmortgage loans held for sale are measured on an aggregate asset basis.111Allowance for Credit Losses Š
 Huntington maintains two reserves, both of which reflect management™s judgment regarding 
the appropriate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combin
ed, these reserves comprise the total ACL. The determination of the ACL requires significant estimates, including the timing and am
ounts of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases, consideration of current economic conditions, and historical loss 
experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases, all of which may be susceptible to change.The appropriateness of the ACL is based on management™s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio. 
These judgments consider on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic
 risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of 
any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. Further, management evaluates th
e impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. In addition to g
eneral economic conditions and the other factors described above, additional factors also considered include: the impact of increasing or decreasing residential real estate values; the diversification of CRE loans; the development of new or expanded Commercial business segments such as healthcare, ABL, leveraged lending, and energy, and the overall condition of the manufacturing industry. Also,
 the ACL assessment includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to curren
t performance. The ALLL consists of two components: (1) the transaction reserve, which includes a loan level allocation, specific reserves 
related to loans considered to be impaired, and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings, and (2) the general reserve. Th
e transaction reserve component includes both (1) an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and (2) an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of each impaired C&I and CRE loan where obligor balance is greater than $1.0 million. For the C&I and CRE portfolios, the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with similar characteristics is made by applying a PD factor and a LGD factor to each individual loan based on a regularly updated loan grade, using a standardized loan grading system. The PD factor and an LGD factor are determined for each loan grade using stati
stical models based on historical performance data. The PD factor considers on-going reviews of the financial performance of the speci
fic borrower, including cash flow, debt-service coverage ratio, earnings power, debt level, and equity position, in conjunction wit
h an assessment of the borrower™s industry and future prospects. The LGD factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the
 relative LTV ratio. These reserve factors are developed based on credit migration models that track historical movements of loans betwee
n loan ratings over time and a combination of long-term average loss experience of our own portfolio and external industry data.In the case of more homogeneous portfolios, such as automobile loans, home equity loans, and residential mortgage loans, the determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates PD and LGD factors. The estimate of loss is based on pools of loans 
and leases with similar characteristics. The PD factor considers current credit scores unless the account is delinquent, in which c
ase a higher PD factor is used. The credit score provides a basis for understanding the borrower™s past and current payment performan
ce, and this information is used to estimate expected losses over the emergence period. The performance of first-lien loans ahead o
f our junior-lien loans is available to use as part of our updated score process. The LGD factor considers analysis of the type of co
llateral and the relative LTV ratio. Credit scores, models, analyses, and other factors used to determine both the PD and LGD factors ar
e updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios, as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies, and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as required. The general reserve consists of various risk-profile reserve components.  The risk-profile component considers items unique to 
our structure, policies, processes, and portfolio composition, as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan 
portfolios including, but not limited to, management quality, concentrations, portfolio composition, industry comparisons, and 
internal review functions.The estimate for the AULC is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the ALLL. The loss factors 
used in the AULC are the same as the loss factors used in the ALLL while also considering a historical utilization of unused 

commitments. The AULC is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Š Loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date.Any loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When a borrower with debt is discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower, 
the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status, unless there is a co-borrower.
All classes within the C&I and CRE portfolios (except for purchased credit-impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due. First-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. Junior-lien home equity lo
ans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. Automobile and other consumer loans are generally charged-off when the loan is 120-days past due. Residential mortgage loans ar
e placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due, with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies 112
which continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency. We are reimbursed from the government agency
 for reasonable expenses incurred in servicing loans. For all classes within all loan portfolios, when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income, and prior year amounts charged-off as a credit loss.
For all classes within all loan portfolios, cash receipts received on NALs are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full, after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income. However, for secured n
on-reaffirmed debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a 

capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured. For unsecured non-reaffirmed debt in
 a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the carrying value has been fully charged-off, payments are recorded as loan recoveries.
Regarding all classes within the C&I and CRE portfolios, the determination of a borrower™s ability to make the required 
principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrower™s current financial statements, industry, management
 capabilities, and other qualitative measures. For all classes within the consumer loan portfolio, the determination of a borrower™s 
ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on multiple factors, including number of days past due and, in some instances, an evaluation of the borrower™s financial condition. When, in management™s judgment, the borrower™s ability to 
make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt, supported by sustained repayment history,  
the loan is returned to accrual status. For these loans that have been returned to accrual status, cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan.Charge-off of Uncollectible Loans Š Any loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a 
loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued 
delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source
 of repayment. Additionally, discharged, collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a 
charge-
off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs.
C&I and CRE loans are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value at 90-days past due. Automobile loans and 
other consumer loans are charged-off at 120-days past due. First-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the 

estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. 
Residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150-days past due.
Impaired Loans Š
 For all classes within the C&I and CRE portfolios, all loans with an obligor balance of $1.0 million or greater are evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment. Except for TDRs, consumer loans within any class are generally not 

individually evaluated on a regular basis for impairment. All TDRs, regardless of the outstanding balance amount, are also cons
idered to be impaired. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impaired.Once a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment, the loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. This determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates, and the eventual outcome may differ significa
ntly from those estimates.When a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, the observable mar
ket price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, if the loan is collateral dependent. When the pr
esent value of expected future cash flows is used, the effective interest rate is the original contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted 
for any cost, fee, premium, or discount. When the contractual interest rate is variable, the effective interest rate of the loan changes over
 time. A 
specific reserve is established as a component of the ALLL when a loan has been determined to be impaired. Subsequent to the in
itial measurement of impairment, if there is a significant change to the impaired loan™s expected future cash flows, or if actual cas
h flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously estimated, Huntington recalculates the impairment and appropriately 
adjusts the specific reserve. Similarly, if Huntington measures impairment based on the observable market price of an impaired loan or 
the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan, Huntington will adjust the specific reserve.When a loan within any class is impaired, the accrual of interest income is discontinued unless the receipt of principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Interest income on TDRs is accrued when all principal and interest is expected to be collected 
under the post-modification terms. Cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired loans within any class are generally applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full (including already charged-off portion), after which time any additional ca
sh receipts are recognized as interest income. Cash receipts received on accruing impaired loans within any class are applied in the same manner as accruing loans that are not considered impaired.113
Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans Š
 Purchased loans with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are considered to be credit impaired. Purchased credit-impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value, which is estimated by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date. Because the estimate of expected cash flows reflects an estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans, an allowance for credit losses is not recorded at the acquisition date. The
 excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value, referred to as the accretable yield, is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan, or pool of loans, on a level-yield basis. The difference between the contractually require
d payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. A sub
sequent decrease in the estimate of cash flows expected to be received on purchased credit-impaired loans generally results in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in reversal of any nonaccretable difference (or al
lowance for loan and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded) with a positive impact on interest income subsequently recognized. The measurement of cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for interest rates, prepayments, default rates, loss severity, and
 collateral values. All of these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the l
ife of the loan can result.Transfers of Financial Assets and Securitizations Š
 Transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over 
the transferred assets are accounted for as sales. In assessing whether control has been surrendered, we consider whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate, the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets, 
and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer, even if they were n
ot entered into at the time of transfer. Control is generally considered to have been surrendered when (i) the transferred assets 
have been legally isolated from us or any of our consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the transferee (
or, if the 
transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or asset-backed financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives, each third-party holder of its beneficial interests) has the right to pledge or exchange the assets (or beneficial interests) it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to us, and (iii) neither we nor our consolidated affiliates and agents have (a) both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the trans
ferred assets before their maturity, (b) the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also prov
ides us with a more-than-trivial benefit (other than through a cleanup call) or (c) an agreement that permits the transferee to require us to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require us to repurchase them.If the sale criteria are met, the transferred financial assets are removed from our balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If the sale criteria are not met, the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on our balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability. For the majority of financial asset transfers, it is
 clear whether or not we have surrendered control. For other transfers, such as in connection with complex transactions or where we have continuing involvement, we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by law.
We have historically securitized certain automobile receivables. Gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing 
rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or third-party. For loan or lease sales with servicing retained, a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to serv
ice the loans sold.Derivative Financial Instruments Š A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, caps, floors, 
and collars, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. These instruments provide flexibility in adjusting Huntington™s sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to lo
ss of principal and higher funding requirements.Huntington also uses derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its MSRs. These derivatives consist primarily 
of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts. The derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedge
s. Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, we designate it as either: Ł a qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value 
hedge);Ł a qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset liability or forecas
ted transaction (cash flow hedge); orŁ a trading instrument or a non-qualifying (economic) hedge.
114
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective as a hedge,
 are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is reflected in current period earnings. Changes 
in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes or which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earnings.For those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied, Huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hed
ged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and, unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness, the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how ineffectiveness wil
l be measured. The methods utilized to assess retrospective hedge effectiveness, as well as the frequency of testing, vary based on 
the type of item being hedged and the designated hedge period. For specifically designated fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate debt, Huntington utilizes the short-cut method when certain criteria are met. For other fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt, including certificates of deposit, Huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. For fa
ir value hedges of portfolio loans, the regression method is used to evaluate effectiveness on a daily basis. For cash flow hedges, the 
regression method is applied on a quarterly basis.Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when:Ł the derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a 
hedged item (including firm commitments or forecasted transactions);Ł the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised;

Ł it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur;

Ł the hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or

Ł the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removed.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair val
ue or cash flow hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value.In the case of a discontinued fair value hedge of a recognized asset or liability, as long as the hedged item continues to exis
t on the balance sheet, the hedged item will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value. The basis adjustment that had previous
ly been recorded to the hedged item during the period from the hedge designation date to the hedge discontinuation date is recognized as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item over the remaining life of the hedged item.In the case of a discontinued cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability, as long as the hedged item continues to exist
 on the balance sheet, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging derivative will no longer be recorded to o
ther comprehensive income. The balance applicable to the discontinued hedging relationship will be recognized in earnings over the 

remaining life of the hedged item as an adjustment to yield. If the discontinued hedged item was a forecasted transaction that is not expected to occur, any amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to the hedged item, including any amounts recorded in 

accumulated other comprehensive income, are immediately reclassified to current period earnings.In the case of either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge, if the previously hedged item is sold or extinguished, the basis adjustment to the underlying asset or liability or any remaining unamortized other comprehensive income balance will be reclassified to current period earnings.In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings unless re-designated as a qualifying hedge.Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element of credit risk, which is the possibility that Huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. Notional values of interest rate swaps and other off
-balance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based. Credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to Huntington, including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties. Potential credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions, collateral agreements, and other contract provisions. Huntington considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivatives.Huntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cas
h collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instrument(s) recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.115
Repossessed Collateral Š Repossessed collateral, also referred to as other real estate owned (OREO), is comprised principally of commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations, and is carried at fair value. Collateral obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the property™s appraised value at the date of foreclosure, with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carry
ing value of the loan recorded as a charge-off. If the fair value is higher than the carrying amount of the loan the excess is recognized
 first as a recovery and then as noninterest income. Subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in noninterest expense. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of collateral are recognized in noninterest expense at the date of sale.Collateral Š We pledge assets as collateral as required for various transactions including security repurchase agreements, 
public deposits, loan notes, derivative financial instruments, short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings. Assets that have
 been pledged as collateral, including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party, continue to be reported on our Conso
lidated Balance Sheets.We also accept collateral, primarily as part of various transactions including derivative and security resale agreements. Colla
teral accepted by us, including collateral that we can sell or repledge, is excluded from our Consolidated Balance Sheets.The market value of collateral we have accepted or pledged is regularly monitored and additional collateral is obtained or provided as necessary to ensure appropriate collateral coverage in these transactions. Premises and Equipment Š
 Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to 30 years, respectively. Land improvements and
 furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of 5 to 20 years, while equipment is depreciated over a range of 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset™s useful life or the lease term, including any renewal period
s for which renewal is reasonably assured. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend
 the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life. Premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.Mortgage Servicing Rights Š Huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets, which are included in Accrued income and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets when purchased, or when servicing is contractual
ly separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained.For loan sales with servicing retained, a servicing asset is recorded on the day of the sale at fair value for the right to service the loans sold. To determine the fair value of a MSR, Huntington uses an option adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating ma
rket implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and market interest rates. The forward rates utiliz
ed are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. The current and projected mortgage interest rate influences the prepayment rate and, therefore, the timing and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the MSR. Servicing revenues on mortgage loans are included in mortgage banking income.At the time of initial capitalization, MSRs may be grouped into servicing classes based on the availability of market inputs used in determining fair value and the method used for managing the risks of the servicing assets. MSR assets are recorded using the fair value method or the amortization method. The election of the fair value or amortization method is made at the time each servici
ng class is established. All newly created MSRs since 2009 were recorded using the amortization method. Any change in the fair val
ue of MSRs carried under the fair value method, as well as amortization and impairment of MSRs under the amortization method, during 
the period is recorded in mortgage banking income, which is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Huntington 
economically hedges the value of certain MSRs using derivative instruments and trading securities. Changes in fair value of these derivatives and trading securities are reported as a component of mortgage banking income.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Š
 Under the acquisition method of accounting, the net assets of entities acquired byHuntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess cost of the acquisition over the f
air value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets are amortized either on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at October 1st of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Š
 We recognize the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net postretirement benefit cost charged to current earnings related to these plans is based on var
ious actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experience.Certain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other non-qualified supplemental retirement plans. Our contributions to these plans are charged to current earnings.
116
In addition, we maintain a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions to the plan, which are charged to current earnings, are based on employee contributions.
Share-Based Compensation Š
 We use the fair value based method of accounting for awards of HBAN stock granted to 
employees under various stock option and restricted share plans. Stock compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans. Compensation expense relating to share options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service perio
d (e.g. vesting period). Compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period (e.g., vesting period) of the award.
Stock Repurchases Š
 Acquisitions of Huntington stock are recorded at cost. The re-issuance of shares is recorded at weighted-
average cost.Income Taxes Š
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial
 statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recove
red or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income at the time of enac
tment of such change in tax rates. Any interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income ta
xes. To 
the extent that we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is recorded. All positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly 
basis. In determining the requirements for a valuation allowance, sources of possible taxable income are evaluated including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 

carryforwards, taxable income in appropriate carryback years, and tax-planning strategies. Huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties.Bank Owned Life Insurance Š Huntington™s bank owned life insurance policies are recorded at their cash surrender value. 
Huntington recognizes tax-exempt income from the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these policies and from death benefits. A portion of the cash surrender value is supported by holdings in separate accounts. Book value protection for the se
parate accounts is provided by the insurance carriers and a highly rated major bank.Fair Value Measurements Š
 The Company records or discloses certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is 
defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
 instrument.Level 3 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.A financial instrument™s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is signific
ant to the fair value measurement.Segment Results Š Accounting policies for the business segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment. However, the 

preparation of business segment results requires management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits, 
expenses, and other financial elements to each business segment. 2. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE
ASU 2014-04ŠReceivables (Topic 310): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans 
upon Foreclosure.
 The ASU clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs upon either the creditor obtaining legal 
title to the residential real estate property or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The amendments were
 effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014. The
 amendments did not have a material impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2014-09ŠRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): 
The amendments in ASU 2014-09 supersede the revenue 
recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The general principle of the 

amendments require an entity to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that 117
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance set
s forth a five step approach to be utilized for revenue recognition. The amendments were originally effective for annual reporting period
s beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Subsequently, the FASB issued a one-
year deferral for implementation, which results in new guidance being effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning a
fter December 15, 2017. The FASB, however, permitted adoption of the new guidance on the original effective date. Management is 

currently assessing the impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2014-11ŠTransfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and 
Disclosures.
 The amendments in the ASU require repurchase-to-maturity transactions to be recorded and accounted for as secured 
borrowings. Amendments to Topic 860 also require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneo
usly with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty (i.e., a repurchase financing), which will result in secured borrowing 
accounting for the repurchase agreement, as well as additional required disclosures. The accounting amendments and disclosures 
are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The disclosures for repurchase agreements, securiti
es lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are required to be presented for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and for interim periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The amendments did no
t have a material impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2014-12ŠCompensationŠStock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of 
an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.
 The amendments require 
that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a 
performance condition. Specifically, if the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service p
eriod, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. Th
e amendments are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. 

Management is currently assessing the impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2014-14ŠReceivablesŠTroubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain 
Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
 The amendments require a mortgage loan to be derecognized and a 
separate receivable to be recognized upon foreclosure if the loan has a government guarantee that is non-separable from the loan before foreclosure, the creditor has the ability and intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor, and any amount
 of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed. Additionally, the separate other receivabl
e should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor upon 
foreclosure. The amendments were effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after 

December 15, 2014. The amendments did not have a material impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2015-02ŠConsolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
. The amendment applies to entities in all 
industries and provides a new scope exception for registered money market funds and similar unregistered money market funds. It also makes targeted amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from 

applying the variable interest entity accounting guidance. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after 

December 15, 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2015-03ŠImputation of Interest (Topic 835): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.
 This ASU was issued to 
simplify presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in this ASU require debt issuance costs related to a recognized de
bt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent w
ith debt discounts.  Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to amend the SEC paragraph related to debt issuance cost. The amendment 

applies to debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement which may be presented as an asset. The cost related to 
the line-of credit should be subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and measuremen
t guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments are effective for financial 

statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendm
ent is not expected to have a material impact on Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
ASU 2015-10ŠTechnical Corrections and Improvements.
 The technical corrections and improvements included in the ASU are 
issued in June 2015 with an objective to clarify the Accounting Standards Codification (ﬁCodificationﬂ), correct unintended 

application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the Codification that are minor in nature. One of the corrections is related to disclosure of fair value for non-recurring items. The ASU requires disclosure of fair value for non-recurring items at the rele
vant measurement date where the fair value is not measured at the end of the reporting period. Also, for nonrecurring measurements 

estimated at a date during the reporting period other than the end of the reporting period, a reporting entity shall clearly indicate that the fair value information presented is not as of the period™s end as well as the date or period that the measurement was taken
. The technical correction is effective upon issuance. The correction in the ASU does not have a significant impact on Huntington™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements.ASU 2015-16 Š Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. 
The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in 118
which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to record, in the same period™s financial statements, the
 effect 
on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisi
onal amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments require an entity to presen
t separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been 
recognized as of the acquisition date. The Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including in
terim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional 

amounts that occur after the effective date of this Update with earlier application permitted.  Management will continue to mon
itor the applicability of this amendment to Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
ASU 2016-01 Š Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. 
The amendments in this Update make targeted improvements to GAAP including, but not limited to, requiring an entity to measure its equity investments (i.e., 

investment that are not accounted for using equity method of accounting or are consolidated) with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement, requiring an entity to present separately in OCI the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments (i.e., FVO liability), requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, and eliminating some of the disclosures required by the existing GAAP while requiring entities to present and disclose some additional information. The new guidance is
 effective for the fiscal period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An enti
ty may, 
however, choose to adopt the requirement to present separately the credit mark on FVO liability earlier at the beginning of any
 fiscal year if the financial statements for the fiscal year or interim periods have not been issued. An entity should apply the amendm
ents by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendment 
is not expected to have a material impact on Huntington's Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. LOANS AND LEASES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Except for loans which are accounted for at fair value, loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized premiums and discounts and deferred loan fees and costs, which resulted in a net premium of $262 million and $230 million, at 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Huntington Technology Finance acquisition
On March 31, 2015, Huntington completed its acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which was re-branded Huntington Technology Finance. Lease receivables with a fair value of $839 million, including a lease residual value of approximately $200
 million, were acquired by Huntington. These leases were recorded at fair value. The fair values of the leases were estimated us
ing discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates currently being offered for leases with similar terms (Level 3), and reflect
ed an estimate of credit and other risk associated with the leases.Camco Financial acquisitionOn March 1, 2014, Huntington completed its acquisition of Camco Financial.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL is increased through a provision for credit losses that is charged to earnings, based on Management™s quarterly 
evaluation of the factors disclosed in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries
, and the ACL associated with securitized or sold loans. 
During the 2015 first quarter, we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and enhanced certain processes 
and methods of ACL estimation. During this review, we analyzed the loss emergence periods used for consumer receivables 

collectively evaluated for impairment and, as a result, extended our loss emergence periods for products within these portfolio
s. As 
part of these enhancements to our credit reserve process, we also evaluated the methods used to separately estimate economic risks inherent in our portfolios and decided to no longer utilize these separate estimation techniques. Rather, we now incorporate ec
onomic risks in our loss estimates elsewhere in our reserve calculation. The enhancements made to our credit reserve processes during 
the quarter allow for increased segmentation and analysis of the estimated incurred losses within our loan portfolios. The net ACL 
impact of these enhancements was immaterial.124During the 2015 third quarter, we reviewed our existing commercial and consumer credit models and completed a periodic 
reassessment of certain ACL assumptions.  Specifically, we updated our analysis of the loss emergence periods used for commerci
al receivables collectively evaluated for impairment.  Based on our observed portfolio experience, we extended our loss emergence 

periods for the C&I portfolio and CRE portfolios.  We also updated loss factors in our consumer home equity and residential mor
tgage portfolios based on more recently observed portfolio experience.  The net ACL impact of these enhancements was immaterial.

Credit Quality Indicators
To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality for C&I and CRE loans, and for purposes of determining an appropriate ACL level 
for these loans, Huntington utilizes the following categories of credit grades:Pass - Higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below.
125OLEM - The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represent a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential 
weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect Huntington™s posi
tion in the future. For these reasons, Huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans.Substandard - Inadequately protected loans by the borrower™s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to 
secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is lik
ely Huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated.Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high.The categories above, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of the loan or lease and subsequently updated as appropriate.Commercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized loans. Commercial loans categorized as Substandard or Doubtful are also considered Classified loans.For all classes within all consumer loan portfolios, each loan is assigned a specific PD factor that is partially based on the borrower™s most recent credit bureau score, which we update quarterly. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by Fai
r IsaacCorporation based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of
 consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the highe
r likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality.
Huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described ab
ove, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit 
risk management processes.126The following table presents each loan and lease class by credit quality indicator for the years ended December 31, 2015 and

Impaired Loans
For all classes within the C&I and CRE portfolios, all loans with an outstanding balance of $1 million or greater are considered for individual evaluation on a quarterly basis for impairment . Generally, consumer loans within any class are not individually
 evaluated on a regular basis for impairment. However, certain home equity and residential mortgage loans are measured for 

impairment based on the underlying collateral value. All TDRs, regardless of the outstanding balance amount, are also considere
d to be impaired. Loans acquired with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination for which it is probable at acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected are also considered to be impaired.Once a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment, the loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. This determination requires significant judgment and use of estimates, and the eventual outcome may differ significa
ntly from those estimates.The following tables present the balance of the ALLL attributable to loans by portfolio segment individually and collectively 
evaluated for impairment and the related loan and lease balance for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (1):

TDR Concession Types
The Company™s standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements, 
cash flow analyses, and collateral valuations. Each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrower™s specific circumstances at a point in time. All commercial TDRs are reviewed and approved by our 

SAD. The types of concessions provided to borrowers include:
Ł Interest rate reduction: A reduction of the stated interest rate to a nonmarket rate for the remaining original life of the d
ebt.Ł Amortization or maturity date change beyond what the collateral supports, including any of the following:
Ł Lengthens the amortization period of the amortized principal beyond market terms. This concession reduces the 
minimum monthly payment and could increase the amount of the balloon payment at the end of the term of the 
loan. Principal is generally not forgiven.
Ł Reduces the amount of loan principal to be amortized and increases the amount of the balloon payment at the end 
of the term of the loan. This concession also reduces the minimum monthly payment. Principal is generally not 

forgiven.
Ł Extends the maturity date or dates of the debt beyond what the collateral supports. This concession generally 
applies to loans without a balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan.Ł Chapter 7 bankruptcy: A bankruptcy court™s discharge of a borrower™s debt is considered a concession when the borrower 
does not reaffirm the discharged debt.
132Ł Other: A concession that is not categorized as one of the concessions described above. These concessions include, but are not
 limited to: principal forgiveness, collateral concessions, covenant concessions, and reduction of accrued interest. Principal 

forgiveness may result from any TDR modification of any concession type. However, the aggregate amount of principal 

forgiven as a result of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was not significant.
Following is a description of TDRs by the different loan types:
Commercial loan TDRs
 Œ Commercial accruing TDRs often result from loans receiving a concession with terms that are not 
considered a market transaction to Huntington. The TDR remains in accruing status as long as the customer is less than 90-days 
past due on payments per the restructured loan terms and no loss is expected.Commercial nonaccrual TDRs result from either: (1) an accruing commercial TDR being placed on nonaccrual status, or 
(2) a workout where an existing commercial NAL is restructured and a concession is given. At times, these workouts restructure 
the NAL so that two or more new notes are created. The primary note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards an
d is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest. The terms on the secondary note(s)
 vary by situation, and may include notes that defer principal and interest payments until after the primary note is repaid. Creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project and allows Huntington to right-size a loan based upon the current expectations for a borrower™s or project™s performance.
Our strategy involving TDR borrowers includes working with these borrowers to allow them to refinance elsewhere, as 
well as allow them time to improve their financial position and remain our customer through refinancing their notes according to market terms and conditions in the future. A subsequent refinancing or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan ma
tures according to the terms of the TDR-modified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements. At that time, th
e loan is evaluated to determine if it is creditworthy. It is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for ot
her similar credit extensions, both new and existing. The refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a con
tinuation of the prior loan. A new loan is considered for removal of the TDR designation, whereas a continuation of the prior note requir
es a continuation of the TDR designation. In order for a TDR designation to be removed, the borrower must no longer be experiencing 

financial difficulties and the terms of the refinanced loan must not represent a concession.
Residential Mortgage loan TDRs Œ Residential mortgage TDRs represent loan modifications associated with traditional first-lien 
mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower. The primary concessions given to residential mortgage 

borrowers are amortization or maturity date changes and interest rate reductions. Residential mortgages identified as TDRs invo
lve borrowers unable to refinance their mortgages through the Company™s normal mortgage origination channels or through other 

independent sources. Some, but not all, of the loans may be delinquent.Automobile, Home Equity, and Other Consumer loan TDRs
 Œ The Company may make similar interest rate, term, and principal 
concessions as with residential mortgage loan TDRs.
TDR Impact on Credit QualityHuntington™s ALLL is largely determined by updated risk ratings assigned to commercial loans, updated borrower credit scores 
on consumer loans, and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. These updated risk ratings 
and credit scores consider the default history of the borrower, including payment redefaults. As such, the provision for credit los
ses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the TDR classification. TDRs can be classified as eit
her accrual or nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual TDRs are included in NALs whereas accruing TDRs are excluded from NALs as it is 

probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected.Our TDRs may include multiple concessions and the disclosure classifications are presented based on the primary concession 
provided to the borrower. The majority of our concessions for the C&I and CRE portfolios are the extension of the maturity date
 , but could also include an increase in the interest rate. In these instances, the primary concession is the maturity date extension.TDR concessions may also result in the reduction of the ALLL within the C&I and CRE portfolios. This reduction is derived 
from payments and the resulting application of the reserve calculation within the ALLL. The transaction reserve for non-TDR C&I
 and CRE loans is calculated based upon several estimated probability factors, such as PD and LGD, both of which were previously discussed. Upon the occurrence of a TDR in our C&I and CRE portfolios, the reserve is measured based on discounted expected cas
h flows or collateral value, less anticipated selling costs, of the modified loan in accordance with ASC 310-10. The resulting TD
R ALLL 
calculation often results in a lower ALLL amount because (1) the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value, less antic
ipated selling costs, indicate a lower estimated loss, (2) if the modification includes a rate increase, the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate, exceeds the carrying value of the loan, or (3) payments may occur as part of the modification. The ALLL for C&I and CRE loans may increase as a result of the modification, as the discounted cash flow anal
ysis may indicate additional reserves are required.TDR concessions on consumer loans may increase the ALLL. The concessions made to these borrowers often include interest 
rate reductions, and therefore, the TDR ALLL calculation results in a greater ALLL compared with the non-TDR calculation as the
 133reserve is measured based on the estimation of the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value, less anticipated selling costs, on the modified loan in accordance with ASC 310-10. The resulting TDR ALLL calculation often results in a higher ALLL amount 

because (1) the discounted expected cash flows or collateral value, less anticipated selling costs, indicate a higher estimated loss or, 
(2) due to the rate decrease, the discounting of the cash flows on the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate, indicates a reduction in the present value of expected cash flows or collateral value, less anticipated selling costs. In certain instances, the ALLL 
may decrease as a result of payments made in connection with the modification.Commercial loan TDRs
 Œ In instances where the bank substantiates that it will collect its outstanding balance in full, the note is considered for return to accrual status upon the borrower showing a sustained period of repayment performance for a six-month period of time. This six-month period could extend before or after the restructure date. If a charge-off was taken as part of the rest
ructuring, any interest or principal payments received on that note are applied to first reduce the bank™s outstanding book balance and th
en to recoveries of charged-off principal, unpaid interest, and/or fee expenses while the TDR is in nonaccrual status.
Residential Mortgage, Automobile, Home Equity, and Other Consumer loan TDRs
 Œ Modified loans identified as TDRs are 
aggregated into pools for analysis. Cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooled-loan level. Once the loans are aggregated into the pool, they continue to be classified as TDRs until contractually repaid or charge
d-off.
Residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency such as the FHA, VA, and the USDA, including TDR 
loans, are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status. Nonaccrual TDRs are those that are greater than 150
-days contractually past due. Loans guaranteed by U.S. government organizations continue to accrue interest on guaranteed rates upon 

delinquency.

Security ImpairmentHuntington evaluates the available-for-sale securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for impairment. We conduct a comprehensiv
e security-level assessment on all available-for-sale securities. Impairment would exist when the present value of the expected c
ash flows are not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances, any i
mpairment would be recognized in earnings. The contractual terms and/or cash flows of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle 
the securities at a price less than the amortized cost. Huntington does not intend to sell, nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities until the amortized cost is recovered, which may be maturity. 
The highest risk segment in our investment portfolio is the trust preferred CDO securities which are in the asset-backed securities portfolio. This portfolio is in run off, and we have not purchased these types of securities since 2005. The fair va
lues of the CDO assets have been impacted by various market conditions. The unrealized losses are primarily the result of wider liquidity s
preads on asset-backed securities and the longer expected average lives of the trust-preferred CDO securities, due to changes in the 
expectations of when the underlying securities will be repaid.Collateralized Debt Obligations are backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. The collateral genera
lly consists of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance 
companies. Many collateral issuers have the option of deferring interest payments on their debt for up to five years. A full ca
sh flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio. A third-party pricing s
pecialist with direct industry experience in pooled-trust-preferred security evaluations is engaged to provide assistance estimating the fair value and expected cash flows on this portfolio. The full cash flow analysis is completed by evaluating the relevant credit and struc
tural aspects of each pooled-trust-preferred security in the portfolio, including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the security and terms of the security™s structure. The credit review includes an analysis of profitability, credit quality,
 operating efficiency, leverage, and liquidity using available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer.
 The 
analysis also includes a review of historical industry default data, current / near term operating conditions, and the impact of macroeconomic and regulatory changes. Using the results of our analysis, we estimate appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral then estimate the expected cash flows for each security. The fair value of each security is obtain
ed by discounting the expected cash flows at a market discount rate. The market discount rate is determined by reference to yields ob
served in the market for similarly rated collateralized debt obligations, specifically high-yield collateralized loan obligations. The
 relatively high market discount rate is reflective of the uncertainty of the cash flows and illiquid nature of these securities. The large
 differential 
between the fair value and amortized cost of some of the securities reflects the high market discount rate and the expectation that the majority of the cash flows will not be received until near the final maturity of the security (the final maturities range from 2032 to 2035).On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, generally to become effective on July 21, 2015. The Volcker Rule 

prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates (referred to as ﬁbanking entitiesﬂ) from: (i) engaging in ﬁpropr
ietary tradingﬂ and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (ﬁcovered fundsﬂ) subject to certain limited exceptions. Th
ese prohibitions impact the ability of U.S. banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with non-U.S. banking organizations in overseas markets. The rule also effectively prohibit
s short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading.On January 14, 2014, the five federal agencies approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the investment prohibitions of section 619 of the Volcker Rule. Under the interim final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered f
unds by banking entities if certain qualifications are met. In addition, the agencies released a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the 140requirements of the interim final rule. At December 31, 2015, we had investments in eight different pools of trust preferred 
securities. Seven of our pools are included in the list of non-exclusive issuers. We have analyzed the ICONS pool that was not 

included on the list and believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to hold the ICONS security to recovery under the final Volcker Rule regulations.
The following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of our CDO securities portfolio, which are included in asset-backed securities, at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Each security is part of a pool of issuers and supports a more senior tranche of securities except for the MM Comm III securities which are the most senior class.Collateralized Debt Obligation Securities(dollar amounts in thousands)Deal NamePar Value

(56,456)(1) Security was determined to have OTTI. As such, the book value is net of recorded credit impairment.
(2) The majority of securities have been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer.

(3) For purposes of comparability, the lowest credit rating expressed is equivalent to Fitch ratings even where the lowest rati
ng is based on another nationally recognized credit rating agency.
(4) Includes both banks and/or insurance companies.

(5) Excess subordination percentage represents the additional defaults in excess of both current and projected defaults that th
e CDO can absorb before the bond experiences credit impairment. Excess subordinated percentage is calculated by 
(a) determining what percentage of defaults a deal can experience before the bond has credit impairment, and (b) subtracting 
from this default breakage percentage both total current and expected future default percentages.For the periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the following table summarizes by security type, the total OTTI losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for securities evaluated for impairment as described above:  Year ended December 31,(dollar amounts in thousands)201520142013

5. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES
These are debt securities that Huntington has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. The debt securities are carried at
 amortized cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method.During 2015, Huntington transferred $3.0 billion of federal agencies, mortgage-backed securities and other agency securities from the available-for-sale securities portfolio to the held-to-maturity securities portfolio. At the time of the transfer, $6 milli
on of unrealized net gains were recognized in OCI.  The amounts in OCI will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the 

securities as an offset to the adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of the premium on the same tran
sferred securities, resulting in an immaterial impact on net income.Listed below are the contractual maturities (under 1 year, 1-5 years, 6-10 years, and over 10 years) of held-to-maturity securi
ties at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014: 142December 31, 2015December 31, 2014

Security ImpairmentHuntington evaluates the held-to-maturity securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for impairment. Impairment would exist when the present value of the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis at the balance sheet 
date. Under these circumstances, any impairment would be recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Management evaluated 

held-to-maturity securities with unrealized losses for impairment and concluded no OTTI is required.6. LOAN SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs occur, the precise terms and 
conditions are typically not readily available. Therefore, the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future cash f
low model. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related to prepaym
ents, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, costs to service, and other economic factors. Changes in the assumpt
ions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of MSRs.MSR values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments. Huntington hedges the value of certain MSRs against changes in value attributable to changes in interest rates using a combination of derivative 
instruments and trading securities.For MSRs under the fair value method, a summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR value to changes in these assumptions at December 31, 2015, and 2014 follows:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014

Total servicing, late and other ancillary fees included in mortgage banking income was $47 million, $44 million, and $44 millio
n for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Total amortization and impairment of capitalized servicin
g assets included in mortgage banking income was $27 million, $24 million, and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  The unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was $16.2 
billion, $15.6 billion, and $15.2 billion at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
Automobile Loans and LeasesThe following table summarizes activity relating to automobile loans sold and/or securitized with servicing retained for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:  Year Ended December 31,(dollar amounts in thousands)20152014 (1)2013 (1)

(2) Recorded in gain on sale of loans
In the 2015 second quarter, the UPB of automobile loans totaling $750 million were transferred to a trust in a securitization 
transaction in exchange for $780 million of net proceeds. The securitization and resulting sale of all underlying securities qu
alified for sale accounting. As a result of this transaction, Huntington recognized a $5 million gain which is reflected in gain on sale of
 loans on the Consolidated Statements of Income and recorded an $11 million servicing asset which is reflected in accrued income and othe
r assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Huntington has retained servicing responsibilities on sold automobile loans and receives annual servicing fees and other ancillary fees on the outstanding loan balances. Automobile loan servicing rights are accounted for using the amortization meth
od. A 
servicing asset is established at fair value at the time of the sale. The servicing asset is then amortized against servicing i
ncome. Impairment, if any, is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as determined by calculating the present value of 

expected net future cash flows. The primary risk characteristic for measuring servicing assets is payoff rates of the underlyin
g loan pools. Valuation calculations rely on the predicted payoff assumption and, if actual payoff is quicker than expected, then futu
re value would be impaired.Changes in the carrying value of automobile loan servicing rights for the years ended  December 31, 2015, and 2014, and the fair value at the end of each period were as follows: (dollar amounts in thousands)20152014

7. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Business segments are based on segment leadership structure, which reflects how segment performance is monitored and assessed. We have five major business segments: Retail and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Automobile Finance and 

Commercial Real Estate (AFCRE), Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG), and Home Lending. A 

Treasury / Other function includes, along with technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and e
xpense. All periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification. During 2014, we realigned our business segments to drive our ongoing growth and leverage the knowledge of our highly experienced team.  Amounts relating to the 

realignment are disclosed in the table below.

On March 31, 2015, Huntington completed its acquisition of Macquarie Equipment Finance, which was re-branded Huntington Technology Finance. As part of the transaction, Huntington recorded $156 million of goodwill and $8 million of other intangible
 assets. For additional information on the acquisition, see Note 23 Business Combinations.During 2015, Huntington adjusted the goodwill in the RBHPCG segment related to a sale of HASI and HAA.  The amount was 
adjusted based on relative fair value methodology.
In 2014, Huntington completed an acquisition of 24 Bank of America branches in Michigan and recorded $17 million of 
goodwill. The remaining $64 million of goodwill acquired during 2014 was the result of the Camco Financial acquisition, which w
as also completed in 2014.Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at October 1 of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As a result of the 2014 first quarter reorganizati
on in our reported business segments, goodwill was reallocated among the business segments. Immediately following the reallocation, 
impairment of $3 million was recorded in the Home Lending reporting segment. No impairment was recorded in 2015 or 2013.Also in 2014, we moved our insurance brokerage business from Treasury / Other to Commercial Banking to align with a change 
in management responsibilities. Amounts relating to the realignment are disclosed in the table above.

15412. SHAREHOLDERS™ EQUITY
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
In 2008, Huntington issued 569,000 shares of 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A 
Preferred Stock) with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting an
d may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 83.668 shares of common stock of Huntington, which represents an 

approximate initial conversion price of $11.95 per share of common stock. Since April 15, 2013, at the option of Huntington, th
e Series A Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory conversion into Huntington™s common stock at the prevailing conversion rate if
 the closing price of Huntington™s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive 

trading-day period. At the option of the holder, one share was converted to common stock during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In 2011, Huntington issued $36 million par value Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a 
liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock) and, in certain cases, an additional amount of cash 
consideration, in exchange for $36 million of (1) Huntington Capital I Floating Rate Capital Securities, (2) Huntington Capital II Floating Rate Capital Securities, (3) Sky Financial Capital Trust III Floating Rate Capital Securities and (4) Sky Financial Ca
pital Trust IV Floating Rate Capital Securities.
As part of the exchange offer, Huntington issued depositary shares. Each depositary share represents a 1/40th ownership interes
t in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock. Each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock and all the related rights and preferences. Huntington will pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.70%. The preferred stock was recorded at the par amount 
of $36 million, with the difference between par amount of the shares and their fair value of $24 million recorded as a discount.
2015 Share Repurchase Program
On March 11, 2015, Huntington announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to the proposed capital actions included in 
Huntington™s capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2015. These actions included a potential repurchase of up
 to $366 million of common stock from the second quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Purchases of common stock may 
include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated repurchase programs. Huntington™s board of 

directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with Huntington™s capital plan. This program replaced the previously
 authorized share repurchase program authorized by Huntington™s board of directors in 2014.
During 2015, Huntington repurchased a total of 23.0 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $10.93.  Huntington has the ability to repurchase up to $166 million of additional common stock through the second quarter of 2016. On January 26, 2016, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit 
Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction.  The transactio
n is expected to be completed in the 2016 third quarter, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regu
latory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation. As a result, Huntington no longer has 
the intent to repurchase shares under the current authorization. 2014 Share Repurchase Program
During 2014, Huntington repurchased a total of 35.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $9.37.13. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Pote
ntially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, distributions from deferred compensation plans, and the conversion of the Company™s convertible preferred stock (See Note 12). Potentially dilutiv
e common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilut
ive. For diluted earnings per share, net income available to common shares can be affected by the conversion of the Company™s conver
tible preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion would be dilutive, net income available to common shareholders is adjusted
 by the associated preferred dividends and deemed dividend. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for each of the thr
ee years ended December 31 was as follows: 155 Year ended December 31,(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)201520142013

Approximately 1.6 million, 2.6 million, and 6.6 million options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding at the end of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
 effect would be antidilutive.
14. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Huntington sponsors nonqualified and incentive share based compensation plans. These plans provide for the granting of stock 
options and other awards to officers, directors, and other employees. Compensation costs are included in personnel costs on the
 Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock options are granted at the closing market price on the date of the grant. Options granted typically vest ratably over four years or when other conditions are met. Stock options, which represented a portion of our grant values, have no intrinsic value until the stock price increases.  Options granted on or after May 1, 2015 have a contractual term of te
n years. All options granted on or before April 30, 2015 have a contractual term of seven years.  
2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In 2015, shareholders approved the Huntington Bancshares Incorporated 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan). 
Shares remaining under the 2012 Plan have been incorporated into the 2015 Plan and reduced the full number of shares covered by all awards. Accordingly, the total number of shares authorized for awards under the 2015 Plan is 30 million shares. At December 31,
 2015, 25 million shares from the Plan were available for future grants. Huntington issues shares to fulfill stock option exercises and restricted stock unit and award vesting from available authorized common shares. At December 31, 2015, Huntington believes ther
e are adequate authorized common shares to satisfy anticipated stock option exercises and restricted stock unit and award vesting in 2016. Huntington uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value options in determining our share-based compensation expense. Forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant based on historical rates, and updated as necessary, and reduce the compensation
 expense recognized. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. The expected 
dividend yield is based on the dividend rate and stock price at the date of the grant. Expected volatility is based on the estimated volatility of Huntington™s stock over the expected term of the option.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the amount by which the fair value of underlying stock exceeds the ﬁin-the-moneyﬂ option exercise price. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, cash received for the exercises of stock options was $26 million, $21 million and $14 million, respectively. The tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises t
otaled $7 million, $4 million and $2 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested shares granted for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $10.86, $9.09, and $7.12, respectively. The total fair value of awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 20

Huntington also grants restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share awards, and other stock-based awards. Restricted stock units and awards are issued at no cost to the recipient, and can be settled only in shares at the end of the vesting period. Restricted stock awards provide the holder with full voting rights and cash dividends during the vesting period. Restricted stock units do not provide the holder with voting rights or cash dividends during the vesting period, but do accrue a dividend 
equivalent that is paid upon vesting, and are subject to certain service restrictions. Performance share awards are payable contingent upon Huntington achieving certain predefined performance objectives over the three-year measurement period. The fair value of t
hese awards is the closing market price of Huntington™s common stock on the grant date.

15. BENEFIT PLANS
Huntington sponsors the Plan, a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to January 1, 2010. The Plan, which was modified in 2013 and no longer accrues service benefits to participants, 
provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. The funding policy of Huntington is to contribute an annual amou
nt that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements but not more than the amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. There were no required minimum contributions during 2015. During the 2013 third quarter, the board of directors approved, and 

management communicated, a curtailment of the Company™s pension plan effective December 31, 2013.
In addition, Huntington has an unfunded defined benefit post-retirement plan that provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service under this plan. For any employee retiring on or after January 1, 1993, post-retirement healthcare benefits are based upon the employee™s number of mont
hs of service and are limited to the actual cost of coverage. Life insurance benefits are a percentage of the employee™s base salary 
at the time of retirement, with a maximum of $50,000 of coverage. The employer paid portion of the post-retirement health and life insuranc
e plan was eliminated for employees retiring on and after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees retiring on and after March 1, 2010, who elect retiree medical coverage, will pay the full cost of this coverage. Huntington will not provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring on and after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees will be able to convert or port their existing life insurance at their own expense under the same terms that are available to all terminated employees.On January 1, 2015, Huntington terminated the company sponsored retiree health care plan for Medicare eligible retirees and their dependents. Instead, Huntington will partner with a third-party to assist the retirees and their dependents in selecting individual 158policies from a variety of carriers on a private exchange. This plan amendment resulted in a measurement of the liability at th
e approval date. The result of the measurement was a $5 million reduction of the liability and increase in accumulated other 

comprehensive income. It will also result in a reduction of expense over the estimated life of plan participants.The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 and 
2014, and the net periodic benefit cost for the years then ended:PensionBenefitsPost-RetirementBenefits2015201420152014

January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015, and was changed to 3.77% for the period from September 30, 2015 to December 31, 
2015.The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-te
rm rate of return is established at the beginning of the plan year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets.The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation of the Plan and the post-retirement benefit plan with the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31: PensionBenefitsPost-RetirementBenefits(dollar amounts in thousands)2015201420152014

Included in benefit costs are $4 million, $2 million, and $2 million of plan expenses that were recognized in the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. It is Huntington™s policy to recognize settlement gains and losses as incurred. Assumi
ng no cash contributions are made to the Plan during 2016, Management expects net periodic pension benefit, excluding any expense of settlements, to approximate $2 million for 2016. The postretirement medical and life subsidy was eliminated for anyone who reti
res on or after March 1, 2010. As such, there were no incremental net periodic post-retirement benefits costs associated with this pla
n.The estimated transition obligation, prior service credit, and net actuarial loss for the plans that will be amortized from OCI into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is zero, $2 million, and a $8 million benefit, respectively.
At December 31, 2015 and 2014, The Huntington National Bank, as trustee, held all Plan assets. The Plan assets consisted of 
investments in a variety of corporate and government fixed income investments, money market funds, and Huntington mutual funds as follows:160 Fair Value(dollar amounts in thousands)20152014

Fair value of plan assets$594,217100%$653,013100%
Investments of the Plan are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value.  The valuation methodologie
s used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets vary depending on the type of asset. For an explanation of the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 1 ﬁSignificant Accounting Policiesﬂ under the heading ﬁFair Value Measurementsﬂ.  At December 31, 2015
, equities and money market funds are classified as Level 1; mutual funds-fixed income, corporate obligations, U.S. government 
obligations, and U.S. government agencies are classified as Level 2; and limited partnerships are classified as Level 3. In general, investments of the Plan are exposed to various risks such as interest rate risk, credit risk, and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments, it is reasonably possible changes in the values of in
vestments will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Plan assets. 
The investment objective of the Plan is to maximize the return on Plan assets over a long-time period, while meeting the Plan obligations. At December 31, 2015, Plan assets were invested 3% in cash and cash equivalents, 45% in equity investments, and 52
% in bonds, with an average duration of 12.2 years on bond investments. The estimated life of benefit obligations was 11.9 years. Al
though it may fluctuate with market conditions, Management has targeted a long-term allocation of Plan assets of 20% to 50% in equity 

investments and 80% to 50% in bond investments. The allocation of Plan assets between equity investments and fixed income 

investments will change from time to time with the allocation to fixed income investments increasing as the funding level increases.The following table shows the number of shares and dividends received on shares of Huntington stock held by the Plan:December 31,(dollar amounts in thousands, except share amounts)20152014

Although not required, a cash contribution can be made to the Plan up to the maximum deductible limit in the plan year. 
Anticipated contributions for 2016 to the post-retirement benefit plan are zero.161The 2016 healthcare cost trend rate is projected to be 7.0% for participants. This rate is assumed to decrease gradually until 
it reaches 4.5% in the year 2028 and remain at that level thereafter. Huntington updated the immediate healthcare cost trend rate 

assumption based on current market data and Huntington™s claims experience. This trend rate is expected to decline over time to
 a trend level consistent with medical inflation and long-term economic assumptions.Huntington also sponsors other nonqualified retirement plans, the most significant being the SERP and the SRIP. The SERP 
provides certain former officers and directors, and the SRIP provides certain current and former officers and directors of Hunt
ington and its subsidiaries with defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal tax law. At December 31, 2015 and 201
4, Huntington has an accrued pension liability of $34 million and $35 million, respectively, associated with these plans. Pension 
expense for the plans was $1 million, $1 million, and $4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. During the 2013 third quarter, 
the board of directors approved, and management communicated, a curtailment of the Company™s SRIP plan effective December 31, 2013.

16. INCOME TAXES
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, city, and foreign 
jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed through 2009. The IRS is currently examining our 2010 and 2011 

consolidated federal income tax returns. Various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Ohio, Kent
ucky, 
Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Illinois.
Huntington accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.  At December 31, 2015, 
Huntington had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $23 million in income tax liability related to uncertain tax positions. Due to the complexities of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from 
the current estimate of the tax liabilities. Huntington does not anticipate the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits to 
significantly change within the next 12 months.The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits: (dollar amounts in thousands)20152014

Gross increases for tax positions taken during prior yearsŠ468
Gross decreases for tax positions taken during prior years(1,172)ŠUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year$23,104$1,172
Any interest and penalties on income tax assessments or income tax refunds are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of provision for income taxes. Huntington recognized, $0.1 million of interest benefit, $0.1 million of interest expense, and $0.2 million of interest benefit for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Total interes
t 163accrued was $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All of the gross unrecognized tax benefi
ts would impact the Company™s effective tax rate if recognized.

At December 31, 2015, Huntington™s net deferred tax asset related to loss and other carryforwards was $63 million. This was 
comprised of federal net operating loss carryforwards of $3 million, which will begin expiring in 2023, $45 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin expiring in 2016, an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $1 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely, a general business credit carryforward of $1 million, which will begin expiring in 2031, a
nd a capital loss carryforward of $13 million, which expires in 2018.In prior periods, Huntington established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for federal capital loss carryforwards, state deferred tax assets, and state net operating loss carryforwards. The federal valuation allowance was based on the uncerta
inty of forecasted federal taxable income expected of the required character in order to utilize the capital loss carryforward. The sta
te valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards. Based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted taxable income of the appropriate character and/or within applicable jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is more likely than not the federal capital loss carryforward, and portions of the state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized. As a result of this analysis, there is no federal capital loss carryforward valu
ation allowance remaining at December 31, 2015 compared to $69 million at December 31, 2014, and the state valuation allowance of $4 
million  at December 31, 2015 was essentially unchanged compared to $4 million at December 31, 2014.At December 31, 2015 retained earnings included approximately $12 million of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions, for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized. Under current law, if these bad debt reserves are used 
for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at the current corporate rate. The am
ount of unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to the cumulative bad debt deduction was approximately $4 million at December 31, 
2015.16517. FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Mortgage loans held for saleHuntington has elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product types.Mortgage loans held for investmentMortgages are loans originated with the intent to sell and are measured at fair value with adjustments recognized through the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year, certain mortgage loans have been reclassified to mortgage loans held for 

investment. These loans continue to be measured at fair value. The fair value is determined using fair value of mortgage-backed
 securities adjusted for loan specific variables.Available-for-sale securities and trading account securities
Securities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading portfolios. Huntington uses prices 
obtained from third-party pricing services and recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. AFS and trading securit
ies are classified as Level 1 using quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical securities that Huntington has the ability to access at the measurement date. Less than 1% of the positions in these portfolios are Level 1, and consist of U.S. 
Treasury securities and money market mutual funds. When quoted market prices are not available, fair values are classified as 

Level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the fin
ancial instrument. 74% of the positions in these portfolios are Level 2, and consist of U.S. Government and agency debt securities, 
agency mortgage backed securities, asset-backed securities, municipal securities and other securities. For Level 2 securities 
management uses various methods and techniques to corroborate prices obtained from the pricing service, including references to dealer or other market quotes, and by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments. If relevant market prices are limited or 
unavailable, valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value, in which case the fair values are classified as Level 3. 26% of our positions are Level 3, and consist of private-label CMO securities, CDO-preferred 
securities and municipal securities. A significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a signi
ficant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securities.The municipal securities portion that is classified as Level 3 uses significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity. The fair value is determined by utilizing third-party valuation services. The
 third-party service provider reviews credit worthiness, prevailing market rates, analysis of similar securities, and projected cash flows. The third-party service provider also incorporates industry and general economic conditions into their analysis. Huntington 
evaluates the analysis provided for reasonableness.The private label CMO and CDO-preferred securities portfolios are classified as Level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity. The private label CMO securiti
es portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of the CDO-preferred securities 
portfolio are reviewed quarterly. These reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a b
asis for impairment analysis.Private-label CMO securities are collateralized by first-lien residential mortgage loans. The securities valuation methodology 
incorporates values obtained from a third-party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market 
conditions. The model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, default rates that are implied by th
e underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures, house price depreciation / appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar 
collateral structures.  The Private-label CMO securities were sold during the 2015 third quarter.  
CDO-preferred securities are CDOs backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. The collateral 
generally consists of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and 
insurance companies. A cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this 

portfolio. We engage a third-party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in CDO-preferred securities valuations to
 provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. The PD of each iss
uer 166and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value. Management evaluates the PD assumptions provided by the third-party pricing specialist by comparing the current PD to the assumptions used the previous quarter, actual
 defaults and deferrals in the current period, and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers. Huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates. Relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value.Automobile loansEffective January 1, 2010, Huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for 
as an off-balance sheet transaction. As a result, Huntington elected to account for these automobile loan receivables at fair v
alue per guidance supplied in ASC 825. The automobile loan receivables are classified as Level 3. The key assumptions used to 

determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the 
underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads. Certain interest rates are available from similarly traded securities while other interest rates are developed internally based on similar asset-backed security transactions in the market. During the first quarter of 2014, Huntington canceled the 2009 and 2006 Automobile Trusts. Huntington continues to 

report the associated automobile loan receivables at fair value due to its 2010 election.MSRsMSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, the fair value of these assets is classified
 as Level 3. Huntington determines the fair value of MSRs using an income approach model based upon our month-end interest rate 
curve and prepayment assumptions. The model utilizes assumptions to estimate future net servicing income cash flows, including 

estimates of time decay, payoffs, and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. Servicing brokers and other sources of 

information (e.g. discussion with other mortgage servicers and industry surveys) are used to obtain information on market practice and assumptions. On at least a quarterly basis, third-party marks are obtained from at least one servicing broker. Huntington 

reviews the valuation assumptions against this market data for reasonableness and adjusts the assumptions if deemed appropriate. Any recommended change in assumptions and/or inputs are presented for review to the Mortgage Price Risk Subcommittee for 
final approval.Derivative assets and liabilitiesDerivatives classified as Level 2 consist of foreign exchange and commodity contracts, which are valued using exchange traded swaps and futures market data. In addition, Level 2 includes interest rate contracts, which are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates. Level 2 also includes exchange traded options and forward 
commitments to deliver mortgage-backed securities, which are valued using quoted prices.Derivatives classified as Level 3 consist of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments. The 
determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant unobservable assumption. A significant increase or decrease in the external market price would result in
 a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.Short-term borrowingsShort-term borrowings classified as Level 2 consist primarily of U.S. treasury bond securities sold under agreement to repurchase. These securities are borrowed from other institutions and must be repaid by purchasing the securities in the open 

market.  Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

The classification of an item as Level 3 is 
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 measurements may also 

include observable components of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below 

include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

Assets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are s
ubject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. For the year ended December 31, 

2015, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows:172Fair Value Measurements Using(dollar amounts in thousands)Fair ValueQuoted PricesIn ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)SignificantOtherUnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalGains/(Losses) Year endedDecember 31, 2015MSRs$141,726$Š$Š$141,726$(2,732)

MSRs accounted for under the amortization method are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement when the fair value is lower than the carrying amount.Periodically, Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans measured for impairment when 
establishing the ACL. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. 

Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized.
Other real estate owned properties are included in accrued income and other assets and valued based on appraisals and third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs.The appraisals supporting the fair value of the collateral to recognize loan impairment or unrealized loss on other real estate owned properties may not have been obtained as of December 31, 2015.Significant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis

The following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below.
173A significant change in the unobservable inputs may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of 
Level 3 instruments. In general, prepayment rates increase when market interest rates decline and decrease when market interest rates rise and higher prepayment rates generally result in lower fair values for MSR assets, Private-label CMO securities, Asse
t-backed securities, and Automobile loans.
Credit loss estimates, such as probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying coll
ateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing 
when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losse
s and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve.Discount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values.Net market price and pull through percentages generally increase when market interest rates increase and decline when market interest rates decline. Higher net market price and pull through percentages generally result in higher fair values.Fair values of financial instruments

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include 
trading account securities, customers™ acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, FHLB 

advances, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, 
variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington™s exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly,
 their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value. Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment, do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage and nonmortgage 

servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer relationship intangibles are not considered financial instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair value information is not intended to, and does not, represent Huntington™s underlying va
lue. Many of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by Management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not 

limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates.The following methods and assumptions were used by Huntington to estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial instruments:Held-to-maturity securitiesFair values are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, and interest rate spreads on relevant benchmar
k securities.Loans and Direct Financing LeasesVariable-rate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying amounts, as adjusted for estimated credit losses. The fair 
values for other loans and leases are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates currently being 
offered for loans and leases with similar terms. The rates take into account the position of the yield curve, as well as an adj
ustment for prepayment risk, operating costs, and profit. This value is also reduced by an estimate of expected losses and the credit r
isk associated in the loan and lease portfolio. The valuation of the loan portfolio reflected discounts that Huntington believed ar
e consistent with transactions occurring in the marketplace.DepositsDemand deposits, savings accounts, and money market deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair values of fixed-rate time deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being offere
d on certificates with similar maturities.DebtLong-term debt is based upon quoted market prices, which are inclusive of Huntington™s credit risk. In the absence of quoted 
market prices, discounted cash flows using market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used in the determination of fair value.17518. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or a liability (in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value.Derivative financial instruments can be designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Designating a derivative as an accounting 
hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses, less any ineffectiveness, in the income statement within the same period
 that the hedged item affects earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated to an effective hedge relationship un
der GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur.
Derivatives used in Asset and Liability Management Activities
Huntington engages in balance sheet hedging activity, principally for asset liability management purposes, to convert fixed rat
e assets or liabilities into floating rate or vice versa. Balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and subordinated and other long-term debt from fixed-rate obligations to floating rate. Cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans.The following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington™s asset and liability management 
activities at December 31, 2015, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments: (dollar amounts in thousands)Fair Value HedgesCash Flow HedgesTotal

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Consequently, net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest be
aring liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. The net amounts resulted in an increas
e to net interest income of $108 million, $98 million, and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
In connection with the sale of Huntington™s Class B Visa
® shares, Huntington entered into a swap agreement with the purchaser of the shares. The swap agreement adjusts for dilution in the conversion ratio of Class B shares resulting from the Visa
® litigation. At 
December 31, 2015, the fair value of the swap liability of less than $1 million is an estimate of the exposure liability based upon Huntington™s assessment of the potential Visa
® litigation losses.The following table presents the fair values at December 31, 2015 and 2014 of Huntington™s derivatives that are designated and

Derivatives used in mortgage banking activitiesMortgage loan origination hedging activityHuntington™s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers 
and the secondary sale to third parties.  The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is commi
tted or locked. The interest rate lock commitments are derivative positions offset by forward commitments to sell loans.  
Huntington uses two types of mortgage-backed securities in its forward commitment to sell loans.  The first type of forward 
commitment is a ﬁTo Be Announcedﬂ (or TBA), the second is a ﬁSpecified Poolﬂ mortgage-backed security. Huntington uses these 

derivatives to hedge the value of mortgage-backed securities until they are sold. The following table summarizes the derivative assets and liabilities used in mortgage banking activities: (dollar amounts in thousands)December 31, 2015December 31, 2014

MSR hedging activityHuntington™s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to 
mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility
, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps.
The total notional value of these derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. The total notional amount at December 31, 2015 corresponds to trading assets with a fair value of less t
han $1 million and trading liabilities with a fair value of $1 million. Net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $(2) million, $7 million, and $(25) million, respectively. These amounts are included i
n mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.178Derivatives used in trading activitiesVarious derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and f
or their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consisted of commodity, interest ra
te, and foreign exchange contracts. The derivative contracts grant the option holder the right to buy or sell an underlying financial i
nstrument for a predetermined price before the contract expires. Huntington may enter into offsetting third-party contracts with approved
, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities.The interest rate risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with o
ther counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency
 derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in l
iquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions.The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, were $76 million and $74 million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, includin
g offsetting derivatives, were $14.6 billion and $14.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Huntingt
on™s 
credit risks from interest rate swaps used for trading purposes were $224 million and $219 million at the same dates, respectively.
Risk Participation Agreements
Huntington periodically enters into risk participation agreement in order to manage credit risk of its derivative positions. Th
ese agreements transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to and from other financial institutions.  Huntington can mitigate exposure to certain counterparties or take on exposure to generate additional income. Huntington™s notional exposure f
or interest rate swaps originated by other financial institutions was $344 million and $457 million at December 31, 2015 and 
December 31, 2014, respectively. Huntington will make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation 
to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. The amount Huntington will have to pay if all 

counterparties defaulted on their swap contracts is the fair value of these risk participations, which was $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These contracts mature between 2015 and 2043 and are deemed investment 

grade.Financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
Huntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 17. Huntington records these derivatives net of any master netting arrangement in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Collateral agreements are regularly entered into as part of the 
underlying derivative agreements with Huntington™s counterparties to mitigate counterparty credit risk.
All derivatives are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterp
arties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington™s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure 
and credit risk for each of these groups.Huntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of 
transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchange cash and high quality securities collateral with these counterparties. Huntington enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment and risk management needs. These types of transactions 

generally are low dollar volume. Huntington generally enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties, however collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties.At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, aggregate credit risk associated with these derivatives, net of collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty, was $15 million and $20 million, respectively. The credit risk associated with interest rate 
swaps is calculated after considering master netting agreements with broker-dealers and banks.
At December 31, 2015, Huntington pledged $110 million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while 
other counterparties pledged $107 million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral.The following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts

19. VIEsConsolidated VIEsConsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2015, consisted of certain loan and lease securitization trusts. Huntington has determined 
the trusts are VIEs. Huntington has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of these trusts because it has the power to di
rect the activities of the entity that most significantly affect the entity™s economic performance and it has either the obligation to a
bsorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could pote
ntially be significant to the VIE. During the 2015 first quarter, Huntington acquired two securitization trusts with its acquisition of Hu
ntington Technology Finance.

2015-1, 2012-1, 2012-2 , and 2011 AUTOMOBILE TRUST
During 2015 second quarter, 2012 first and fourth quarters, and 2011 third quarter, we transferred automobile loans totaling $0
.8 billion, $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively to trusts in separate securitization transactions. The secu
ritizations and the resulting sale of all underlying securities qualified for sale accounting. Huntington has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these trusts because it has neither the obligation to absorb losses of the entities that could potentially be significant to the VIEs nor the right to receive benefits from the entities that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Huntington is n
ot required and does not currently intend to provide any additional financial support to the trusts. Investors and creditors only have recourse to the assets held by the trusts. The interest Huntington holds in the VIEs relates to servicing rights which are included within accr
ued income and other assets of Huntington™s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying valu
e of the servicing asset.During the 2015 third quarter, Huntington canceled the 2011 Automobile Trust. As a result, any remaining assets at the time of 
the cancellation were no longer part of the trust.TOWER HILL SECURITIES, INC.
In 2010, we transferred approximately $92 million of municipal securities, $86 million in Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (Real Estate Investment Trust) Class E Preferred Stock and cash of $6 million to Tower Hill Securities, Inc. in exchange for $1
84 million of Common and Preferred Stock of Tower Hill Securities, Inc. 
In 2015, the mandatorily redeemable securities issued by Tower Hill Securities, Inc. were redeemed in full.  As of November 16,
 2015, Tower Hill Securities, Inc. is a 100% owned consolidated entity.
TRUST-PREFERRED SECURITIES
Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within 
Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred 

securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in 
Huntington™s Consolidated Balance Sheet as subordinated notes. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as s
uch, are not consolidated within Huntington™s Consolidated Financial Statements. A list of trust-preferred securities outstanding at

Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time, or from time-to-time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures. During any such 
extension period, distributions to the trust securities will also be deferred and Huntington™s ability to pay dividends on its 
common stock will be restricted. Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of paym
ent to all indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as the junior subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation o
n the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by Huntington.LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PARTNERSHIPS
Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing 
the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments
 is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and 
to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the 

identification, development, and operation of multi family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally,
 these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity.
Huntington is a limited partner in each Low Income Housing Tax Credit Partnership. A separate unrelated third-party is the 
general partner. Each limited partnership is managed by the general partner, who exercises full and exclusive control over the 
affairs of 
the limited partnership. The general partner has all the rights, powers and authority granted or permitted to be granted to a g
eneral partner of a limited partnership under the Ohio Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Duties entrusted to the general partne
r of each limited partnership include, but are not limited to: investment in operating companies, company expenditures, investment of excess funds, borrowing funds, employment of agents, disposition of fund property, prepayment and refinancing of liabilities, v
otes and consents, contract authority, disbursement of funds, accounting methods, tax elections, bank accounts, insurance, litigatio
n, cash reserve, and use of working capital reserve funds. Except for limited rights granted to consent to certain transactions, the limited partner(s) may not participate in the operation, management, or control of the limited partnership™s business, transact any bus
iness in the limited partnership™s name or have any power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the limited partnership. In addition, 
the general partner may only be removed by the limited partner(s) in the event the general partner fails to comply with the terms of the agreement and/or is negligent in performing its duties.Huntington believes the general partner of each limited partnership has the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of each partnership, therefore, Huntington has determined that it is not the primary benef
iciary of any LIHTC partnership. Huntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in accrued income and other assets. Investments that do not meet the requirements of t
he proportional amortization method are recognized using the equity method. Investment losses related to these investments are included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.The following table presents the balances of Huntington™s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded

ncome.Huntington recognized immaterial impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The impairment 
losses recognized related to the fair value of the tax credit investments that were less than carrying value.OTHER INVESTMENTSOther investments determined to be VIE™s include investments in New Market Tax Credit Investments, Historic Tax Credit 
Investments, Small Business Investment Companies, Rural Business Investment Companies, certain equity method investments and 
other miscellaneous investments.20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Commitments to extend credit
In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these financial agreements at December 31, 2015, and December 31, 

2014 were as follows:  At December 31,(dollar amounts in thousands)20152014
Contract amount represents credit riskCommitments to extend credit:Commercial$11,448,927$11,181,522

Consumer8,574,0937,579,632
Commercial real estate813,271908,112
Standby letters of credit511,706497,457
Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer™s cr
edit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing 
market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to
 expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate ri
sk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature.Standby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These
 guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financin
g, 184and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associate
d with these guarantees was $7 million and $4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Through the Company™s credit process, Huntington monitors the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. When it is
 probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, losses are recognized in the provision for credi
t losses. At 
December 31, 2015, Huntington had $512 million of standby letters-of-credit outstanding, of which 80% were collateralized. Included in this $512 million total are letters-of-credit issued by the Bank that support securities that were issued by customers and remarketed by The Huntington Investment Company, the Company™s broker-dealer subsidiary.
Huntington uses an internal grading system to assess an estimate of loss on its loan and lease portfolio. This same loan gradin
g system is used to monitor credit risk associated with standby letters-of-credit. Under this risk rating system as of December 31, 2015, approximately $186 million of the standby letters-of-credit were rated strong with sufficient asset quality, liquidity, and goo
d debt capacity and coverage, approximately $326 million were rated average with acceptable asset quality, liquidity, and modest debt 

capacity; and less than $1 million were rated substandard with negative financial trends, structural weaknesses, operating diff
iculties, and higher leverage.Commercial letters-of-credit represent short-term, self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than 90 days. The goods or cargo being traded normally secures these instruments.  As of
 December 31, 2015, Huntington had  $56 million of commercial letters-of-credit outstanding. Commitments to sell loansActivity related to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real est
ate loans of $659 million and $545 million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year.
LitigationThe nature of Huntington™s business ordinarily results in a certain amount of pending as well as threatened claims, litigation,
 investigations, regulatory and legal and administrative cases, matters and proceedings, all of which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. When the Company determines it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted, it vigorously defen
ds itself. The Company considers settlement of cases when, in management™s judgment, it is in the best interests of both the Compa
ny and its shareholders to do so.On at least a quarterly basis, Huntington assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with threatened and outstanding legal cases, matters and proceedings, utilizing the latest information available. For cases, matters and proceedings where it is both probable the Company will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, Huntington establishes an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any relevant developments. For cases, matters or proceedings where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established.In certain cases, matters and proceedings, exposure to loss exists in excess of the accrual to the extent such loss is reasonably possible, but not probable. Management believes an estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of 
amounts accrued, for current legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $80 million at December 31, 2015. For certain other cases, and matters, Management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss at this time. Any estimate involves significant judgment, 
given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the existence of multiple defendants in several of the current proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordin
gly, 
Management™s estimate will change from time-to-time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.
While the final outcome of legal cases, matters, and proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, Management believes that the amount it has already accrued is 
adequate and any incremental liability arising from the Company™s legal cases, matters, or proceedings will not have a material
 negative adverse effect on the Company™s consolidated financial position as a whole. However, in the event of unexpected future
 developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these cases, matters, and proceedings, if unfavorable, may be material to the Company™s consolidated financial position in a particular period.
Cyberco Litigation.  
The Bank has been named a defendant in two lawsuits, arising from the Bank™s commercial lending, 
depository, and equipment leasing relationships with Cyberco Holdings, Inc. (Cyberco), based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 

November 2004, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service raided Cyberco™s facilities and Cyberco™s 

operations ceased. An equipment leasing fraud was uncovered, whereby Cyberco sought financing from equipment lessors and 

financial institutions, including the Bank, allegedly to purchase computer equipment from Teleservices Group, Inc. (Teleservice
s). 185Cyberco created fraudulent documentation to close the financing transactions when, in fact, no computer equipment was ever purchased or leased from Teleservices, which later proved to be a shell corporation.
Cyberco filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on December 9, 2004, and a state court receiver for Teleservices then filed a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition for Teleservices on January 21, 2005. In an adversary proceeding commenced against the Bank on 

December 8, 2006, the Cyberco bankruptcy trustee sought recovery of over $70 million he alleged was transferred to the Bank. Th
e Cyberco bankruptcy trustee also alleged preferential transfers were made to the Bank in the amount of approximately $1 million.
 The 
Bank moved to dismiss the complaint and all but the preference claims were dismissed on January 29, 2008. The Bankruptcy Court 

ordered the case to be tried in July 2012, and entered an order governing all pretrial conduct. The Bank filed a motion for sum
mary judgment on the basis that the Cyberco trustee sought recovery of the same alleged transfers as the Teleservices trustee in a s
eparate case described below. The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion in principal part and the parties stipulated to a full dismissal 
which was entered on June 19, 2012.The Teleservices bankruptcy trustee filed a separate adversary proceeding against the Bank on January 19, 2007, seeking to 
avoid and recover alleged transfers that occurred in two ways: (1) checks made payable to the Bank for application to Cyberco™s
 indebtedness to the Bank, and (2) deposits into Cyberco™s bank accounts with the Bank. A trial was held as to only the Bank™s 

defenses. Subsequently, the trustee filed a summary judgment motion on the affirmative case, alleging the fraudulent transfers 
to the Bank totaled approximately $73 million and seeking judgment in that amount (which includes the $1 million alleged to be preferential transfers by the Cyberco bankruptcy trustee). On March 17, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Opinion determining that the 

alleged transfers made to the Bank during the period from April 30, 2004 through November 2004 were not received in good faith 
and that the Bank failed to show a lack of knowledge of the avoidability of the alleged transfers made from September 2003 through 
November 2004. The trustee then filed an amended motion for summary judgment in the affirmative case and a hearing was held on 

July 1, 2011.
On March 30, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued an Opinion on the Teleservices trustee™s motion determining the Bank was the 
initial transferee of the checks made payable to it and was a subsequent transferee of all deposits into Cyberco™s accounts. Th
e Bankruptcy Court ruled Cyberco™s deposits were themselves transfers to the Bank under the Bankruptcy Code, and the Bank was 

liable for both the checks and the deposits, totaling approximately $73 million. The Bankruptcy Court delivered its report and 

recommendation to the District Court for the Western District of Michigan, recommending that the District Court enter a final 

judgment against the Bank in the principal amount of $72 million, plus interest through July 27, 2012, in the amount of $9 million. The parties filed their respective objections and responses to the Bankruptcy Court™s report and recommendation. The District C
ourt held a hearing in September 2014 and conducted a de novo review of the fact findings and legal conclusions in the Bankruptcy Court™s 
report and recommendation.On September 28, 2015, the District Court entered a judgment against the Bank in the amount of $72 million plus costs and pre- and post-judgment interest. While Huntington has appealed the decision and plans to continue to aggressively contest the claims
 of this complex case, Huntington increased its legal reserves by approximately $38 million in the 2015 third quarter to fully accrue for the amount of the judgment.MERSCORP Litigation.  
The Bank is a defendant in an action filed on January 17, 2012 against MERSCORP, Inc. and 
numerous other financial institutions that participate in the mortgage electronic registration system (MERS). The putative clas
s action was filed on behalf of all 88 counties in Ohio. The plaintiffs allege that the recording of mortgages and assignments thereof i
s mandatory under Ohio law and seek a declaratory judgment that the defendants are required to record every mortgage and assignment on real property located in Ohio and pay the attendant statutory recording fees. The complaint also seeks damages, attorney™s f
ees and costs. Huntington filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which has been fully briefed, but no ruling has been issued by the Geauga County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas. Similar litigation has been initiated against MERSCORP, Inc. and other financial institutio
ns in other jurisdictions throughout the country, however, the Bank has not been named a defendant in those other cases.
Powell v. Huntington National Bank.  
The Bank is a defendant in a putative class action filed on October 15, 2013. The plaintiffs 
filed the action in West Virginia state court on behalf of themselves and other West Virginia mortgage loan borrowers who alleg
e they were charged late fees in violation of West Virginia law and the loan documents. Plaintiffs seek statutory civil penalties, com
pensatory damages and attorney™s fees. The Bank removed the case to federal court, answered the complaint, and, on January 17, 2014, file
d a motion for judgment on the pleadings, asserting that West Virginia law is preempted by federal law and therefore does not apply
 to the Bank. Following further briefing by the parties, the federal district court denied the Bank™s motion for judgment on the pleadi
ngs on September 26, 2014. On June 8, 2015, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Bank™s motion for an interlocutory appeal 
of the district court™s decision.  
The matter was briefed and oral argument held, but after the oral argument, the Fourth Circuit 
dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings.Commitments Under Operating Lease Obligations
186At December 31, 2015, Huntington and its subsidiaries were obligated under noncancelable leases for land, buildings, and equipment. Many of these leases contain renewal options and certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property during or at the expiration of the lease period at specified prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other operating expenses or proportionately adjusted for increases in the consumer or other price indices.The future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2015, were as follows: $53 million in 2016, $49 million in 2017, $46 million in 2018, $42 million in 2019, $41 million in 2020, and $191 million thereafter. At December 31, 2015, total minimum lease payments have not 

been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $11 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. At December 31, 2015, 
the future minimum sublease rental payments that Huntington expects to receive were as follows: $4 million in 2016, $2 million in 2
017, $2 million in 2018, $1 million in 2019, $1 million in 2020, and $1 million thereafter. The rental expense for all operating lea
ses was $58 million, $57 million, and $55 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Huntington had no material obligations under 
capital leases.21. OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
Huntington and its bank subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank (the Bank), are subject to various regulatory capital 
requirements administered banking regulators. These requirements involve qualitative judgments and quantitative measures of ass
ets, liabilities, capital amounts, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure 
to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effe
ct on Huntington™s and the Bank™s financial statements.
 Beginning in the 2015 first quarter, we became subject to the Basel III capital requirements including the standardized approa
ch for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. The Basel III capital requirements
 emphasize CET1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital, and implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders™ equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangi
bles net of related taxes, and DTAs that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1
 capital, perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments (TRUPS) that are subject to phase-out from tier 1 capital. Tier 2 
capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying ALLL.  We are also subject to CCAR and must submit annua
l capital plans to our banking regulators.  We may pay dividends and repurchase stock up to the levels submitted in our capital p
lan to which the FRB did not object. As of December 31, 2015, Huntington and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements and had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well-capitalized institutions.  The period-end capital amounts and capital ratios of Hunti
ngton and the Bank are as follows, including the CET1 ratio on a Basel III basis. The implementation of the Basel III capital requirement
s is transitional and phases-in from January 1, 2015 through the end of 2018.  Amounts presented prior to January 1, 2015 are calcul
ated using the Basel I capital requirements.Well-December 31,

Huntington has the ability to provide additional capital to the Bank to maintain the Bank™s risk-based capital ratios at levels
 at which would be considered well-capitalized.Huntington and its subsidiaries are also subject to various regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, debt, and dividends. The Bank is required to maintain cash reserves based on the level of certain of its deposits. This reserve requireme
nt may 187be met by holding cash in banking offices or on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank. During 2015 and 2014, the average balances
 of these deposits were $0.5 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is limited as to the amount and type of loans it may make to the parent company and nonbank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, the Bank could lend $678 million to a single affiliate, subject to the 

qualifying collateral requirements defined in the regulations.Dividends from the Bank are one of the major sources of funds for the Company. These funds aid the Company in the payment 
of dividends to shareholders, expenses, and other obligations. Payment of dividends to the parent company is subject to various legal and regulatory limitations. During 2015, the Bank paid dividends of $822 million to the holding company. Also, there are statut
ory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount availa
ble for dividend payments to the parent company by Huntington National Bank without prior regulatory approval was approximately $179 

million at December 31, 2015. 22. PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

23. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
MACQUARIE EQUIPMENT FINANCE
On March 31, 2015, Huntington completed its acquisition of Macquarie, subsequently rebranded Huntington Technology 
Finance, in a cash transaction valued at $458 million. The acquisition gives us the ability to drive added growth to our nation
al equipment finance business as well as additional small business finance capabilities.   As a result of the acquisition, Huntington recorded approximately $1.1 billion of assets and assumed $617 million of debt, securitizations, and other liabilities. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value in accordance with 
ASC 805, ﬁBusiness Combinationsﬂ. The fair values for assets were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates cur
rently being offered for leases with similar terms (Level 3). This value was reduced by an estimate of probable losses and the credit 
risk associated with leased assets. The fair values of debt, securitizations, and other liabilities were estimated by discounting ca
sh flows using interest rates currently being offered with similar maturities (Level 3). As part of the acquisition, Huntington recorded
 $156 million of goodwill, all of which is deductible for tax purposes.Pro forma results have not been disclosed, as those amounts are not significant to the audited consolidated financial statements.19024. SEGMENT REPORTING
Our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance.  We have five major business segments: Retail and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Automobile Finance 

and Commercial Real Estate (AFCRE), Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group (RBHPCG), and Home Lending. 

The Treasury / Other function includes our technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expen
se. Business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure an
d, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial instituti
ons. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the
 segments would perform if they operated as independent entitiesRevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.The management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to produc
t origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated 
to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five busi
ness segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported 

Significant Items, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the five business segments.We use an active and centralized Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business 
segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched 

duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of inte
rest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (c
redits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on 

prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).Retail and Business Banking - The Retail and Business Banking segment provides a wide array of financial products and 
services to consumer and small business customers including but not limited to checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, consumer loans, and small business loans. Other financial services available to consumer and small business customers include investments, insurance, interest rate risk protection, foreign exchange, and treasury management. Business Banking is defined as serving companies with revenues up to $20 million and consists of approximately 165,000 businessesCommercial Banking
 -  Through a relationship banking model, this segment provides a wide array of products and services to 
the middle market, large corporate, and government public sector customers located primarily within our geographic footprint. T
he segment is divided into seven business units: middle market, large corporate, specialty banking, asset finance, capital markets
, treasury management, and insurance.Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate
 - : This segment provides lending and other banking products and services 
to customers outside of our traditional retail and commercial banking segments. Our products and services include providing financing for the purchase of vehicles by customers at franchised automotive dealerships, financing the acquisition of new and used vehicle inventory of franchised automotive dealerships, and financing for land, buildings, and other commercial real estate owned or 
constructed by real estate developers, automobile dealerships, or other customers with real estate project financing needs. Products and services are delivered through highly specialized relationship-focused bankers and product partners. Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group
 - Regional Banking and The Huntington Private Client Group 
is closely aligned with our eleven regional banking markets.  The Huntington Private Client Group is organized into units consi
sting of The Huntington Private Bank, The Huntington Trust, and The Huntington Investment Company.  Our private banking, trust, and 

investment functions focus their efforts in our Midwest footprint and Florida.
Huntington sold Huntington Asset Advisors, Huntington Asset Services and Unified Financial Securities in the 2015 fourth 
quarter.
Home Lending -  Home Lending originates and services consumer loans and mortgages for customers who are generally located in our primary banking markets. Consumer and mortgage lending products are primarily distributed through the Retail and Business Banking segment, as well as through commissioned loan originators. Home lending earns interest on loans held in the 
warehouse and portfolio, earns fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage loans, and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. Home Lending supports the origination and servicing of mortgage loans across all segments.Listed below is certain financial information reconciled to Huntington™s December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, and
