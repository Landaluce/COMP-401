Our Purpose 
Sets Our Path
Linton Allen, founder of SunBank, one of SunTrust™s predecessor banks, 
subscribed to the following philosophy: 
If you build your community, you build your bank.
 For him, the purpose of a ˜nancial institution was as much about service as 

it was about the bottom line. He believed that those working in the banking 

industry have an obligation to leave behind a positive and lasting legacy for 

their communities. Today, Allen™s values continue to motivate and guide us.

A Message To 
Our Shareholders from William H. Rogers, Jr.
 Chairman and Chief Executive Of˜cer
 SunTrust Banks, Inc.
As a company, we are committed to 
Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being
. This commitment allowed 
us to deliver strong results for our clients, communities, teammates and shareholders in 2014. We made 

meaningful progress on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses 

and further improvement in credit quality. This successful execution helped SunTrust overcome the industry 

headwinds of reduced mortgage activity and the ongoing impact of the prolonged low-rate environment 

on net interest income. 

 
The result:
 18% adjusted earnings growth and a signi˜cantly improved ef˜ciency ratio. Our 
 
shareholders were rewarded by this performance with total shareholder return of 16% in 2014. 
Going forward, we will continue to keep our purpose of 
Lighting 
 the Way to Financial Well-Being
 at the center of everything we do. 
 It is a promise we make to our clients, our communities and our 
 teammates; and when we do this well, our business expands and 
our shareholders are rewarded.34Our Accomplishments2014 Financial Highlights
For the year 2014, SunTrust reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, or $3.23 per share. 
Excluding certain non-core items in both 2013 and 2014, adjusted earnings per share were $2.74 and $3.24, respectively, 
representing 18% growth year over year. Adjusted return on average assets improved 10 basis points to 0.98%, while adjusted 

return on average tangible common equity increased 85 basis points to 11.4%.
Our earnings growth and improved returns were driven by a signi˜cant reduction in expenses and further asset quality 
improvement. Total revenue, excluding the gain on sale of RidgeWorth Capital Management, was relatively stable compared 

to the prior year, as the impact of a lower net interest margin and the decline in mortgage origination activity was more than 

offset by solid loan and deposit growth, additional momentum in our wealth management and investment banking businesses, 

and higher mortgage servicing income.  
Adjusted expenses declined by approximately $200 million, as we right-sized our mortgage business and cyclical costs were 
reduced. However, a portion of these savings was reinvested in key growth areas, which we believe will drive sustainable 

pro˜tability over the long term.
Accordingly, we achieved an adjusted tangible ef˜ciency ratio of 63% for the year, well ahead of the target we set at the 
beginning of 2014 and approximately 200 basis points better than our 2013 performance. We have made considerable progress 

toward our long-term tangible ef˜ciency ratio target of sub-60%, and we remain ˜rmly focused on that commitment. Achieving 

this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to you, our shareholders.
Average performing loans grew 7%, led by continued momentum in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and 
direct consumer loans. Average client deposits grew 4%, with a favorable mix shift to lower-cost deposit products continuing.    
Credit quality continued to improve, as nonperforming loans declined 35% to 0.48% of loans and net charge-offs declined 34% 
to 0.34% of average loans. These improvements, in conjunction with sustained high-quality loan production, contributed 

to the $211 million reduction in the provision for credit losses. This performance is the result of improving economic conditions, 

in addition to the signi˜cant actions we have taken over the past several years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the 

quality of our loan production. Acknowledging our substantially improved asset quality and increased pro˜tability, Standard 

and Poor™s upgraded the senior long-term credit rating of our primary operating subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, to ﬁA-ﬂ from ﬁBBB+ﬂ 

in the fourth quarter.
We continued to maintain strong capital levels, with a Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.7%, relatively stable compared 
to the prior year. We did this while also growing total assets by 9% to support further client business. In addition, tangible book 

value per share increased 10% relative to the prior year. We repurchased $458 million of common stock in 2014, and we 

doubled our total annual common stock dividend from $0.35 per share in 2013 to $0.70 per share in 2014. The cumulative 

actions we have taken to improve our risk and earnings pro˜le, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help 

us further increase capital return to shareholders.  
Aside from a solid ˜nancial performance, 2014 also marked a meaningful step forward with regard to the resolution of certain 
legacy mortgage matters, which will allow us to more ˜rmly focus on meeting more of our clients™ needs while driving more 

consistent pro˜tability.

Report on Form 10-K.
2   Total revenue is comprised of net interest income presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis and noninterest income. The net interest margin and ef˜ciency ratios are presented 

on a FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement 

of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
56The Way Forward
Our clients™ con˜dence continues to improve, and we are focused on helping them capitalize on the improving 
 economy. We have the scale to compete with the largest banks, but are also small enough to remain nimble and to 
respond effectively to changing market conditions and consumer preferences.
The U.S. economy continues to be on a positive track. While slowing global growth and the steep decline in oil 
prices create uncertainty, continued job gains and improving housing prices, combined with the potential net 
bene˜t to consumers from lower oil prices, should help keep the U.S. economy on a path of further improvement.
We have a strong market position and continue to execute on our strategic priorities: 
1. Deepen Client Relationships
Our clients are at the center of everything we do, and we continue 
to enhance our products and capabilities to better meet their needs.
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we have added nearly 200 Premier Bankers over the past two years 
to help serve the wealth and investment advisory needs of our branch-based clients. For our high net worth and mass af˚uent 

clients, we introduced SunTrust SummitView
®, a ˜nancial planning and account aggregation tool that helps clients obtain a full 
picture of their ˜nances, resulting in more con˜dence and control. In addition, SummitView allows our advisors to have a 

complete view of a client™s ˜nancial standing, which enables them to provide even more relevant advice. For all of our clients, 

we have enhanced our digital capabilities Œ including improved mobile and tablet apps, an accessible and content-rich Resource 

Center on suntrust.com, and the offering of Apple PayŽ. Our continued innovation in this space earned us multiple Digital 

Banking Experience Leader awards from Javelin Strategy & Research. 
In Wholesale Banking, the investments we have been making in our Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) platform, 
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, continue to yield positive returns, as 2014 marked the seventh consecutive record year of 

investment banking income. We are applying our expertise from CIB to our Commercial Real Estate and Commercial and 

Business Banking clients to help them access the capital markets, expand their businesses and explore M&A opportunities. 

We believe our success is rooted in our differentiated business model Œ our One Team approach encourages teammates to

work collaboratively to meet clients™ needs across the platform.
Given the changes to the mortgage industry, our primary goal in Mortgage Banking has been to right-size our infrastructure; 
however, as has been the case across the company, we have also been focused on meeting more clients™ needs. Mortgages 

are a key product offering for our private wealth clients, and the business as a whole serves as an entry point to the rest of the 

company for many new clients. As an example, the percentage of our mortgage clients that have at least one other product 

has increased from 26% to 31% over the past year. 
Deepening client relationships requires coordination across the company and a client-˜rst approach. When we succeed, we take one 
step further in 
Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being
 for our clients.
1  Deepen Client 
Relationships
Enhance Returns by Optimizing 

Balance Sheet and Business Mix2  Improve 

Ef˜ciency3  2. Enhance Returns by Optimizing Balance Sheet and Business Mix
Over the past several years we have been focused on diversifying our balance sheet and reducing our 
concentration of residential real estate loans. This component of the strategy is largely complete, as 
residential-related loans have declined from 50% of our portfolio in 2007 to 29% at the end of 2014. 

We grew our commercial and consumer loan exposure over the same time frame, and in 2014 average 

performing commercial and consumer loans grew 14% and 8%, respectively. 
Going forward, the balance sheet optimization strategy will focus on enhancing returns more so than 
materially changing the business mix. Our balance sheet is an important resource, and we need to ensure 

that we use it effectively. We evaluate our returns on capital in the context of the entire client relationship, 

which includes deposits and fee income in addition to lending, and when we are unable to meet our 

internal hurdles, we explore balance sheet management alternatives. Accordingly, we sold over $4 billion 

of lower-return loans in 2014. 
Our progress on this strategic initiative has resulted in a much more diversi˜ed company, with better growth 
opportunities and improved access to new markets and clients. Additionally, the enhanced diversity of our 

balance sheet should aid in reducing the volatility of our ˜nancial performance in the future.
3. Improve Ef˜ciency
Streamlining the way we do business not only allows us to increase 
profitability, but also improves the effectiveness of how we serve our 
clients and our communities.Since setting our long-term tangible ef˜ciency ratio 
target of sub-60%, we have made signi˜cant 

progress Œ improving this ratio on an 

adjusted basis from 72% in 2011 to 
 
63% in 2014. To date, the entire 

improvement has been driven 

by rigorous expense discipline, 

evidenced by the 16% reduction 

in our adjusted expense base 

since 2011. In 2014, our expense 

reduction efforts were focused on 

right-sizing our mortgage business, 

optimizing our delivery model and 

streamlining our operations.
In Mortgage Banking, we exceeded 
our initial $200 million savings goal by 

acting decisively against the backdrop of 
 a lower origination environment. Additionally, 

we continued to proactively reduce our 
 
nonperforming loans and delinquent servicing 
 
portfolio balances. We also streamlined our go-to-market 

model by consolidating our retail and consumer direct channels 
 
and discontinuing our broker channel.
78Our clients have increasingly adopted digital applications as their primary means of conducting their banking activities, and we 
have reallocated resources to support increasing investments in these channels. Branches continue to play an important role in 

fostering relationships with new clients and addressing existing clients™ more complex needs, while self-service channels such 

as ATMs and digital products are playing a more predominant role in meeting everyday needs. As such, we reduced our branch 

count by 3% in 2014 while growing our digital investments, and going forward, we will continue to evolve our delivery network to 

service changing client needs and preferences.
Lastly, we have begun streamlining our operations and support-related infrastructure. For example, we consolidated 64 
decentralized mortgage processing locations into ˜ve end-to-end campuses. Additionally, we have continued to increase 

utilization of technology in certain areas, such as encouraging the usage of e-statements and using scanners to process 

checks more ef˜ciently in our branches.
Importantly, while streamlining our organization, we have not 
lost focus on the bigger picture: ef˜ciency improvements are 

derived from both expense discipline and revenue growth. 

Despite the challenging industry environment, we 

have taken a measured approach to expense 

reduction, being mindful of the continuing need 

to make important investments for long-term 

prosperity. In 2014, we hired new talent across 

each of our businesses to help further expand 

our revenue opportunities. As previously

noted, we also increased our investments 
 
in digital channels so our clients can 

conduct their banking when, where and 
how they choose. In addition, we continued 

to invest in our risk management and 

compliance infrastructure to ensure that 

we are meeting and exceeding increasing 

regulatory requirements.Going forward, revenue growth will become an 
increasingly important component of lowering our 

ef˜ciency ratio, as we have already taken steps to 

meaningfully reduce our cost base. We are continuing to 

invest in key growth priorities to drive increased revenue, 

which we expect will lead to improved ˜nancial performance 

over the long term. 
2014 Annual Report
None of our progress would be possible without the support and dedication of our teammates. 
I thank our SunTrust teammates for their continued service to our clients and communities, as well as 

their contributions to our company. I also thank our clients, who entrust us to help Light the Way to their 

Financial Well-Being and you, our shareholders, for your investment and continued support.
Lastly, I express my gratitude to our Board of Directors for their knowledge and guidance and welcome our 
newest Director, Paul R. Garcia, who joined us in July. Paul brings with him intimate knowledge of the payments 

and ˜nancial technology industries, both areas of important evolution for the ˜nancial services industry and for 

our clients.As we look ahead to the coming year, we will remain focused on the strategic priorities that have driven 
our success over the past few years Œ deeper client relationships, balance sheet optimization and 

ef˜ciency improvement. 
As one of the largest banks in our markets and an active corporate citizen in the communities we serve, we are 
keenly aware of our role in the continued economic recovery. We remain committed to delivering on those 

responsibilities for our clients, communities and teammates, and ultimately you,
 our shareholders.

 Association Hall of Honor for our commitment to service members and veterans who suffered injuries during 
active duty. Partnering with the Military Warriors Support Foundation, SunTrust teammates completed
 
renovations and home improvements on donated bank-owned residential homes and provided ˜nancial 
 
counseling to service members and families to help support them in achieving sustainable home ownership.
  
We are signi˜cantly enhancing our origination and ful˜llment process with industry-leading technology that 
 
will facilitate a faster and more transparent loan process for our clients.
11Helping Our 
Communities Shine
Through these efforts, we helped fellow community members 
obtain health care, ˜nd jobs, access resources to improve their 

˜nancial well-being and more.
SunTrust Foundation
 SunTrust™s philanthropy is designed to make a positive and 

lasting impact year after year. The SunTrust Foundation, 

the cornerstone of SunTrust™s giving efforts, donated $12 

million in 2014 to support 1,500 various community organi
-
zations, including educational institutions, local 

United Way chapters, Operation HOPE, 

Junior Achievement and the 

American Red Cross. 
SunTrust has always believed in forging strong community 

partnerships and building its reputation on relationships. We 

pride ourselves on our capabilities and our warmth Œ offering 

the resources of a large ˜nancial institution with the personal 
touch of a neighborhood branch.
Financial Well-Being can be an ongoing source of con˜dence 
and security Œ key factors in building strong and vibrant 

communities. SunTrust is proud to partner with our neighbors 

and friends in providing assistance and opportunities for 

those who need it most.Teammate Dedication
Throughout our organization, our teammates are passionate 

about giving back. Each year, teammates are offered eight 

paid hours of volunteer time. From teaching ˜nancial 

education at Junior Achievement, to building homes with 

Habitat for Humanity, to raising money for United Way, 

SunTrust teammates have demonstrated their commitment 

to community over and over again.

12             Supporting Economic Growth
 We also provide day-to-day support to members of our community through our lines 
 of business, ensuring a strong foundation that everyone can continue to build upon.
    In 2014, we originated and purchased $13.2 billion in mortgages to   
       help approximately 58,000 clients purchase, re˜nance or improve their   
     homes. Of these, 45% were low- or moderate-income borrowers or   
       homes in low- or moderate-income communities. 
    We also provided $2.4 billion in loans and investments    
        supporting affordable housing, economic development    
       and job growth, community services and the revitalization
       and stabilization of targeted areas in our communities.
    SunTrust funded more than $253 million in 
       Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) loans,    
       positioning us as one of the top 15 SBA lenders  
       nationwide.     We promoted additional opportunities community-
        wide by providing $1.9 billion in small business 
        and non-pro˜t loans with a community        development purpose.

ear is the SunTrust Financial Fitness  
   Program for Teammates, an online education   
    program that helps teammates and their 
families set and achieve ˜nancial 
goals. More than 12,000 have 
 enrolled in the program, 
and the reactions from 
 teammates have been 
overwhelmingly positive.
 Our purpose as an organization is to Light the Way to Financial 

Well-Being
, and we believe that begins with our own teammates. 

We are leveraging our resources as a ˜nancial institution to 

help our teammates become more con˜dent and in control 
 
of their own ˜nances Œ and have great days at work. 
These are just a few examples of how we are helping our 
teammates achieve their full potential, both personally 
 
and professionally:  
Enhancing Financial Well-Being
   For the third year in a row, our 
 
ﬁDay of Purposeﬂ provided
 
teammates an extra day off to
 
spend improving their own  
˜nancial well-being Œ by 
 organizing their ˜nances, establishing a budget, updating 
 
wills or attending to any other
 
personal ˜nancial matters. 
       Having the day off gave me 
the opportunity to go and meet with my insurance agent and 
reevaluate my family™s plan in case 

something happened to me or my husband... 

I really appreciated SunTrust giving me an 
extra day off to help my husband and [me]
increase our coverage and to have that 

peace of mind.ﬂ ŒAnna, teammate participating in  ﬁDay of Purposeﬂ
Helping Our 
Teammates Shine
14     This is a much needed blessing in my life right now– [the Financial Fitness] 
program is going to help me tremendously. I just wanted you to know how much
 I appreciate that our company is doing this not just for me, but for so many 

people who need it. It makes me even prouder to be part of this amazing company.ﬂ

Supporting Physical Well-Being
On the health and wellness front, we launched tools to help our teammates compare the quality and cost 
of health services, promoted our three on-site health care clinics and rewarded teammates for taking health 

actions such as completing their annual physical.
Boosting Performance
2014 also marked the inaugural graduating class of the PATHways Professional Banking Operations and 
 
Leadership program. This 36-credit, customized certi˜cate program provides teammates with a deeper 
 
understanding of the banking industry and our company. Designed in partnership with a higher education 
 
institution known for excellence in online education, PATHways has been nationally recognized by training 
 
professionals. It is among the ˜rst of its kind within the industry and is appreciated by attendees for its career 

enhancement opportunities.Because of programs like these, our teammates reported their highest level of engagement in 2014 as 
measured by our annual survey. Meaningful increases were recorded in workplace satisfaction and greater 

con˜dence in the direction of our company. Our teammates drive our success, and as teammate engagement 

continues to rise, our clients, communities and shareholders will bene˜t.1516Board of DirectorsExecutive

Omni-channel Strategy
Over 
the 
last 
several 
years, 
the 
Company 
has 
significantly 
increased 
investments 
in 
technology 
and 
other 
capabilities 
to 
provide 
clients 
with 
increased 
functionality 
and 
self-service 
capabilities. 
This 
resulted 
in 
increased 
utilization 
of 
lower
-cost 
self-service 
channels, 
which 
has 
enabled 
us 
to 
reduce 
our 
branch 
count 
by 
3% 
in 
2014 
and 
13% 
since 
201
1. 
Going 
forward, 
we 
will 
continue 
to 
optimize 
our 
delivery 
network 
and 
the 
pace 
will 
be 
dependent 
upon 
client 
needs 
and 
preferences. 
W
e 
have 
also 
made 
investments 
in 
technology 
to 
grow 
revenues. 
Among 
these 
were 
the 
acquisition 
in 
2012 
of 
an 
on-line 
lending 
portal 
that 
became 
the 
foundation 
for 
our

acquisition 
of 
financial 
institutions 
and 
other 
business 
types 
eligible 
for

ownership

values

may 
submit 
bids 
for 
assets 
of 
such 
financial 
institutions

disposition 
of 
certain 
of 
its 
assets,

There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
obligations 
and 
restrictions 
imposed 
on 
bank 
holding 
companies 
and 
their 
depository 
institution 
subsidiaries 
by 
federal 
law 
and 
regulatory 
policy 
that 
are 
designed 
to 
reduce 
potential 
loss 
exposure 
to 
the 
depositors 
of 
such 
depository 
institutions 
and 
to 
the 
FDIC 
deposit 
insurance 
fund 
in 
the 
event 
the 
depository 
institution 
becomes 
in 
danger 
of 
default 
or 
is 
in 
default. 
For 
example, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act 
and 
Federal 
Reserve 
policy
, 
a 
bank 
holding 
company 
is 
required 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
source 
of 
financial 
strength 
to 
its 
subsidiary 
depository 
institutions 
and 
commit 
resources 
to 
support 
such 
institutions, 
which 
may 
include 
circumstances 
in 
which 
it 
might 
not 
otherwise 
do 
so.
The 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
are 
subject 
to 
an 
extensive 
regulatory 
framework 
of 
complex 
and 
comprehensive 
federal 
and 
state 
laws 
and 
regulations 
addressing 
the 
provision 
of 
banking 
and 
other 
financial 
services 
and 
other 
aspects 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
businesses 
and 
operations. 
Regulation 
and 
regulatory 
oversight 
have 
increased 
significantly 
over 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
primarily 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
in 
2010. 
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
imposes 
regulatory 
requirements 
and 
oversight 
over 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
institutions 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways, 
among 
which 
are 
(i)€creating 
the 
CFPB
 
to 
regulate 
consumer 
financial 
products 
and 
services; 
(ii)€creating 
the 
Financial 
Stability 
Oversight 
Council 
to 
identify 
and 
impose 
additional 
regulatory 
oversight 
on 
lar
ge 
financial 
firms; 
(iii)€granting 
orderly 
liquidation 
authority 
to 
the 
FDIC 
for 
the 
liquidation 
of 
financial 
corporations 
that 
pose 
a 
risk 
to 
the 
financial 
system 
of 
the 
U.S.; 
(iv) 
requiring 
financial 
institutions 
to 
draft 
a 
resolution 
plan 
that 
contemplates 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
enterprise 
and 
submit 
that 
resolution 
plan 
to 
both 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
the 
FDIC; 
(v)€limiting 
debit 
card 
interchange 
fees; 
(vi)€adopting 
certain 
changes 
to 
shareholder 
rights 
and 
responsibilities, 
including 
a 
shareholder 
ﬁsay 
on 
payﬂ 
vote 
on 
executive 
compensation; 
(vii)€strengthening 
the 
SEC's 
powers 
to 
regulate 
securities 
markets; 
(viii)€regulating 
OTC 
derivative 
markets; 
(ix)€restricting 
variable-rate 
lending 
by 
requiring 
the 
ability 
to 
repay 
to 
be 
determined 
for 
variable-rate 
loans 
by 
using 
the 
maximum 
rate 
that 
will 
apply 
during 
the 
first 
five 
years 
of 
a 
variable-rate 
loan 
term, 
and 
making 
more 
loans 
subject 
to 
provisions 
for 
higher 
cost 
loans, 
new 
disclosures, 
and 
certain 
other 
revisions; 
(x) 
changing 
the 
base 
upon 
which 
the 
deposit 
insurance 
assessment 
is 
assessed 
from 
deposits 
to, 
substantially
, 
average 
consolidated 
assets 
minus 
equity; 
and 
(xi)€amending 
the 
T
ruth 
in 
Lending 
Act 
with 
respect 
to 
mortgage 
originations, 
including 
originator 
compensation, 
minimum 
repayment 
standards, 
and 
prepayment 
considerations.
One 
of 
the 
more 
important 
changes 
instituted 
by 
the 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act 
is 
the 
requirement 
for 
twice-annual 
stress 
tests 
of 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
bank. 
The 
performance 
of 
the 
Company 
under 
the 
stress 
tests 
and 
the 
CCAR 
determine 
the 
capital 
actions 
the 
Company 
will 
be 
permitted 
by 
its 
regulators 
to 
take, 
such 
as 
dividends 
and 
share 
repurchases. 
Due 
to 
the 
importance 
and 
intensity 
of 
the 
stress 
tests 
and 
the 
CCAR 
process, 
the 
Company 
has 
dedicated 
significant 
resources 
to 
comply 
with 
stress 
testing 
and 
capital 
planning 
requirements. 
These 
changes 
have 
profoundly 
impacted 
our 
policies 
and 
procedures 
and 
will 
likely 
continue 
to 
do 
so 
as 
regulators 
adopt 
regulations 
going 
forward 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
timetable 
for 
enacting 
regulations 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act.
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
imposed 
a 
new 
regulatory 
regime 
for 
the 
OTC 
derivatives 
market, 
aimed 
at 
increasing 
transparency 
and 
reducing 
systemic 
risk 
in 
the 
derivative 
markets, 
such 
as 
requirements 
for 
central 
clearing, 
exchange 
trading, 
capital, 
mar
gin, 
reporting, 
and 
recordkeeping. 
Jurisdiction 
is 
broadly 
shared 
by 
the 
CFTC
 
for 
swaps 
and 
the 
SEC 
for 
security-based 
swaps. 
In 
2012 
and 
2013, 
the 
CFTC
 
finalized 
most 
of 
its 
core 
regulations, 
triggering 
a 
phased-in 
compliance 
period 
commencing 
in 
late 
2012 
and 
continuing 
throughout 
2013. 
The 
Bank 
provisionally 
registered 
as 
a 
swap 
dealer 
with 
the 
CFTC
 
and 
became 
subject 
to 
new 
substantive 
requirements, 
including 
trade 
reporting 
and 
robust 
record 
keeping 
requirements, 
business 
conduct 
requirements 
(including 
daily 
valuations, 
disclosure 
of 
material 
risks 
associated 
with 
swaps 
and 
disclosure 
of 
material 
incentives 
and 
conflicts 
of 
interest), 
and 
mandatory 
clearing 
of 
certain 
standardized 
swaps 
designated 
by 
the 
CFTC
, 
such 
as 
most 
interest 
rate 
swaps. 
The 
SEC 
has 
proposed 
most 
of 
its 
core 
regulations 
for 
security-based 
swaps 
but 
most 
of 
its 
new 
requirements 
await 
final 
regulations, 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
similar 
to 
the 
CFTC
 
rules 
for 
swaps. 
The 
Company's 
derivatives 
business 
is 
expected 
to 
become 
subject 
to 
additional 
substantive 
requirements, 
including 
mar
gin 
requirements 
in 
excess 
of 
current 
market 
practice, 
increased 
capital 
requirements 
and 
exchange 
trading 
requirements. 
These 
new 
rules 
collectively 
will 
impose 
implementation 
and 
ongoing 
compliance 
requirements 
for 
the 
Company 
and 
will 
introduce 
additional 
legal 
risk, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
newly 
applicable 
anti-fraud 
and 
anti-manipulation 
provisions 
and 
private 
rights 
of 
action.
Under 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
the 
FDIC 
has 
the 
authority 
to 
liquidate 
certain 
financial 
holding 
companies 
that 
are 
determined 
to 
pose 
significant 
risks 
to 
the 
financial 
stability 
of 
the 
U.S. 
(ﬁcovered 
financial 
companiesﬂ). 
Under 
this 
scenario, 
the 
FDIC 
would 
exercise 
broad 
powers 
to 
take 
prompt 
corrective 
action 
to 
resolve 
problems 
with 
a 
covered 
financial 
company
. 
The 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act 
gives 
the 
Financial 
Stability 
Oversight 
Council 
substantial 
resolution 
authority
, 
which 
may 
af
fect 
or 
alter 
the 
rights 
of 
creditors 
and 
investors 
in 
a 
resolution 
or 
distressed 
scenario. 
The 
FDIC 
may 
make 
risk-based 
assessments 
of 
all 
bank 
holding 
companies 
with 
total 
consolidated 
assets 
greater 
than 
$50 
billion 
to 
recover 
losses 
incurred 
by 
the 
FDIC 
in 
exercising 
its 
authority 
to 
liquidate 
covered 
financial 
companies. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
bank 
holding 
companies 
with 
total 
consolidated 
assets 
of 
$50 
billion 
or 
more 
are 
required 
to 
submit 
resolution 
plans 
to 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
FDIC 
providing 
for 
the 
company's 
strategy 
for 
rapid 
and 
orderly 
resolution 
in 
the 
event 
of 
its 
material 
financial 
distress 
or 
failure. 
In 
September 
201
1, 
these 
agencies 
issued 
a 
joint 
final 
resolution 
plan 
rule 
3
implementing 
this 
requirement. 
The 
FDIC 
issued 
a 
separate 
such 
rule 
applicable 
to 
insured 
depository 
institutions 
of 
$50 
billion 
or 
more 
in 
total 
assets. 
The 
Company 
and 
the 
Bank 
submitted 
their 
second 
resolution 
plans 
to 
these 
agencies 
in 
December 
2014. 
If 
a 
plan 
is 
not 
approved, 
the 
Company™
s 
and 
the 
Bank™
s 
growth, 
activities, 
and 
operations 
may 
be 
restricted.
Most 
recently
, 
federal 
regulators 
have 
finalized 
rules 
for 
new 
capital 
requirements 
for 
financial 
institutions 
that 
include 
several 
changes 
to 
the 
way 
capital 
is 
calculated 
and 
how 
assets 
are 
risk-
weighted, 
informed 
in 
part 
by 
the 
Basel 
Committee 
on 
Banking 
Supervision's 
Basel 
III 
revised 
international 
capital 
framework. 
The 
rules, 
summarized 
briefly 
below
, 
will 
have 
an 
ef
fect 
on 
the 
Company's 
level 
of 
capital, 
and 
may 
influence 
the 
types 
of 
business 
the 
Company 
may 
pursue 
and 
how 
the 
Company 
pursues 
business 
opportunities. 
Among 
other 
things, 
the 
final 
rules 
raise 
the 
required 
minimums 
for 
certain 
capital 
ratios, 
add 
a 
new 
common 
equity 
ratio, 
include 
capital 
buf
fers, 
and 
restrict 
what 
constitutes 
capital. 
The 
new 
capital 
and 
risk 
weighting 
requirements 
became 
ef
fective 
for 
the 
Company 
on 
January 
1, 
2015. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014, 
the 
Company 
provides 
an 
estimate 
of 
what 
CET
 
1
 
would 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
new 
capital 
and 
R
W
A
 
requirements 
based 
upon 
the 
Company's 
interpretation 
of 
the 
final 
rules.

Capital 
Framework 
and 
Basel 
III
On 
July 
9, 
2013, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve, 
jointly 
with 
other 
federal 
regulators, 
published 
three 
final 
rules, 
generally 
consistent 
with 
the 
three 
proposed 
rules 
published 
August 
30, 
2012, 
substantially 
implementing 
the 
Basel 
III 
accord 
for 
the 
U.S. 
banking 
system 
(the 
ﬁFinal 
Rulesﬂ). 
The 
Final 
Rules 
are 
ef
fective 
for 
the 
Company 
starting 
January 
1, 
2015, 
pursuant 
to 
a 
phase-in 
schedule. 
The 
Final 
Rules 
generally 
include, 
among 
others, 
the 
following 
requirements 
applicable 
to 
the 
Company:
Ł 
A
 
new 
minimum 
CET
 
1 
ratio 
of 
4.5%; 
a 
T

and 
ﬁAdditional 
T

instruments 
meeting 
specified 
requirements, 
of 
6.0%; 
and 
a

with 
a 
numerator 
consisting 
of 
the 
sum 
of 
CET

Additional 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
and 
T
ier 
2 
capital, 
of 
8.0%.
Ł 
CET
 
1 
is 
defined 
narrowly 
by 
requiring 
that 
most 
deductions 
or 
adjustments 
to 
regulatory 
capital 
measures 
be 
made 
to 
CET
 
1, 
and 
expanding 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
deductions 
or 
adjustments 
as 
compared 
to 
existing 
regulations.
Ł 
A
 
2.5% 
ﬁcapital

Capital 
ratios, 
ef
fectively 
resulting 
(upon 
full 
implementation 
on 
January 
1, 
2019) 
in 
minimum 
ratios 
of 
7.0%, 
8.5%, 
and 
10.5% 
for

and 
a 
minimum 
L

ratio 
in

with 
regulatory 
guidelines, 
which 
would 
apply
, 
subject 
to 
certain 
exceptions, 
to 
an 
array 
of 
CRE
 
loans.
Ł 
An 
increase 
in 
capital 
char
ges 
for 
of
f-balance

with 
an 
original

, 
and 
certain 
other 
of
f-balance

unfunded 
commitments.
Ł 
Inclusion 
of 
unrealized 
gains 
and 
losses 
in 
AOCI 
on 
all

AFS, 
defined 
benefit 
pension 
plans, 
and 
certain 
cash 
flow 
hedges 
in 
the 
calculation 
of 
CET
 
1, 
subject 
to 
a 
one-time 
election 
to 
retain 
the 
current 
treatment 
for 
these 
items.
The 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer 
is 
a 
buf
fer 
of 
common 
equity 
above 
the 
minimum 
levels 
and 
is 
designed 
to 
provide 
incentives 
for 
banking 
or
ganizations 
to 
hold 
suf
ficient 
capital 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
that 
their 
capital 
levels 
would 
fall 
below 
their 
minimum 
requirements 
during 
a 
period 
of 
financial 
stress. 
If 
a 
banking 
or
ganization 
does 
not 
preserve 
the 
buf
fer 
it 
will 
face 
constraints 
on 
capital 
distributions, 
share 
repurchases 
and 
other 
capital 
instrument 
redemptions, 
and 
discretionary 
bonus 
payments 
to 
executive 
of
ficers. 
The 
Company's 
and 
Bank's 
current 
capital 
levels 
already 
exceed 
these 
capital 
requirements, 
including 
the 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer
.

Liquidity 
Ratios 
under 
Basel 
III
Historically
, 
regulation 
and 
monitoring 
of 
bank 
and 
bank 
holding 
company 
liquidity 
has 
been 
addressed 
as 
a 
supervisory 
matter
, 
both 
in 
the 
U.S. 
and 
internationally
, 
without 
required 
formulaic 
measures. 
The 
Basel 
III 
framework 
dictates 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
companies 
measure 
their 
liquidity 
against 
specific 
liquidity 
ratios 
that, 
although 
similar 
in 
some 
respects 
to 
liquidity 
measures 
historically 
applied 
by 
banks 
and 
regulators 
for 
management 
and 
supervisory 
purposes, 
will 
be 
required 
by 
regulation 
going 
forward. 
One 
ratio, 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
LCR
, 
is 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
banking 
entity 
maintains 
high 
quality 
liquid 
assets 
suf
ficient 
to 
withstand 
projected 
cash 
outflows 
under 
a 
prescribed 
30-day 
liquidity 
stress 
scenario. 
The 
other 
ratio, 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
NSFR
, 
is 
designed 
to 
promote 
medium 
and 
long-term 
funding 
based 
on 
the 
liquidity 
characteristics 
of 
the 
assets 
and 
activities 
of 
banking 
entities 
over 
a 
one-year 
time 
horizon. 
U.S. 
banking 
or
ganizations 
subject 
to 
the 
modified 
LCR
 
will 
have 
until 
January 
1, 
2016 
to 
begin 
calculation 
under 
the 
final 
LCR 
rule 
and 
will 
be 
required 
to 
do 
so 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis. 
On 
October 
31, 
2014, 
the 
Basel 
Committee 
on 
Banking 
Supervision 
(
BCBS
) 
issued 
its 
final 
rules 
for 
the 
NSFR
. 
 
U.S. 
regulators 
are 
expected 
to 
release 
a 
notice 
of 
proposed 
rulemaking 
for 
the 
U.S. 
NSFR 
in 
2015.
Enhanced 
Prudential 
Standar
ds
As 
directed 
pursuant 
to 
Sections 
165 
and 
166 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
proposed 
a 
rule 
in 
201
1 
establishing 
heightened 
prudential 
standards 
applicable 
to 
BHC
s 
with 
assets 
over 
$50 
billion, 
including 
heightened 
standards 
for: 
(i) 
risk-
based 
capital 
requirements 
and 
leverage 
limits; 
(ii) 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
requirements; 
(iii) 
risk 
management 
requirements; 
(iv) 
stress 
tests; 
(v) 
single 
counterparty 
credit 
exposure 
limits; 
and 
(vi) 
remedial 
actions 
that 
must 
be 
taken, 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
financial 
distress 
(ﬁearly 
remediationﬂ). 
The 
capital 
stress 
testing 
rules 
were 
finalized 
in 
late 
2013. 
In 
February 
2014, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
adopted 
a 
final 
Enhanced 
Prudential 
Standards 
rule 
implementing 
the 
liquidity 
and 
risk 
management 
requirements 
in 
the 
201
1 
proposal, 
imposing 
greater 
supervision 
and 
oversight 
of 
liquidity 
and 
general 
risk 
management 
by 
boards 
of 
directors. 
The 
FRB 
has 
stated 
that 
the 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
requirements 
are 
in 
4
addition 
to, 
and 
intended 
to 
be 
complementary 
to, 
those 
imposed 
by 
the 
final 
LCR 
rule. 
The 
FRB 
has 
not 
yet 
adopted 
final 
rules 
regarding 
single 
counterparty 
exposure 
limits 
and 
early 
remediation. 
Other
 
Regulation
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
the 
FDIC 
have 
issued 
substantially 
similar 
risk-based 
and 
leverage 
capital 
guidelines 
applicable 
to 
U.S. 
banking 
or
ganizations. 
Additionally
, 
these 
regulatory 
agencies 
may 
require 
that 
a 
banking 
or
ganization 
maintain 
capital 
above 
the 
minimum 
levels, 
whether 
because 
of 
its 
financial 
condition 
or 
actual 
or 
anticipated 
growth. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
risk-based 
guidelines 
define 
a 
tier
-based 
capital 
framework. 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
includes 
common 
shareholders' 
equity
, 
trust 
preferred 
securities, 
certain 
non-controlling 
interests 
and 
qualifying 
preferred 
stock, 
less 
goodwill 
(net 
of 
any 
qualifying 
DTL
) 
and 
other 
adjustments. 
Beginning 
in 
2015, 
a 
phase 
out 
period 
will 
begin 
for 
trust 
preferred 
securities 
included 
in 
T
ier 
1, 
resulting 
in 
a 
complete 
phase-out 
of 
T
ier 
1 
by 
January 
1, 
2016. 
These 
trust 
preferred 
securities 
will 
become 
includable 
in 
T
ier 
2 
capital. 
T
ier 
2 
capital 
consists 
of 
preferred 
stock 
not 
qualifying 
as 
T
ier 
1 
capital, 
mandatorily 
convertible 
debt, 
limited 
amounts 
of 
subordinated 
debt, 
other 
qualifying 
term 
debt, 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
amount 
and 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
unrealized 
gain 
on 
equity 
securities. 
The 
sum 
of 
T
ier 
1 
and 
T
ier 
2 
capital 
represents 
the 
Company's 
qualifying 
total 
capital. 
Risk-
based 
capital 
ratios 
are 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
T
ier 
1 
and 
total 
capital 
by 
R
W
As. 
Assets 
and 
of
f-balance 
sheet 
exposures 
are 
assigned 
to 
one 
of 
four 
categories 
of 
risk-weights, 
based 
primarily 
on 
relative 
credit 
risk. 
Additionally
, 
the 
Company
, 
and 
any 
bank 
with 
significant 
trading 
activity
, 
must 
incorporate 
a 
measure 
for 
market 
risk 
in 
their 
regulatory 
capital 
calculations. 
The 
leverage 
ratio 
is 
determined 
by 
dividing 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
by 
adjusted 
average 
total 
assets. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
also 
requires 
the 
Company 
to 
calculate, 
report, 
and 
maintain 
certain 
levels 
of 
T
ier 
1 
common 
equity
. 
T
ier 
1 
common 
equity 
is 
calculated 
by 
taking 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
and 
subtracting 
certain 
elements, 
including 
perpetual 
preferred 
stock 
and 
related 
surplus, 
non-controlling 
interests 
in 
subsidiaries, 
trust 
preferred 
securities 
and 
mandatorily 
convertible 
preferred 
securities. 
Under 
the 
final 
Basel 
III
 
rules, 
as 
discussed 
above, 
the 
capital 
requirements 
for 
bank 
holding 
companies 
and 
banks 
will 
increase 
substantially
.
The 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
have 
broad 
powers 
with 
which 
to 
require 
companies 
to 
take 
prompt 
corrective 
action 
to 
resolve 
problems 
of 
insured 
depository 
institutions. 
The 
extent 
of 
these 
powers 
depends 
upon 
whether 
the 
institutions 
in 
question 
are 
ﬁwell 
capitalized,ﬂ 
ﬁadequately 
capitalized,ﬂ 
ﬁunder
-
capitalized,ﬂ 
ﬁsignificantly 
undercapitalizedﬂ 
or 
ﬁcritically 
undercapitalized,ﬂ 
as 
such 
terms 
are 
defined 
under 
regulations 
issued 
by 
each 
of 
the 
federal 
banking 
agencies, 
including 
progressively 
more 
restrictive 
constraints 
on 
operations, 
management, 
and 
capital 
distributions. 
Failure 
to 
meet 
the 
capital 
guidelines 
could 
also 
subject 
a 
banking 
institution 
to 
capital 
raising 
requirements. 
An 
ﬁundercapitalizedﬂ 
bank 
must 
develop 
a 
capital 
restoration 
plan 
and 
its 
parent 
holding 
company 
must 
guarantee 
that 
bank's 
compliance 
with 
the 
plan. 
The 
liability 
of 
the 
parent 
holding 
company 
under 
any 
such 
guarantee 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
lesser 
of 
5.0% 
of 
the 
bank's 
assets 
at 
the 
time 
it 
became 
ﬁundercapitalizedﬂ 
or 
the 
amount 
needed 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
plan. 
The 
final 
capital 
rules 
described 
above 
amended 
the 
prompt 
corrective 
action 
framework 
to 
include 
the 
new 
CET
 
1 
measure 
and 
higher 
minimum 
capital 
requirements, 
ef
fective 
January 
1, 
2015, 
such 
that 
the 
minimum 
CET
 
1, 
T
ier 
1 
risk-based, 
and 
total 
risk 
based 
measures 
required 
to 
be 
ﬁadequately 
capitalizedﬂ 
will 
be 
4.5%, 
6.0%, 
and 
8.0%, 
respectively
, 
ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ, 
will 
be 
at 
least 
2.0% 
higher 
in 
each 
respective 
category
, 
and 
the 
minimum 
standard 
leverage 
ratio 
to 
be 
adequately 
capitalized 
and 
well-capitalized 
will 
be 
4.0% 
and 
5.0%, 
respectively
. 
Furthermore, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
the 
bankruptcy 
of 
the 
parent 
holding 
company
, 
such 
guarantee 
would 
take 
priority 
over 
the 
parent's 
general 
unsecured 
creditors. 
Additionally
, 
FDICIA
 
requires 
the 
various 
regulatory 
agencies 
to 
prescribe 
certain 
non-capital 
standards 
for 
safety 
and 
soundness 
relating 
generally 
to 
operations 
and 
management, 
asset 
quality
, 
and 
executive 
compensation 
and 
permits 
regulatory 
action 
against 
a 
financial 
institution 
that 
does 
not 
meet 
such 
standards.
Regulators 
also 
must 
take 
into 
consideration: 
(i)€concentrations 
of 
credit 
risk; 
(ii)€interest 
rate 
risk 
(when 
the 
interest 
rate 
sensitivity 
of 
an 
institution's 
assets 
does 
not 
match 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
its 
liabilities 
or 
its 
of
f-balance 
sheet 
position); 
and 
(iii)€risks 
from 
non-traditional 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
institution's 
ability 
to 
manage 
those 
risks, 
when 
determining 
the 
adequacy 
of 
an 
institution's 
capital. 
Regulators 
make 
this 
evaluation 
as 
a 
part 
of 
their 
regular 
examination 
of 
the 
institution's 
safety 
and 
soundness. 
Additionally
, 
regulators 
may 
choose 
to 
examine 
other 
factors 
in 
order 
to 
evaluate 
the 
safety 
and 
soundness 
of 
financial 
institutions. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
announced 
that 
its 
approval 
of 
certain 
capital 
actions, 
such 
as 
dividend 
increases 
and 
stock 
repurchase, 
will 
be 
tied 
to 
the 
level 
of 
CET
 
1, 
and 
that 
bank 
holding 
companies 
must 
consult 
with 
the 
Federal 
Reserve's 
staf
f 
before 
taking 
any 
actions, 
such 
as 
stock 
repurchases, 
capital 
redemptions, 
or 
dividend 
increases, 
which 
might 
result 
in 
a 
diminished 
capital 
base.
In 
addition, 
there 
are 
various 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
limits 
on 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
Company's 
subsidiary 
bank 
may 
pay 
dividends 
or 
otherwise 
supply 
funds 
to 
the 
Company
. 
Federal 
and 
state 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
also 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
prevent 
a 
bank 
or 
BHC
 
from 
paying 
a 
dividend 
or 
engaging 
in 
any 
other 
activity 
that, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
agency
, 
would 
constitute 
an 
unsafe 
or 
unsound 
practice. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
the 
ﬁliquidation 
or 
other 
resolutionﬂ 
of 
an 
insured 
depository 
institution, 
the 
FDIA
 
provides 
that 
the 
claims 
of 
depositors 
of 
the 
institution 
(including 
the 
claims 
of 
the 
FDIC
 
as 
subrogee 
of 
insured 
depositors) 
and 
certain 
claims 
for 
administrative 
expenses 
of 
the 
FDIC
 
as 
a 
receiver 
will 
have 
priority 
over 
other 
general 
unsecured 
claims 
against 
the 
institution. 
If 
an 
insured 
depository 
institution 
fails, 
insured 
and 
uninsured 
depositors, 
along 
with 
the 
FDIC
, 
will 
have 
priority 
in 
payment 
ahead 
of 
unsecured, 
nondeposit 
creditors, 
including 
the 
parent 
BHC
, 
with 
respect 
to 
any 
extensions 
of 
credit 
they 
have 
made 
to 
such 
insured 
depository 
institution.
The 
standard 
deposit 
insurance 
amount 
provided 
by 
the 
FDIC
 
is 
$250,000 
per 
depositor
, 
per 
insured 
bank, 
per 
ownership 
category
. 
It 
provides 
this 
insurance 
through 
the 
DIF
, 
which 
the 
FDIC
 
maintains 
by 
assessing 
depository 
institutions 
an 
insurance 
premium. 
The 
FDIC
 
assesses 
deposit 
insurance 
premiums 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
depository 
institution's 
average 
consolidated 
net 
assets 
using 
a 
premium 
rate 
that 
includes 
a 
variety 
of 
factors 
that 
translate 
into 
a 
complex 
scorecard.
5
FDIC
 
regulations 
require 
that 
management 
report 
annually 
on 
its 
responsibility 
for 
preparing 
its 
institution's 
financial 
statements, 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
an 
internal 
control 
structure 
and 
procedures 
for 
financial 
reporting, 
and 
compliance 
with 
designated 
laws 
and 
regulations 
concerning 
safety 
and 
soundness.
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
created 
the 
CFPB
, 
which 
is 
separated 
into 
five 
units: 
Research, 
Community 
Af
fairs, 
Complaint 
T
racking 
and 
Collection, 
Of
fice 
of 
Fair 
Lending 
and 
Equal 
Opportunity
, 
and 
Of
fice 
of 
Financial 
Literacy
. 
The 
CFPB
 
has 
broad 
power 
to 
adopt 
new 
regulations 
to 
protect 
consumers, 
which 
power 
it 
may 
exercise 
at 
its 
discretion 
and 
so 
long 
as 
it 
advances 
the 
general 
concept 
of 
the 
protection 
of 
consumers. 
In 
particular
, 
such 
regulations 
may 
further 
restrict 
the 
Company's 
banking 
subsidiary 
from 
collecting 
overdraft 
fees 
or 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
overdraft 
fees 
that 
may 
be 
collected 
by 
the 
Company's 
banking 
subsidiary 
beyond 
the 
limits 
imposed 
by 
the 
2009 
amendments 
to 
Regulation 
E 
discussed 
below
.
Federal 
banking 
regulators, 
as 
required 
under 
the 
GLB 
Act
, 
have 
adopted 
rules 
limiting 
the 
ability 
of 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
institutions 
to 
disclose 
nonpublic 
information 
about 
consumers 
to 
nonaf
filiated 
third 
parties. 
The 
rules 
require 
disclosure 
of 
privacy 
policies 
to 
consumers 
and, 
in 
some 
circumstances, 
allow 
consumers 
to 
prevent 
disclosure 
of 
certain 
personal 
information 
to 
nonaf
filiated 
third 
parties. 
The 
privacy 
provisions 
of 
the 
GLB 
Act
 
af
fect 
how 
consumer 
information 
is 
transmitted 
through 
diversified 
financial 
services 
companies 
and 
conveyed 
to 
outside 
vendors.
There 
are 
limits 
and 
restrictions 
on 
transactions 
in 
which 
the 
Bank 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
may 
engage 
with 
the 
Company 
and 
other 
Company 
subsidiaries. 
Sections 
23A
 
and 
23B 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Act 
and 
the 
Federal 
Reserve's 
Regulation 
W
, 
among 
other 
things, 
govern 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
and 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
extensions 
of 
credit 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
to 
the 
Company 
and 
other 
Company 
subsidiaries, 
purchases 
of 
assets 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
from 
the 
Company 
and 
other 
Company 
subsidiaries, 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
collateral 
required 
to 
secure 
extensions 
of 
credit 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
to 
the 
Company 
and 
other 
Company 
subsidiaries. 
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
significantly 
enhanced 
and 
expanded 
the 
scope 
and 
coverage 
of 
the 
limitations 
imposed 
by 
Sections 
23A
 
and 
23B, 
in 
particular
, 
by 
including 
within 
its 
scope 
derivative 
transactions 
by 
and 
between 
the 
Bank 
or 
its 
subsidiaries 
and 
the 
Company 
or 
other 
Company 
subsidiaries. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
enforces 
the 
terms 
of 
23A
 
and 
23B 
and 
audits 
the 
enterprise 
for 
compliance.
In 
October 
201
1, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
other 
regulators 
jointly 
issued 
a 
proposed 
rule 
implementing 
requirements 
of 
a 
new 
Section 
13 
to 
the 
BHC 
Act
, 
commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
ﬁV
olcker 
Rule.ﬂ 
The 
regulatory 
agencies 
released 
final 
implementing 
regulations 
on 
December 
10, 
2013, 
providing 
for 
an 
extended 
conformance 
date 
through 
July 
21, 
2015, 
which 
has 
been 
extended 
for 
one 
year 
(and 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
extended 
one 
additional 
year) 
for 
a 
limited 
subset 
of 
covered 
fund 
holdings 
and 
activities.
The 
V
olcker 
Rule 
generally 
prohibits 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
from 
(i) 
engaging 
in 
proprietary 
trading 
for 
its 
own 
account, 
(ii) 
acquiring 
or 
retaining 
an 
ownership 
interest 
in 
or 
sponsoring 
a 
ﬁcovered 
fund,ﬂ 
and 
(iii) 
entering 
into 
certain 
relationships 
with 
a 
ﬁcovered 
fund,ﬂ 
all 
subject 
to 
certain 
exceptions. 
The 
V
olcker 
Rule 
also 
specifies 
certain 
limited 
activities 
in 
which 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
may 
continue 
to 
engage.
The 
V
olcker 
Rule 
will 
further 
restrict 
and 
limit 
the 
types 
of 
activities 
in 
which 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
may 
engage. 
Moreover
, 
it 
will 
require 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
to 
adopt 
complex 
compliance 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
systems 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
compliance 
with 
the 
rule 
while 
engaging 
in 
activities 
that 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
currently 
conduct.
The 
Patriot 
Act
 
substantially 
broadened 
existing 
anti-money 
laundering 
legislation 
and 
the 
extraterritorial 
jurisdiction 
of 
the 
U.S. 
It 
imposes 
compliance 
and 
due 
diligence 
obligations; 
creates 
crimes 
and 
penalties; 
compels 
the 
production 
of 
documents 
located 
both 
inside 
and 
outside 
the 
U.S., 
including 
those 
of 
non-U.S. 
institutions 
that 
have 
a 
correspondent 
relationship 
in 
the 
U.S.; 
and 
clarifies 
the 
safe 
harbor 
from 
civil 
liability 
to 
clients. 
The 
U.S. 
T
reasury 
has 
issued 
a 
number 
of 
regulations 
that 
further 
clarify 
the 
Patriot 
Act
's 
requirements 
or 
provide 
more 
specific 
guidance 
on 
their 
application. 
The 
Patriot 
Act
 
requires 
all 
ﬁfinancial 
institutions,ﬂ 
as 
defined, 
to 
establish 
certain 
anti-money 
laundering 
compliance 
and 
due 
diligence 
programs. 
The 
Patriot 
Act
 
requires 
financial 
institutions 
that 
maintain 
correspondent 
accounts 
for 
non-U.S. 
institutions, 
or 
persons 
that 
are 
involved 
in 
private 
banking 
for 
ﬁnon-U.S. 
personsﬂ 
or 
their 
representatives, 
to 
establish, 
ﬁappropriate, 
specific 
and, 
where 
necessary
, 
enhanced 
due 
diligence 
policies, 
procedures, 
and 
controls 
that 
are 
reasonably 
designed 
to 
detect 
and 
report 
instances 
of 
money 
laundering 
through 
those 
accounts.ﬂ 
Recently 
the 
Financial 
Crimes 
Enforcement 
Network, 
which 
drafts 
regulations 
implementing 
the 
Patriot 
Act
 
and 
other 
anti-money 
laundering 
and 
bank 
secrecy 
act 
legislation, 
proposed 
a 
rule 
that 
would 
require 
financial 
institutions 
to 
obtain 
beneficial 
ownership 
information 
with 
respect 
to 
all 
legal 
entities 
with 
which 
such 
institutions 
conduct 
business. 
The 
scope 
and 
compliance 
requirements 
of 
such 
a 
rule 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
formalized 
or 
completed. 
Bank 
regulators 
are 
focusing 
their 
examinations 
on 
anti-money 
laundering 
compliance, 
and 
the 
Company 
continues 
to 
enhance 
its 
anti-
money 
laundering 
compliance 
programs.
During 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
201
1, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve's 
final 
rules 
related 
to 
debit 
card 
interchange 
fees 
became 
ef
fective. 
These 
rules 
significantly 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
interchange 
fees 
that 
the 
Company 
may 
char
ge 
for 
electronic 
debit 
transactions. 
Similarly
, 
in 
2009, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
adopted 
amendments 
to 
its 
Regulation 
E 
that 
restrict 
the 
Company's 
ability 
to 
char
ge 
its 
clients 
overdraft 
fees 
for 
A
TM 
and 
everyday 
debit 
card 
transactions. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
adopted 
regulation, 
clients 
must 
opt-
in 
to 
an 
overdraft 
service 
in 
order 
for 
banks 
to 
collect 
overdraft 
fees. 
Overdraft 
fees 
represent 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
noninterest 
fees 
collected 
by 
the 
Company's 
banking 
subsidiary
. 
The 
CFPB
 
also 
has 
amended 
Regulation 
E 
to 
impose 
certain 
disclosure 
and 
other 
requirements 
on 
the 
Company™
s 
provision 
of 
electronic 
funds 
transfer 
services 
for 
U.S. 
consumers 
to 
recipients 
in 
other 
countries.
Pursuant 
to 
the 
Riegle-Neal 
Interstate 
Banking 
and 
Branching 
Ef
ficiency 
Act 
of 
1994, 
and, 
as 
amended 
by 
the 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act, 
bank 
holding 
companies 
from 
any 
state 
may 
acquire 
banks 
located 
in 
any 
other 
state, 
subject 
to 
certain 
conditions, 
including 
concentration 
limits. 
Additionally
, 
a 
bank 
may 
6
establish 
branches 
across 
state 
lines 
by 
mer
ging 
with 
a 
bank 
in 
another 
state 
subject 
to 
certain 
restrictions. 
A
 
BHC
 
may 
not 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
acquire 
ownership 
or 
control 
of 
more 
than 
5% 
of 
the 
voting 
shares 
or 
substantially 
all 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
any

mer
ge 
or 
consolidate 
with 
another 
BHC
 
without 
the 
prior 
approval 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve. 
Under 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
a 
BHC
 
may 
not 
acquire 
another 
bank, 
or 
engage 
in 
new 
activities 
that 
are 
financial 
in 
nature 
or 
acquire 
a 
non-bank

engages 
in 
activities 
that 
are 
financial 
in 
nature, 
unless 
the 
BHC
 
is 
both 
"well 
capitalized" 
and 
deemed 
by 
the 
Federal

to 
be 
"well 
managed." 
Moreover
, 
a 
bank

On 
July€21, 
2010, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
other 
regulators 
jointly 
published 
final 
guidance 
for 
structuring 
incentive 
compensation 
arrangements 
at 
financial 
or
ganizations. 
The 
guidance 
does 
not 
set 
forth 
any 
formulas 
or 
pay 
caps 
for
, 
but 
contains 
certain 
principles 
which 
companies 
are 
required 
to 
follow 
with 
respect 
to 
employees 
and 
groups 
of 
employees 
that 
may 
expose 
the 
company 
to 
material 
amounts 
of 
risk. 
The 
three 
primary 
principles 
are 
(i)€balanced 
risk-taking 
incentives, 
(ii)€compatibility 
with 
ef
fective 
controls 
and 
risk 
management, 
and 
(iii)€strong 
corporate 
governance. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
will 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
this 
guidance 
as 
part 
of 
its 
safety 
and 
soundness 
oversight.
Competition
The 
Company's 
primary 
operating 
footprint 
is 
in 
the 
Southeast 
and 
Mid-Atlantic 
U.S., 
though 
certain 
lines 
of 
business 
serve 
broader
, 
national 
markets.€
W
ithin 
those 
markets 
the 
Company 
faces 
competition 
from 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
lending 
institutions 
and 
numerous 
other 
providers 
of 
financial 
services. 
The 
Company 
competes 
using 
a 
client-centered 
model 
that 
focuses 
on 
high 
quality 
service, 
while 
of
fering 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
products 
and 
services.€
The 
Company 
believes 
that 
this 
approach 
better 
positions 
it 
to 
increase 
loyalty 
and 
expand 
relationships 
with 
current 
clients 
and 
attract 
new 
ones.€Further
, 
the 
Company 
maintains 
a 
strong 
presence 
within 
select 
markets, 
thereby 
enhancing 
its 
competitive 
position.
While 
the 
Company 
believes 
it 
is 
well 
positioned 
within 
the 
highly 
competitive 
financial-services 
industry
, 
the 
industry 
could 
become 
even 
more 
competitive 
as 
a 
result 
of 
legislative, 
regulatory
, 
economic, 
and 
technological 
changes, 
as 
well 
as 
continued 
consolidation.€
The 
ability 
of 
non-banking 
financial 
institutions 
to 
provide 
services 
previously 
limited 
to 
commercial 
banks 
has 
intensified 
competition. 
Because 
non-banking 
financial 
institutions 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
many 
of 
the 
same 
regulatory 
restrictions 
as 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
companies, 
they 
can 
often 
operate 
with 
greater 
flexibility 
and 
lower 
cost 
structures. 
However
, 
non-banking 
financial 
institutions 
may 
not 
have 
the 
same 
access 
to 
deposit 
funds 
or 
government 
programs 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
those 
non-banking 
financial 
institutions 
may 
elect, 
as 
some 
have 
done, 
to 
become 
financial 
holding 
companies 
and 
gain 
such 
access. 
Securities 
firms 
and 
insurance 
companies 
that 
elect 
to 
become 
financial 
holding 
companies 
may 
acquire 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
institutions. 
This 
could 
alter 
the 
competitive 
environment 
in 
which 
the 
Company 
conducts 
business. 
Some 
of 
the 
Company's 
competitors 
have 
greater 
financial 
resources 
or 
face 
fewer 
regulatory 
constraints. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
various 
sources 
of 
competition, 
the 
Company 
could 
lose 
business 
to 
competitors 
or 
be 
forced 
to 
price 
products 
and 
services 
on 
less 
advantageous 
terms 
to 
retain 
or 
attract 
clients.
Employees
At 
December€31, 
2014, 
the 
Company 
had 
24,638 
full-time 
equivalent 
employees. 
None 
of 
the 
domestic 
employees 
within 
the 
Company 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
collective 
bar
gaining 
agreement. 
Management 
considers 
its 
employee 
relations 
to 
be 
good.

RISK 
F
ACT
ORS
The 
risks 
described 
in 
this 
Form 
10-K 
are 
not 
the 
only 
risks 
we 
face. 
Additional 
risks 
that 
are 
not 
presently 
known 
or 
that 
we 
presently 
deem 
to 
be 
immaterial 
also 
could

a 
material 
adverse 
ef
fect 
on 
our 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations, 
business, 
and 
prospects.
As 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
lenders 
in 
the 
Southeast 
and 
Mid-
Atlantic 
U.S. 
and 
a 
pr

our
 
financial 
r
esults 
have 
been, 
and 
may 
continue 
to 
be, 
materially 
affected 
by 
general 
economic 
conditions. 
A
 
deterioration 
of 
economic 
conditions 
or
 
of 
the 
financial 
markets 
may 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
our
 
lending 
and 
other
 
businesses 
and 
our
 
financial 
r
esults 
and 
condition.
W
e 
generate 
revenue 
from 
the 
interest 
and 
fees 
we 
char
ge 
on 
the 
loans 
and 
other 
products 
and 
services 
we 
provide, 
and 
a 
substantial 
amount 
of 
our 
revenue 
and 
earnings 
come 
from 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
fee 
income 
that 
we 
earn 
from 
our 
consumer
, 
wholesale, 
and 
mortgage 
banking 
businesses. 
These 
businesses 
have 
been, 
and 
may 
continue 
to 
be, 
materially 
af
fected 
by 
the 
state 
of 
the 
U.S. 
economy
, 
particularly 
unemployment 
levels 
and 
home 
prices. 
Although 
the 
U.S. 
economy 
has 
continued 
to 
gradually 
improve 
from 
severely 
depressed 
levels 
during 
the 
last 
economic 
recession, 
economic 
growth 
and 
improvement 
in 
the 
housing 
market 
have 
been 
modest. 
In 
addition, 
financial 
uncertainty 
stemming 
from 
low 
oil 
and 
commodity 
prices, 
a 
strong 
U.S. 
dollar
, 
U.S. 
debt 
and 
budget 
matters, 
geopolitical 
turmoil, 
deceleration 
of 
economic 
activity 
in 
other 
lar
ge 
countries, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
financial 
regulatory 
reform, 
have 
impacted 
and 
may 
continue 
to 
impact 
the 
continuing 
global 
economic 
recovery
. 
A
 
prolonged 
period 
of 
slow 
growth 
in 
the 
U.S. 
economy 
or 
any 
deterioration 
in 
general 
economic 
conditions 
and/or 
the 
financial 
markets 
resulting 
from 
the 
above 
matters, 
or 
any 
other 
events 
or 
factors 
that 
may 
disrupt 
or 
dampen 
the 
global 
economic 
recovery
, 
could 
materially 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
financial 
results 
and 
condition.
If 
unemployment 
levels 
increase 
or 
if 
home 
prices 
decrease 
we 
would 
expect 
to 
incur 
higher 
than 
normal 
char
ge-of
fs 
and 
provision 
expense 
from 
increases 
in 
our 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses. 
These 
conditions 
may 
adversely 
af
fect 
not 
only 
consumer 
loan 
performance 
but 
also 
C&I 
and 
CRE 
loans, 
especially 
for 
those 
businesses 
that 
rely 
on 
the 
health 
of 
industries 
or 
properties 
that 
may 
experience 
deteriorating 
economic 
conditions. 
The 
ability 
of 
these 
borrowers 
to 
repay 
their 
loans 
may 
be 
reduced, 
causing 
us 
to 
incur 
significantly 
higher 
credit 
losses. 
In 
addition, 
current 
economic 
conditions 
have 
made 
it 
more 
challenging 
for 
us 
to 
increase 
our 
consumer 
and 
commercial 
loan 
portfolios 
by 
making 
loans 
to 
creditworthy 
borrowers 
at 
attractive 
yields. 
If 
economic 
conditions 
do 
not 
continue 
to 
improve 
or 
if 
the 
economy 
worsens 
and 
unemployment 
rises, 
then 
a 
decrease 
in 
consumer 
and 
business 
confidence 
and 
spending 
are 
likely
, 
which 
may 
reduce 
demand 
for 
our 
credit 
products, 
which 
would 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
interest 
and 
fee 
income 
and 
our 
earnings.
A
 
deterioration 
in 
business 
and 
economic 
conditions 
that 
erodes 
consumer 
and 
investor 
confidence 
levels, 
and/or 
increased 
volatility 
of 
financial 
markets, 
also 
could 
adversely 
af
fect 
financial 
results 
for 
our 
fee-based 
businesses, 
including 
our 
wealth 
management, 
investment 
advisory
, 
trading, 
and 
investment 
banking 
businesses. 
W

from 
managing 
assets 
for 
others 
and 
providing 
brokerage 
and 
other 
investment 
advisory 
and 
wealth 
management 
services. 
Because 
investment 
management 
fees 
are 
often 
based 
on 
the 
value 
of 
assets 
under 
management, 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
market 
prices 
of 
those 
assets 
could 
reduce 
our 
fee 
income. 
Changes 
in 
stock 
market 
prices 
could 
af
fect 
the 
trading 
activity 
of 
investors, 
reducing 
commissions 
and 
other 
fees 
we 
earn 
from 
our 
brokerage 
business. 
Poor 
economic 
conditions 
and 
volatile 
or 
unstable 
financial 
markets 
also 
can 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
trading 
and 
debt 
and 
equity 
underwriting 
and 
advisory 
businesses.
Legislation 
and 
r
egulation, 
including 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
as 
well 
as 
futur
e 
legislation 
and/or
 
r
egulation, 
could 
r
equir
e 
us 
to 
change 
certain 
of 
our
 
business 
practices, 
r
educe 
our
 
r
evenue, 
impose 
additional 
costs 
on

or
 
otherwise 
adversely 
affect 
our
 
business 
operations 
and/or
 
competitive 
position.
W

actively 
regulated 
by 
federal 
and 
state

Changes 
to 
statutes, 
regulations, 
or 
regulatory 
policies, 
including 
interpretation 
or 
implementation 
of 
statutes, 
regulations, 
or 
policies, 
could 
af
fect 
us 
adversely
, 
including 
limiting 
the 
types 
of 
financial 
services 
and 
products 
we 
may 
of
fer 
and/or 
increasing 
the 
ability 
of 
nonbanks 
to 
of
fer 
competing 
financial 
services 
and 
products. 
Also, 
if 
we 
do 
not 
comply 
with 
laws, 
regulations, 
or 
policies, 
we 
could 
be 
subject 
to 
regulatory 
sanctions 
and 
damage 
to 
our 
reputation.
Regulation 
of 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
has 
increased 
significantly
. 
The 
regulation 
is 
focused 
on 
the 
protection 
of 
depositors, 
FDIC
 
funds, 
consumers, 
and 
the 
banking 
system 
as 
a 
whole, 
rather 
than 
our 
shareholders, 
and 
may 
be 
adverse 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
our 
shareholders. 
W
e 
are 
subject 
to 
significant 
regulation 
under 
state 
and 
federal 
laws 
in 
the 
U.S., 
including 
new 
legislation 
and 
rule-making 
promulgated 
under 
the 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act. 
Increased 
supervision, 
reporting, 
and 
significant 
new 
and 
proposed 
legislation 
and 
regulatory 
requirements 
in 
the 
U.S. 
and 
in 
other 
jurisdictions 
outside 
of 
the 
U.S. 
where 
we 
conduct 
business 
may 
af
fect 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
we 
do 
business 
and 
the 
products 
and 
services 
that 
we 
provide, 
and 
may 
af
fect 
or 
restrict 
our 
ability 
to 
compete 
in 
our 
current 
businesses 
or 
our 
ability 
to 
enter 
into 
or 
acquire 
new 
businesses, 
reduce 
or 
limit 
our 
revenue 
in 
businesses 
or 
impose 
additional 
fees, 
assessments 
or 
taxes 
on 
us, 
and 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
business 
operations 
or 
have 
other 
negative 
consequences.
A
 
significant 
number 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
still 
require 
extensive 
rulemaking 
and 
interpretation 
by 
regulatory 
authorities. 
In 
several 
cases, 
authorities 
have 
extended 
implementation 
periods 
and 
delayed 
ef
fective 
dates. 
Accordingly
, 
in 
many 
respects 
the 
ultimate 
impact 
of 
the 
Dodd-
Frank 
Act 
and 
its 
ef
fects 
on 
the 
U.S. 
financial 
system 
and 
SunT
rust 
will 
not 
be 
known 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, 
including 
current 
and 
future 
rules 
implementing 
its 
provisions 
and 
the 
interpretation 
of 
those 
rules, 
could 
result 
in 
a 
loss 
of 
revenue, 
require 
us 
to 
change 
certain 
of 
our 
business 
practices, 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
pursue 
certain 
business 
opportunities, 
increase 
our 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
requirements 
and 
impose 
additional 
assessments 
and 
costs 
on 
8
us, 
and 
otherwise 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
business 
operations 
and 
have 
other 
negative 
consequences. 
For 
example, 
on 
October 
1, 
201
1, 
final 
rules 
issued 
by 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
became 
ef
fective 
which 
limit 
the 
fees 
we 
can 
char
ge 
for 
debit 
card 
interchange, 
and 
this 
has 
reduced 
our 
noninterest 
income. 
In 
addition, 
several 
recent 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
initiatives 
were 
adopted 
that 
have 
had 
an 
impact 
on 
our 
businesses 
and 
financial 
results, 
including 
FRB 
and 
CFPB
 
amendments 
to 
Regulation 
E 
which, 
among 
other 
things, 
af
fect 
the 
way 
we 
may 
char
ge 
overdraft 
fees 
and 
our 
provision 
of 
electronic 
funds 
transfer 
services 
for 
U.S. 
consumers 
to 
recipients 
in 
other 
countries. 
W
e 
also 
implemented 
policy 
changes 
to 
help 
customers 
limit 
overdraft 
and 
returned 
item 
fees. 
These 
reduced 
our 
fee 
revenue.
The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
also 
established 
the 
CFPB
, 
which 
has 
authority 
to 
regulate, 
among 
other 
things, 
unfair
, 
deceptive, 
or 
abusive 
acts 
or 
practices. 
The 
CFPB
 
has 
been 
active 
in 
rule-
making 
and 
enforcement 
activity
, 
and 
already 
has 
imposed 
substantial 
fines 
on 
other 
financial 
institutions. 
Among 
its 
other 
consumer
-protective 
initiatives, 
the 
CFPB
 
has 
placed 
significant 
emphasis 
on 
consumer 
complaint 
management. 
The 
CFPB
 
has 
established 
a 
public 
consumer 
complaint 
database 
to 
encourage 
consumers 
to 
file 
complaints 
they 
may 
have 
against 
financial 
institutions, 
which 
the 
CFPB
 
may 
use 
to 
focus 
enforcement 
actions 
and 
for 
rule-making. 
In 
addition, 
each 
financial 
institution 
is 
expected 
to 
maintain 
an 
ef
fective 
consumer 
complaint 
management 
program. 
Further
, 
in 
2013 
the 
CFPB
 
released 
final 
regulations 
under 
T
itle 
XIV
 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
in 
2013 
further 
regulating 
the 
origination 
of 
mortgages 
and 
addressing 
"ability 
to 
repay" 
standards, 
loan 
of
ficer 
compensation, 
appraisal 
disclosures, 
HOEP
A
 
triggers 
and 
other 
matters. 
The 
"ability 
to 
repay" 
rule, 
in 
particular
, 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
significantly 
af
fect 
our 
business 
since 
it 
provides 
a 
borrower 
with 
a 
defense 
to 
foreclosure 
unless 
the 
lender 
established 
the 
borrower's 
ability 
to 
repay 
or 
that 
the 
loan 
was 
a 
"qualified 
mortgage" 
or 
met 
other 
exceptions 
to 
the 
rule. 
While 
qualified 
mortgages 
may 
provide 
certain 
safe 
harbors, 
the 
extent 
of 
these 
safe 
harbors 
remains 
unclear
. 
Our 
business 
strategy
, 
product 
of
ferings, 
and 
profitability 
may 
be 
af
fected 
by 
CFPB
 
rules 
and 
may 
change 
as 
these 
and 
other 
rules 
are 
developed, 
become 
ef
fective, 
and 
are 
interpreted 
by 
the 
regulators 
and 
courts.
Regulators 
recently 
published 
revised 
guidance 
which 
could 
af
fect 
the 
origination 
and 
distribution 
of 
leveraged 
loans. 
While 
we 
believe 
we 
comply 
with 
relevant 
regulatory 
requirements, 
regulators 
may 
limit 
the 
ability 
of 
banks 
to 
originate 
leveraged 
loans, 
such 
as 
by 
limiting 
the 
maximum 
leverage 
of 
issuers 
of 
such 
loans, 
or 
may 
limit 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
banks 
may 
hold 
leveraged 
loans 
in 
their 
loan 
portfolios. 
If 
regulators 
tighten 
leverage 
limits, 
structural 
elements 
including 
covenants 
or 
maturities, 
such 
actions 
could 
result 
in 
lower 
loan 
origination 
volumes 
and 
fees. 
If 
regulators 
impose 
portfolio 
limits, 
this 
could 
reduce 
the 
liquidity 
of 
leveraged 
loans, 
and 
may 
indirectly 
af
fect 
their 
value.
A
 
portion 
of 
our 
revenue 
comes 
from 
fees 
we 
char
ge 
clients 
for 
certain 
services 
that 
we 
provide 
to 
them, 
including 
fees 
for 
having 
insuf
ficient 
funds 
in 
their 
accounts. 
The 
CFPB
 
may 
issue 
rules 
that 
limit 
the 
fees 
we 
may 
char
ge, 
such 
as 
by 
setting 
a 
dollar 
or 
number 
limit 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
such 
fees. 
Other 
regulatory 
changes 
may 
cause 
us 
to 
change 
the 
order 
in 
which 
we 
process 
checks. 
Any 
of 
these 
changes 
might 
adversely 
af
fect 
fee 
revenue.
Additionally
, 
legislation 
or 
regulation 
may 
impose 
unexpected 
or 
unintended 
consequences, 
the 
impact 
of 
which 
is 
dif
ficult 
to 
predict. 
For 
example, 
some 
commentators 
have 
expressed 
a 
view 
that 
proposed 
liquidity 
requirements, 
which 
will 
require 
certain 
banks 
to 
hold 
more 
liquid 
securities, 
may 
have 
the 
unintended 
consequence 
of 
reducing 
the 
size 
of 
the 
trading 
markets 
for 
such 
securities, 
and 
thereby 
reduce 
liquidity 
in 
those 
markets.
Any 
other 
future 
legislation 
and/or 
regulation, 
if 
adopted, 
also 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
ef
fect 
on 
our 
business 
operations, 
income, 
and/or 
competitive 
position 
and 
may 
have 
other 
negative 
consequences.

W
e 
ar
e 
subject 
to 
changing 
capital 
adequacy 
and 
liquidity 
guidelines 
and, 
if 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
new 
guidelines, 
our
 
financial 
condition 
would 
be 
adversely 
affected.
W
e, 
together 
with 
our 
banking 
subsidiary 
and 
broker
-dealer 
subsidiaries, 
must 
meet 
certain 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
guidelines, 
subject 
to 
qualitative 
judgments 
by 
regulators 
about 
components, 
risk 
weightings, 
and 
other 
factors. 
New 
regulatory 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
requirements 
may 
limit 
or 
otherwise 
restrict 
how 
we 
utilize 
our 
capital, 
including 
common 
stock 
dividends 
and 
stock 
repurchases, 
and 
may 
require 
us 
to 
increase 
our 
capital 
and/or 
liquidity
. 
Any 
requirement 
that 
we 
increase 
our 
regulatory 
capital, 
replace 
certain 
capital 
instruments 
which 
presently 
qualify 
as 
T
ier

or 
increase 
regulatory 
capital 
ratios 
or 
liquidity
, 
could 
require 
us 
to 
liquidate 
assets 
or 
otherwise 
change 
our 
business 
and/or 
investment 
plans, 
which 
may 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
financial 
results. 
Issuing 
additional 
common 
stock 
would 
dilute 
the 
ownership 
of 
existing 
stockholders. 
Specifically
, 
our 
primary 
regulatory
, 
along 
with 
other 
banking 
regulators, 
have 
implemented 
new 
and 
more 
stringent 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
measurements 
that 
will 
impact 
us.
In 
July 
2013, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
issued 
final 
capital 
rules 
that 
replace 
existing 
capital 
adequacy 
rules 
and 
implement 
Basel 
III 
and 
certain 
requirements 
imposed 
by 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act. 
These 
rules 
will 
result 
in 
higher 
and 
more 
stringent 
capital 
requirements 
for 
us 
and 
our 
banking 
subsidiary 
than 
under 
the 
prior 
rules. 
Under 
the 
final 
rules, 
our 
capital 
requirements 
will 
increase 
and 
the 
risk-weighting 
of 
many 
of 
our 
assets 
will 
change. 
Further
, 
in 
September
, 
2014, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
adopted 
a 
final 
LCR 
rule 
under 
the 
Basel 
III 
framework 
that 
requires 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
companies 
to 
measure 
their 
liquidity 
against 
specific 
liquidity 
tests. 
The 
tests, 
which 
include 
an 
LCR, 
are 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
banking 
entity 
maintains 
a 
level 
of 
unencumbered 
high-quality 
liquid 
assets 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
entity's 
expected 
net 
cash 
outflow 
for 
a 
specified 
time 
horizon 
under 
an 
acute 
liquidity 
stress 
scenario. 
Also 
part 
of 
the 
LCR 
rule, 
an 
NSFR 
was 
designed 
to 
promote 
more 
medium 
and 
long-term 
funding 
based 
on 
the 
liquidity 
characteristics 
of 
the 
assets 
and 
activities 
of 
banking 
entities 
over 
a 
one-year 
time 
horizon. 
Under 
the 
LCR 
rule 
our 
holdings 
of 
high-quality 
liquid 
assets 
will 
increase 
and 
the 
composition 
of 
our 
balance 
sheet 
will 
change.
Under 
the 
final 
capital 
rules, 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
will 
consist 
of 
CET
 
1 
and 
additional 
non-common 
T
ier 
1 
capital, 
with 
T
ier 
1 
9
capital 
plus 
T
ier 
2 
capital 
constituting 
total 
risk-based 
capital. 
The 
required 
minimum 
capital 
requirements 
will 
be 
greater 
than 
currently 
required 
and 
include 
a 
CET
 
1 
ratio 
of 
4.5%; 
a 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
ratio 
of 
6%, 
and 
a 
total 
capital 
ratio 
of 
8%. 
In 
addition, 
a 
T
ier 
1 
leverage 
ratio 
to 
average 
consolidated 
assets 
of 
4% 
will 
apply
. 
Further
, 
we 
will 
be 
required 
to 
maintain 
a 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer 
of 
2.5% 
of 
additional 
CET
 
1 
after 
a 
transition 
period 
to 
phase-in 
the 
buf
fer
. 
If 
we 
do 
not 
maintain 
the 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer
, 
then 
our 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends 
and 
discretionary 
bonuses 
and 
to 
make 
share 
repurchases 
will 
be 
restricted. 
A
 
transition 
period 
applies 
to 
certain 
capital 
elements 
and 
risk 
weighted 
assets. 
One 
of 
the 
more 
significant 
transitions 
required 
by 
the 
final 
rules 
relates 
to 
the 
risk 
weighting 
applied 
to 
MSRs, 
which 
will 
impact 
the 
CET1 
ratio 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
currently 
disclosed 
CET1 
ratio 
that 
is 
calculated 
on 
a 
fully 
phased-in 
basis. 
Specifically
, 
the 
fully 
phased-in 
risk 
weight 
of 
MSRs 
is 
250%, 
while 
the 
risk 
weight 
to 
be 
applied 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
is 
100%. 
The 
transition 
period 
is 
applicable 
from 
January 
1, 
2015 
through 
December 
31, 
2017.
 
W
e 
have 
estimated 
our 
regulatory 
capital 
under 
Basel 
III 
under 
the 
final 
rules 
and 
we 
provide 
that 
estimate, 
on 
a 
fully 
phased-in 
basis,

Note 
that 
this

is 
consistent 
with 
our 
interpretation 
of 
the 
final 
rule 
and 
ambiguities 
in 
the 
final 
rule

interpretations 
of 
the

As 
and 
consequently 
a

Loss 
of

to 
be 
a 
low

and 
stable 
source 
of 
funding 
for 
the 
loans 
we 
make. 
W
e 
compete 
with 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
services 
companies 
for 
deposits. 
If 
our 
competitors 
raise 
the 
rates 
they 
pay 
on 
deposits, 
our 
funding 
costs 
may 
increase, 
either 
because 
we 
raise 
our 
rates 
to 
avoid 
losing 
deposits 
or 
because 
we 
lose 
deposits 
and 
must 
rely 
on 
more 
expensive 
sources 
of 
funding. 
Higher 
funding 
costs 
reduce 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
and 
net 
interest 
income.
W
e 
r
ely 
on 
the 
mortgage 
secondary 
market 
and 
GSEs 
for
 
some 
of 
our
 
liquidity
.
W
e 
sell 
most 
of 
the 
mortgage 
loans 
we 
originate 
to 
reduce 
our 
credit 
risk 
and 
to 
provide 
funding 
for 
additional 
loans. 
W
e 
rely 
on 
GSEs 
to 
purchase 
loans 
that 
meet 
their 
conforming 
loan 
requirements. 
W
e 
rely 
on 
other 
capital 
markets 
investors 
to 
purchase 
non-conforming 
loans 
(i.e., 
loans 
that 
do 
not 
meet 
GSE 
requirements). 
Since 
2007, 
investor 
demand 
for 
nonconforming 
loans 
has 
fallen 
sharply
, 
increasing 
credit 
spreads 
and 
reducing 
the 
liquidity 
of 
those 
loans. 
In 
response 
to 
the 
reduced 
liquidity 
in 
the 
capital 
markets, 
we 
may 
retain 
more 
nonconforming 
loans, 
negatively 
impacting 
reserves, 
or 
we 
may 
originate 
less, 
negatively 
impacting 
revenue. 
When 
we 
retain 
a 
loan 
not 
only 
do 
we 
keep 
the 
credit 
risk 
of 
the 
loan 
but 
we 
also 
do 
not 
receive 
any 
sale 
proceeds 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
generate 
new 
loans. 
A
 
persistent 
lack 
of 
liquidity 
could 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
fund 
and 
thus 
originate 
new 
mortgage 
loans, 
reducing 
the 
fees 
we 
earn 
from 
originating 
and 
servicing 
loans. 
In 
addition, 
we 
cannot 
provide 
assurance 
that 
GSEs 
will 
not 
materially 
limit 
their 
purchases 
of 
conforming 
loans 
due 
to 
capital 
constraints 
or 
change 
their 
criteria 
for 
conforming 
loans 
(e.g., 
maximum 
loan 
amount 
or 
borrower 
eligibility). 
As 
previously 
noted, 
proposals 
have 
been 
presented 
to 
reform 
the 
housing 
finance 
market 
in 
the 
U.S., 
including 
the 
role 
of 
the 
GSEs 
in 
the 
housing 
finance 
market. 
The 
extent 
and 
timing 
of 
any 
such 
regulatory 
reform 
regarding 
the 
housing 
finance 
market 
and 
the 
GSEs, 
as 
well 
as 
any 
ef
fect 
on 
our 
business 
and 
financial 
results, 
are 
uncertain.
Our
 
framework 
for
 
managing 
risks 
may 
not 
be 
effective 
in 
mitigating 
risk 
and 
loss 
to 
us.
Our 
risk 
management 
framework 
seeks 
to 
mitigate 
risk 
and 
loss 
to 
us. 
W
e 
have 
established 
processes 
and 
procedures 
intended 
to 
identify
, 
measure, 
monitor
, 
report 
and 
analyze 
the 
types 
of 
risk 
to 
which 
we 
are 
subject, 
including 
liquidity 
risk, 
credit 
risk, 
market 
risk, 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
operational 
risk, 
legal 
and 
compliance 
risk, 
and 
reputational 
risk, 
among 
others. 
However
, 
as 
with 
any 
risk 
management 
framework, 
there 
are 
inherent 
limitations 
to 
our 
risk 
management 
strategies 
as 
there 
may 
exist, 
or 
develop 
in 
the 
future, 
risks 
that 
we 
have 
not 
appropriately 
anticipated 
or 
identified. 
The 
recent 
financial 
and 
credit 
crisis 
and 
resulting 
regulatory 
reform 
highlighted 
both 
the 
importance 
and 
some 
of 
the 
limitations 
of 
managing 
unanticipated 
risks. 
If 
our 
risk 
management 
framework 
proves 
inef
fective, 
we 
could 
suf
fer 
unexpected 
losses 
and 
could 
be 
materially 
adversely 
af
fected.

into 
a 
letter 
of 
credit 
or 
other 
contract 
with 
a 
counterparty
, 
we 
incur 
credit 
risk, 
which 
is 
the 
risk 
of 
losses 
if 
our 
borrowers 
do 
not 
repay 
their 
loans 
or 
our 
counterparties 
fail 
to 
perform 
according 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
their

A
 
number 
of 
our 
products 
expose 
us 
to 
credit 
risk, 
including 
loans, 
leveraged 
loans, 
leases 
and 
lending

derivatives, 
trading 
assets, 
insurance 
arrangements 
with 
respect 
to 
such 
products, 
and 
assets 
held 
for

As 
one 
of 
the 
nation's 
lar
gest 
lenders, 
the 
credit 
quality 
of 
our 
portfolio 
can 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
our 
earnings. 
W
e 
estimate 
and 
establish 
reserves 
for 
credit 
risks 
and 
credit 
losses 
inherent 
in 
our 
credit 
exposure 
(including 
unfunded 
credit 
commitments). 
This 
process, 
which 
is 
critical 
to 
our 
financial 
results 
and 
condition, 
requires 
dif
ficult, 
subjective 
and 
complex 
judgments, 
including 
forecasts 
of 
economic 
conditions 
and 
how 
these 
economic 
conditions 
might 
impair 
the 
ability 
of 
our 
borrowers 
to 
repay 
their 
loans. 
As 
is 
the 
case 
with 
any 
such 
assessments, 
there 
is 
always 
the 
chance 
that 
we 
will 
fail 
to 
identify 
the 
proper 
factors 
or 
that 
we 
will 
fail 
to 
accurately 
estimate 
the 
impacts 
of 
factors 
that 
we 
do 
identify
.
W
e 
might 
underestimate 
the 
credit 
losses 
inherent 
in 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
and 
have 
credit 
losses 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
amount 
reserved. 
W
e 
might 
increase 
the 
allowance 
because 
of 
changing 
economic 
conditions, 
including 
falling 
home 
prices 
and 
higher 
unemployment, 
or 
other 
factors 
such 
as 
changes 
in 
borrower 
behavior
. 
As 
an 
example, 
borrowers 
may 
discontinue 
making 
payments 
on 
their 
real 
estate-secured 
loans 
if 
the 
value 
of 
the 
real 
estate 
is 
less 
than 
what 
they 
owe, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
still 
financially 
able 
to 
make 
the 
payments.

While 
we 
believe 
that 
our 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
was 
adequate 
at 
December 
31, 
2014, 
there 
is 
no 
assurance 
that 
it 
will 
be 
suf
ficient 
to 
cover 
all 
incurred 
credit 
losses, 
especially 
if 
economic 
conditions 
worsen. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
significant 
deterioration 
in 
economic 
conditions, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
increase 
reserves 
in 
future 
periods, 
which 
would 
reduce 
our 
earnings.

Our
 
ALLL
 
may 
not 
be 
adequate 
to 
cover
 
our
 
eventual 
losses.
Like 
other 
financial 
institutions, 
we 
maintain 
an 
ALLL
 
to 
provide 
for 
credit 
losses 
associated 
with 
loan 
defaults 
and 
nonperformance. 
Our 
ALLL
 
is 
based 
on 
our 
evaluation 
of 
risks 
associated 
with 
our 
LHFI 
portfolio, 
including 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
expected 
loss 
calculations, 
delinquencies, 
performing 
status, 
the 
size 
and 
composition 
of 
the 
loan 
portfolio, 
economic 
conditions, 
and 
concentrations 
within 
the 
portfolio. 
Current 
economic 
conditions 
in 
the 
U.S. 
and 
in 
our 
markets 
could 
deteriorate, 
which 
could 
result 
in, 
among 
other 
things, 
greater 
than 
expected 
deterioration 
in 
credit 
quality 
of 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
or 
in 
the 
value 
of 
collateral 
securing 
these 
loans. 
Our 
ALLL
 
may 
not 
be 
adequate 
to 
cover 
eventual 
loan 
losses, 
and 
future 
provisions 
for 
loan 
losses 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. 
Additionally
, 
in 
order 
to 
maximize 
the 
collection 
of 
loan 
balances, 
we 
sometimes 
modify 
loan 
terms 
when 
there 
is 
a 
reasonable 
chance 
that 
an 
appropriate 
modification 
would 
allow 
our 
client 
to 
continue 
servicing 
the 
debt. 
If 
such 
modifications 
ultimately 
are 
less 
ef
fective 
at 
mitigating 
loan 
losses 
than 
we 
expect, 
we 
may 
incur 
losses 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
specific 
amount 
of 
ALLL
 
associated 
with 
a 
modified 
loan, 
and 
this 
would 
result 
in 
additional 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses.
In 
2012, 
the 
F
ASB
 
issued 
for 
public 
comment 
a 
Proposed 
ASU
, 
Financial 
Instruments-Credit 
Losses 
(Subtopic 
825-15) 
(the 
Credit 
Loss 
Proposal), 
that 
would 
substantially 
change 
the 
accounting 
for 
credit 
losses 
under 
U.S. 
GAAP
. 
Under 
U.S. 
GAAP's 
current 
standards, 
credit 
losses 
are 
not 
reflected 
in 
the 
financial 
statements 
until 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
the 
credit 
loss 
has 
been 
incurred. 
Under 
the 
Credit 
Loss 
Proposal, 
an 
entity 
would 
reflect 
in 
its 
financial 
statements 
its 
current 
estimate 
of 
credit 
losses 
on 
financial 
assets 
over 
the 
expected 
life 
of 
each 
financial 
asset. 
The 
Credit 
Loss 
Proposal, 
if 
adopted 
as 
proposed, 
may 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
our 
reported 
earnings, 
capital, 
regulatory 
capital 
ratios, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
regulatory 
limits 
which 
are 
based 
on 
capital 
(e.g., 
loans 
to 
af
filiates) 
since 
it 
would 
accelerate 
the 
recognition 
of 
estimated 
credit 
losses.
W
e 
may 
have 
mor
e 
cr
edit 
risk 
and 
higher
 
cr
edit 
losses 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
our
 
loans 
ar
e 
concentrated 
by 
loan 
type, 
industry 
segment, 
borr
ower
 
type, 
or
 
location 
of 
the 
borr
ower
 
or
 
collateral.
Our 
credit 
risk 
and 
credit 
losses 
can 
increase 
if 
our 
loans 
are 
concentrated 
in 
borrowers 
engaged 
in 
the 
same 
or 
similar 
activities 
or 
in 
borrowers 
who 
as 
a 
group 
may 
be 
uniquely 
or 
disproportionately 
af
fected 
by 
economic 
or 
market 
conditions. 
As 
Florida 
is 
our 
lar
gest 
banking 
state 
in 
terms 
of 
loans 
and 
deposits, 
deterioration 
in 
real 
estate 
values 
and 
underlying 
economic 
conditions 
in 
those 
markets 
or 
elsewhere 
could 
result 
in 
materially 
higher 
credit 
losses. 
A
 
deterioration 
in 
economic 
conditions, 
housing 
conditions, 
or 
real

values 
in 
the

we

could 
result

When

sell 
mortgage

pursuant 
to 
a

we 
are

warranties 
to 
the 
purchaser 
about 
the 
mortgage

and 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
they 
were 
originated. 
Between 
2006 
and 
2013, 
we 
received 
an 
elevated 
number 
of 
repurchase 
and 
indemnity 
demands 
from 
purchasers. 
These 
resulted 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
losses 
for 
repurchases. 
In 
September 
2013, 
we 
reached 
a 
settlement 
with 
Fannie 
Mae 
and 
Freddie 
Mac 
to 
address 
outstanding 
and 
potential 
repurchase 
obligations. 
However
, 
the 
2013 
agreements 
with 
Fannie 
Mae 
and 
Freddie 
Mac 
settling 
certain 
aspects 
of 
our 
repurchase 
obligations 
preserve 
their 
right 
to 
require 
repurchases 
arising 
from 
certain 
types 
of 
events, 
and 
that 
preservation 
of 
rights 
can 
impact 
our 
future

While 
the 
repurchase 
reserve 
includes 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
settling 
claims 
related 
to 
required 
repurchases, 
our 
estimate 
of 
losses 
depends 
on 
our 
assumptions 
regarding 
GSE

other 
counterparty 
behavior
, 
loan 
performance, 
home

alternatives 
to 
foreclosure 
such 
as 
loan 
modifications 
or 
short 
sales 
and, 
in 
our 
capacity 
as 
a 
master 
servicer
, 
overseeing 
the 
servicing 
of 
mortgage 
loans 
by 
the 
servicer
. 
Generally
, 
our 
servicing 
obligations 
are 
set 
by 
contract, 
for 
which 
we 
receive 
a 
contractual 
fee. 
However
, 
the 
costs 
to 
perform 
contracted-for 
services 
has 
increased, 
which 
reduces 
our 
profitability
. 
As 
a 
servicer
, 
we 
advance 
expenses 
on 
behalf 
of 
investors 
which 
we 
may 
be 
unable 
to 
collect. 
Further
, 
GSEs 
can 
amend 
their 
servicing 
guidelines, 
which 
can 
increase 
the 
scope 
or 
costs 
of 
the 
services 
we 
are 
required 
to 
perform 
without 
any 
corresponding 
increase 
in 
our 
servicing 
fee. 
Further
, 
the 
CFPB
 
has 
implemented 
national 
servicing 
standards 
which 
have 
increased 
the 
scope 
and 
costs 
of 
services 
which 
we 
are 
required 
to 
perform. 
In 
addition, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
state 
laws 
that 
impose 
additional 
servicing 
requirements 
that 
increase 
the 
scope 
and 
cost 
of 
our 
servicing 
obligations.
If 
we 
commit 
a 
material 
breach 
of 
our 
obligations 
as 
servicer 
or 
master 
servicer
, 
we 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
termination 
if 
the 
breach 
is 
not 
cured 
within 
a 
specified 
period 
of 
time 
following 
notice, 
which 
can 
generally 
be 
given 
by 
the 
securitization 
trustee 
or 
a 
specified 
percentage 
of 
security 
holders, 
causing 
us 
to 
lose 
servicing 
income. 
In 
addition, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
indemnify 
the 
securitization 
trustee 
against 
losses 
from 
any 
failure 
by 
us, 
as 
a 
servicer 
or 
master 
servicer
, 
to 
perform 
our 
servicing 
obligations 
or 
any 
act 
or 
omission 
on 
our 
part 
that 
involves 
willful 
misfeasance, 
bad 
faith, 
or 
gross 
negligence. 
For 
certain 
investors 
and/or 
certain 
transactions, 
we 
may 
be 
contractually 
obligated 
to 
repurchase 
a 
mortgage 
loan 
or 
reimburse 
the 
investor 
for 
credit 
losses 
incurred 
on 
the 
loan 
as 
a 
remedy 
for 
servicing 
errors 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
loan. 
If 
we 
experience 
increased 
repurchase 
obligations 
because 
of 
claims 
that 
we 
did 
not 
satisfy 
our 
obligations 
as 
a 
servicer 
or 
master 
servicer
, 
or 
increased 
loss 
severity 
on 
such 
repurchases, 
we 
may 
have 
to 
materially 
increase 
our 
repurchase 
reserve.
W
e 
may 
incur 
costs 
if 
we 
are 
required 
to, 
or 
if 
we 
elect 
to, 
re-execute 
or 
re-file 
documents 
or 
take 
other 
action 
in 
our 
capacity 
as 
a 
servicer 
in 
connection 
with 
pending 
or 
completed 
foreclosures. 
W
e 
may 
incur 
litigation 
costs 
if 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
foreclosure 
action 
is 
challenged 
by 
a 
borrower
. 
If 
a 
court 
were 
to 
overturn 
a 
foreclosure 
because 
of 
errors 
or 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
foreclosure 
process, 
we 
may 
have 
liability 
to 
the 
borrower 
and/
or 
to 
any 
title 
insurer 
of 
the 
property 
sold 
in 
foreclosure 
if 
the 
required 
process 
was 
not 
followed. 
These 
costs 
and 
liabilities 
may 
not 
be 
legally 
or 
otherwise 
reimbursable 
to 
us, 
particularly 
to 
the 
extent 
they 
relate 
to 
securitized 
mortgage 
loans. 
In 
addition, 
if 
certain 
documents 
required 
for 
a 
foreclosure 
action 
are 
missing 
or 
defective, 
we 
could 
be 
obligated 
to 
cure 
the 
defect 
or 
repurchase 
the 
loan. 
W
e 
may 
incur 
a 
liability 
to 
securitization 
investors 
relating 
to 
delays 
or 
deficiencies 
in 
our 
processing 
of 
mortgage 
assignments 
or 
other 
documents 
necessary 
to 
comply 
with 
state 
law 
governing 
foreclosures. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
MSRs 
may 
be 
adversely 
af
fected 
to 
the 
extent 
our 
servicing 
costs 
increase 
because 
of 
higher 
foreclosure 
costs. 
Any 
of 
these 
actions 
may 
harm 
our 
reputation 
or 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
residential 
mortgage 
origination 
or

When 
we 
originate 
a 
mortgage 
loan, 
we 
do 
so 
with 
the 
expectation 
that 
if 
the 
borrower 
defaults, 
our 
ultimate 
loss 
is 
mitigated 
by 
the 
value 
of 
the 
collateral 
which 
secures 
the 
mortgage 
loan. 
Our 
ability 
to 
mitigate 
our 
losses 
on 
such 
defaulted 
loans 
depends 
upon 
our 
ability 
to 
promptly 
foreclose 
upon 
such 
collateral 
after 
an 
appropriate 
cure 
period. 
In 
some 
states, 
the 
lar
ge 
number 
of 
foreclosures 
which 
have 
occurred 
has 
resulted 
in 
delays 
in 
foreclosing. 
In 
some 
instances, 
our 
practices 
or 
failures 
to 
adhere 
to 
our 
policies 
have 
contributed 
to 
these 
delays. 
Any 
delay 
in 
the 
foreclosure 
process 
will 
adversely 
af
fect 
us 
by 
increasing 
our 
expenses 
related 
to 
carrying 
such 
assets, 
such 
as 
taxes, 
insurance, 
and 
other 
carrying 
costs, 
and 
exposes 
us 
to 
losses 
as 
a 
result 
of 
potential 
additional 
declines 
in 
the 
value 
of 
such 
collateral.
Our
 
earnings 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
volatility 
in 
mortgage 
pr
oduction 
and 
servicing 
r
evenues, 
and 
by 
changes 
in 
carrying 
values 
of 
our
 
MSRs 
and 
mortgages 
held 
for
 
sale 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
inter
est 
rates.
W
e 
earn 
revenue 
from 
fees 
we 
receive 
for 
originating 
mortgage 
loans 
and 
for 
servicing 
mortgage 
loans. 
When 
rates 
rise, 
the 
demand 
for 
mortgage 
loans 
usually 
tends 
to 
fall, 
reducing 
the 
revenue 
we 
receive 
from 
loan 
originations 
(mortgage 
production 
revenue).
Changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
can 
af
fect 
prepayment 
assumptions 
and 
thus 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
MSRs. 
An 
MSR 
is 
the 
right 
to 
service 
a 
mortgage 
loan-collect 
principal, 
interest 
and 
escrow 
amounts-for 
a 
fee. 
When 
interest 
rates 
fall, 
borrowers 
are 
usually 
more 
likely 
to 
prepay 
their 
mortgage 
loans 
by 
refinancing 
them 
at 
a 
lower 
rate. 
As 
the 
likelihood 
of 
prepayment 
increases, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
MSRs 
can 
decrease. 
Each 
quarter 
we 
evaluate 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
our 
MSRs 
and 
any 
related 
hedges, 
and 
any 
decrease 
in 
fair 
value 
reduces 
earnings 
in 
the 
period 
in 
which 
the 
decrease 
occurs.
Similarly
, 
we 
measure 
at 
fair 
value 
prime 
mortgages 
held 
for 
sale 
for 
which 
an 
active 
secondary 
market 
and 
readily 
available 
market 
prices 
exist. 
W
e 
also 
measure 
at 
fair 
value 
certain 
other 
interests 
we 
hold 
related 
to 
residential 
loan 
sales 
and 
securitizations. 
Similar 
to 
other 
interest-bearing 
securities, 
the 
value 
of 
these 
mortgages 
held 
for 
sale 
and 
other 
interests 
may 
be 
adversely 
af
fected 
by 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates. 
For 
example, 
if 
market 
interest 
rates 
increase 
relative 
to 
the 
yield 
on 
these 
mortgages 
held 
for 
sale 
and 
other 
interests, 
their 
fair 
value 
may 
fall. 
W
e 
may 
not 
hedge 
this 
risk, 
and 
even 
if 
we 
do 
hedge 
the 
risk 
with 
derivatives 
and 
other 
instruments, 
we 
may 
still 
incur 
significant 
losses 
from 
changes 
in 
the 
value 
of 
these 
mortgages 
held 
for 
sale 
and 
other 
interests 
or 
from 
changes 
in 
the 
value 
of 
the 
hedging 
instruments.

of 
changes

the

of 
the 
MSR,

. 
The 
hedge 
may 
not 
be 
ef

and 
may 
cause 
volatility
, 
or 
losses, 
in 
our

Also, 
we 
typically 
use 
derivatives 
and 
other 
instruments 
to

our

W

generally

of 
our

and 
we 
may 
not

any 
of 
the

Hedging 
is 
a 
complex 
process, 
requiring

models 
and 
constant 
monitoring.

Eurodollars 
that

being

W
e 
could 
incur 
significant 
losses 
from 
our 
hedging 
activities. 
There 
may 
be 
periods 
where 
we

to 
hedge 
mortgage

is 
our

Given 
our 
business 
mix, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
most 
of 
the 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
financial 
in 
nature, 
we 
tend 
to 
be 
sensitive 
to 
market 
interest 
rate 
movements 
and 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
financial 
markets. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
general 
economy
, 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
or 
in 
valuations 
in 
the 
debt 
or 
equity 
markets 
could 
directly 
impact 
us 
in 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
following 
ways:
Ł 
The 
yield 
on 
earning 
assets 
and 
rates 
paid 
on 
interest-
bearing 
liabilities 
may 
change 
in 
disproportionate 
ways;
Ł 
The 
value 
of 
certain 
balance 
sheet 
and 
of
f-balance 
sheet 
financial 
instruments 
that 
we 
hold 
could 
decline;
Ł 
The 
value 
of 
our 
pension 
plan 
assets 
could 
decline, 
thereby 
potentially 
requiring 
us 
to 
further 
fund 
the 
plan; 
or
Ł 
T
o 
the 
extent 
we 
access 
capital 
markets 
to 
raise 
funds 
to 
support 
our 
business, 
such 
changes 
could 
af
fect 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
funds 
or 
the 
ability 
to 
raise 
such 
funds.
Our 
net 
interest 
income 
is 
the 
interest 
we 
earn 
on 
loans, 
debt 
securities, 
and 
other 
assets 
we 
hold 
less 
the 
interest 
we 
pay 
on 
our 
deposits, 
long-term 
and 
short-term 
debt, 
and 
other 
liabilities. 
Net 
interest 
income 
is 
a 
function 
of 
both 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin-the 
dif
ference 
between 
the 
yield 
we 
earn 
on 
our 
assets 
and 
the 
interest 
rate 
we 
pay 
for 
deposits 
and 
our 
other 
sources 
of 
funding-and 
the 
amount 
of 
earning 
assets 
we 
hold. 
Changes 
in 
either 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
or 
the 
amount 
of 
earning 
assets 
we 
hold 
could 
af
fect 
our 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
13
our 
earnings. 
Changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
can 
af
fect 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin. 
Although 
the 
yield 
we 
earn 
on 
our 
assets 
and 
our 
funding 
costs 
tend 
to 
move 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
in 
response 
to 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates, 
one 
can 
rise 
or 
fall 
faster 
than 
the 
other
, 
causing 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
to 
expand 
or 
contract. 
When 
interest 
rates 
rise, 
our 
funding 
costs 
may 
rise 
faster 
than 
the 
yield 
we 
earn 
on 
our 
assets, 
causing 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
to 
contract 
until 
the 
asset 
yield 
catches 
up.
The 
amount 
and 
type 
of 
earning 
assets 
we 
hold 
can 
af
fect 
our 
yield 
and 
net 
interest 
mar
gin. 
W
e 
hold 
earning 
assets 
in 
the 
form 
of 
loans 
and 
investment 
securities, 
among 
other 
assets. 
As 
noted 
above, 
if 
economic 
conditions 
deteriorate, 
we 
may 
see 
lower 
demand 
for 
loans 
by 
creditworthy 
customers, 
reducing 
our 
yield. 
In 
addition, 
we 
may 
invest 
in 
lower 
yielding 
investment 
securities 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
reasons.
Changes 
in 
the 
slope 
of 
the 
ﬁyield 
curve,ﬂ 
or 
the 
spread 
between 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
interest 
rates, 
could 
also 
reduce 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin. 
Normally
, 
the 
yield 
curve 
is 
upward 
sloping, 
meaning 
short-term 
rates 
are 
lower 
than 
long-
term 
rates. 
The 
interest 
we 
earn 
on 
our 
assets 
and 
our 
costs 
to 
fund 
those 
assets 
may 
be 
af
fected 
by 
changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates, 
changes 
in 
the 
slope 
of 
the 
yield 
curve, 
and 
our 
cost 
of 
funding. 
This 
could 
lower 
our 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
and 
our 
net 
interest 
income.

of

changes 
and 
the

W
e 
hedge 
some 
of 
that

with

rate 
derivatives.
W
e 
may 
not 
hedge 
all 
of 
our 
interest 
rate 
risk. 
There 
is 
always 
the 
risk 
that 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
could 
reduce 
our 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
our 
earnings 
in 
material 
amounts, 
especially 
if 
actual 
conditions 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
materially 
dif
ferent 
than 
what 
we 
assumed. 
For 
example, 
if 
interest 
rates 
rise 
or 
fall 
faster 
than 
we 
assumed 
or 
the 
slope 
of 
the 
yield 
curve 
changes, 
we 
may 
incur 
significant 
losses 
on 
debt 
securities 
we 
hold 
as 
investments. 
T
o 
reduce 
our 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
we 
may 
rebalance 
our 
investment 
and 
loan 
portfolios, 
refinance 
our 
debt, 
and 
take 
other 
strategic 
actions. 
W

Disruptions 
in 
our
 
ability 
to 
access 
global 
capital 
markets 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our
 
capital 
r
esour
ces 
and 
liquidity
.
In 
managing 
our 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheet, 
we 
depend 
on 
access 
to 
global 
capital 
markets 
to 
provide 
us 
with 
suf
ficient 
capital 
resources 
and 
liquidity 
to 
meet 
our 
commitments 
and 
business 
needs, 
and 
to 
accommodate 
the 
transaction 
and 
cash 
management 
needs 
of 
our 
clients. 
Other 
sources 
of 
contingent 
funding 
available 
to 
us 
include 
inter
-bank 
borrowings, 
repurchase 
agreements, 
FHLB 
capacity
, 
and 
borrowings 
from 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
discount 
window
. 
Any 
occurrence 
that 
may 
limit 
our 
access 
to 
the 
capital 
markets, 
such 
as 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
confidence 
of 
debt 
investors, 
our 
depositors 
or 
counterparties 
participating 
in 
the 
capital 
markets, 
or 
a 
downgrade 
of 
our 
debt 
rating, 
may 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
funding 
costs 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
raise 
funding 
and, 
in 
turn, 
our 
liquidity
.
The 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
policies 
of 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
its 
agencies 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our
 
earnings.
The 
Federal 
Reserve 
regulates 
the 
supply 
of 
money 
and 
credit 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Its 
policies 
determine 
in 
lar
ge 
part 
the 
cost 
of 
funds 
for 
lending 
and 
investing 
and 
the 
return 
earned 
on 
those 
loans 
and 
investments, 
both 
of 
which 
af
fect 
the 
net 
interest 
mar
gin. 
They 
can 
also 
materially 
decrease 
the 
value 
of 
financial 
assets 
we 
hold, 
such 
as 
debt 
securities 
and 
MSRs. 
Federal 
Reserve 
policies 
can 
also 
adversely 
af
fect 
borrowers, 
potentially 
increasing 
the 
risk 
that 
they 
may 
fail 
to 
repay 
their 
loans, 
or 
could 
adversely 
create 
asset 
bubbles 
which 
result 
from 
prolonged 
periods 
of 
accommodative 
policy
, 
and 
which 
in 
turn 
result 
in 
volatile 
markets 
and 
rapidly 
declining 
collateral 
values. 
Changes 
in 
Federal 
Reserve 
policies 
are 
beyond 
our 
control 
and 
dif
ficult 
to 
predict; 
consequently
, 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
changes 
on 
our 
activities 
and 
results 
of 
operations 
is 
dif
ficult 
to 
predict. 
Also, 
potential 
new 
taxes 
on 
corporations 
generally
, 
or 
on 
financial 
institutions 
specifically
, 
would 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
net 
income.
Clients 
could 
pursue 
alternatives 
to 
bank 
deposits, 
causing 
us 
to 
lose 
a 
r
elatively 
inexpensive 
sour
ce 
of 
funding.
Checking 
and 
savings 
account 
balances 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
client 
deposits 
could 
decrease 
if 
clients 
perceive 
alternative 
investments 
as 
providing 
superior 
expected 
returns. 
When 
clients 
move 
money 
out 
of 
bank 
deposits 
in 
favor 
of 
alternative 
investments, 
we 
can 
lose 
a 
relatively 
inexpensive 
source 
of 
funds, 
increasing 
our 
funding 
costs.
Consumers 
may 
decide 
not 
to 
use 
banks 
to 
complete 
their
 
financial 
transactions, 
which 
could 
affect 
net 
income.
T
echnology 
and 
other 
changes 
now 
allow 
parties 
to 
complete 
financial 
transactions 
without 
banks. 
For 
example, 
consumers 
can 
pay 
bills 
and 
transfer 
funds 
directly 
without 
banks. 
This 
process 
could 
result 
in 
the 
loss 
of 
fee 
income, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
loss 
of 
client 
deposits 
and 
the 
income 
generated 
from 
those 
deposits.

Recently
, 
we 
have 
seen 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
frequency 
and 
sophistication 
of 
fraudulent 
activity
. 
Criminals 
committing 
fraud 
increasingly 
are 
using 
more 
sophisticated 
techniques 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
are 
part 
of 
lar
ger 
criminal 
rings 
which 
allows 
them 
to 
be 
more 
ef
fective.
The 
fraudulent 
activity 
has 
taken 
many 
forms, 
ranging 
from 
check 
fraud, 
mechanical 
devices 
attached 
to 
A
TM 
machines, 
social 
engineering 
and 
phishing 
attacks 
to 
obtain 
personal 
information. 
Further
, 
in 
addition 
to 
fraud 
committed 
against 
us, 
we 
may 
suf
fer 
losses 
as 
a 
result 
of 
fraudulent 
activity 
committed 
against 
third 
parties. 
For 
example, 
in 
2014 
several 
national 
retail 
merchants 
suf
fered 
data 
compromises 
involving 
the 
personal 
and 
payment 
card 
information 
of 
SunT
rust 
customers. 
The 
perpetrators 
of 
this 
fraud 
executed 
unauthorized 
char
ges 
against 
SunT
rust 
account 
holders 
which 
we 
were 
required 
to 
reimburse. 
While 
we 
may 
be 
entitled 
to 
full 
or 
partial 
indemnification 
from 
such 
merchants 
for 
their 
failure 
to 
protect 
our 
client™
s 
personal 
data, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
we 
will 
receive 
such 
indemnification, 
that 
it 
will 
be 
adequate, 
or 
that 
it 
will 
cover 
other 
losses 
such 
as 
lost 
profits 
or 
costs 
to 
reissue 
payment 
cards. 
Further
, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
increased 
fraud 
activity
, 
we 
have 
increased 
our 
spending 
on 
systems 
to 
detect 
and 
prevent 
fraud, 
and 
may 
need 
to 
make 
further

As 
client, 
public, 
and 
regulatory 
expectations 
regarding 
operational 
and 
information 
security 
have 
increased, 
our 
operational 
systems 
and 
infrastructure 
must 
continue 
to 
be 
safeguarded 
and 
monitored 
for 
potential 
failures, 
disruptions, 
and 
breakdowns. 
Our 
business, 
financial, 
accounting, 
data 
processing, 
or 
other 
operating 
systems 
and 
facilities 
may 
stop 
operating 
properly 
or 
become 
disabled 
or

as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
including 
events 
that 
are 
wholly 
or 
partially 
beyond 
our 
control. 
For 
example, 
there 
could 
be 
sudden 
increases 
in 
client 
transaction 
volume; 
electrical 
or 
telecommunications 
outages; 
natural 
disasters 
such 
as

disease 
pandemics; 
events 
arising 
from 
local

scale 
political 
or 
social 
matters, 
including 
terrorist 
acts; 
and, 
as 
described 
below
, 
cyber

Although 
we 
have 
business 
continuity 
plans 
and 
other 
safeguards 
in

our

operations 
may 
be 
adversely

by 
significant 
and 
widespread

that 
support 
our

and 
clients.
Information 
security 
risks 
for 
lar
ge 
financial 
institutions 
such 
as 
ours 
have 
generally 
increased 
in 
recent 
years 
in 
part 
because 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
new 
technologies, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
internet 
and 
telecommunications 
technologies 
to 
conduct 
financial

and 
the 
increased 
sophistication 
and 
activities 
of 
or
ganized 
crime, 
hackers, 
terrorists, 
activists, 
and 
other 
external 
parties. 
As 
noted 
above, 
our

rely 
on 
the 
secure 
processing, 
transmission,

of 
confidential

to 
conduct 
their 
operations. 
In

Although 
we

our

and 
our

may 
become 
the

discover 
and 
exploit 
vulnerabilities 
that 
may

or 
may 
not, 
be 
generally 
known. 
In 
2014 
several 
vulnerabilities 
in 
core 
Internet 
security 
technologies 
were 
announced 
and 
widely 
publicized 
in 
the 
media.€
These 
vulnerabilities 
increased 
the 
potential 
of 
loss 
or 
compromise 
for 
users 
of 
the 
Internet 
until 
specific 
actions 
were 
taken 
by 
the

outside

Our

remains 
heightened 
because 
of, 
among 
other

the

our 
expanded 
geographic 
footprint, 
the 
outsourcing 
of 
some 
of 
our 
business 
operations, 
and 
the 
continued 
uncertain 
global 
economic 
environment. 
As 
a 
result, 
cybersecurity 
and 
the 
continued 
development 
and 
enhancement 
of 
our 
controls, 
processes, 
and 
practices 
designed 
to 
protect 
our 
systems, 
computers, 
software, 
data 
and 
networks 
from 
attack, 
damage, 
or 
unauthorized 
access 
remain 
a 
focus 
for 
us. 
As 
threats 
continue 
to 
evolve, 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
expend 
additional 
resources 
to 
continue 
to 
modify 
or 
enhance 
our 
protective 
measures 
or 
to 
investigate 
and 
remediate 
information 
security 
vulnerabilities.
As 
a 
necessary 
aspect 
of 
operating 
our 
business 
we 
must 
provide 
access 
to 
customer 
and 
sensitive 
company 
information 
to 
our 
employees, 
contractors, 
consultants, 
third 
parties 
and 
other 
authorized 
entities. 
Controls 
and 
oversight 
mechanisms 
are 
in 
place 
to 
limit 
access 
to 
this 
information 
and 
protect 
it 
from 
unauthorized 
disclosure 
or 
theft.€Control 
systems 
and 
policies 
pertaining 
to 
system 
access 
are 
subject 
to 
errors 
in 
design, 
oversight 
failure, 
software 
failure, 
intentional 
subversion 
or 
other 
compromise 
resulting 
in 
theft, 
error
, 
loss 
or 
inappropriate 
use 
of 
information 
or 
systems 
to 
commit 
fraud, 
cause 
embarrassment 
to 
the 
company 
or 
its 
executives 
or 
to 
gain 
competitive 
advantage.
Additionally
, 
the 
FRB, 
the 
CFPB, 
and 
other 
regulators 
expect 
financial 
institutions 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
their 
performance, 
including 
aspects 
which 
they 
delegate 
to 
third 
parties. 
Disruptions 
or 
failures 
in 
the 
physical 
infrastructure 
or 
operating 
systems 
that 
support 
our 
businesses 
and 
clients, 
or 
cyber
-attacks 
or 
security 
breaches 
of 
the 
networks, 
systems, 
devices, 
or 
software 
that 
our 
clients 
use 
to 
access 
our 
products 
and 
services 
could 
result 
in 
client 
attrition, 
regulatory 
fines, 
penalties 
or 
intervention, 
reputational 
damage, 
reimbursement 
or 
other 
compensation 
costs, 
and/or 
additional 
compliance 
costs, 
any 
of 
which 
could 
materially 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
financial 
condition.
The 
soundness 
of 
other
 
financial 
institutions 
could 
adversely 
affect 
us.
Our 
ability 
to 
engage 
in 
routine 
funding 
transactions 
could 
be 
adversely 
af
fected 
by 
the 
actions 
and 
commercial 
soundness 
of 
other 
financial 
institutions. 
Financial 
services 
institutions 
are 
interrelated 
as 
a 
result 
of 
trading, 
clearing, 
counterparty
, 
or 
other 
relationships. 
W
e 
have 
exposure 
to 
many 
dif
ferent 
industries 
and 
counterparties, 
and 
we 
routinely 
execute 
transactions 
with 
counterparties 
in 
the 
financial 
industry
, 
including 
brokers 
and 
dealers, 
commercial 
banks, 
investment 
banks, 
mutual 
and 
hedge 
funds, 
and 
other 
institutional 
clients. 
As 
a 
result, 
defaults 
by
, 
or 
even 
rumors 
or 
questions 
about, 
one 
or 
more 
financial 
services 
institution, 
or 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
generally
, 
in 
the 
past 
have 
led 
to 
market-wide 
liquidity 
problems 
and 
could 
lead 
to 
losses 
or 
defaults 
by 
us 
or 
by 
other 
institutions. 
Many 
of 
these 
transactions 
expose 
us 
to 
credit 
risk 
in 
the 
event 
of 
default 
of 
our 
counterparty 
or 
client. 
In 
addition, 
our 
credit 
risk 
may 
be 
exacerbated 
when 
the 
collateral 
held 
by 
us 
cannot 
be 
realized 
or 
is 
liquidated 
at 
prices 
not 
suf
ficient 
to 
recover 
the 
full 
amount 
of 
the 
financial 
instrument 
exposure 
due 
us. 
There 
is 
no 
assurance 
that 
any 
such 
losses 
would 
not 
materially 
and 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
results 
of 
operations.
W
e 
depend 
on 
the 
accuracy 
and 
completeness 
of 
information 
about 
clients 
and 
counterparties.
In 
deciding 
whether 
to 
extend 
credit 
or 
enter 
into 
other 
transactions 
with 
clients 
and 
counterparties, 
we 
may 
rely 
on 
information 
furnished 
by 
or 
on 
behalf 
of 
clients 
and 
counterparties, 
including 
financial 
statements 
and 
other 
financial 
information. 
W
e 
also 
may 
rely 
on 
representations 
of 
clients 
and 
counterparties 
as 
to 
the 
accuracy 
and 
completeness 
of 
that 
information 
and, 
with 
respect 
to 
financial 
statements, 
on 
reports 
of 
independent 
auditors.
Competition 
in 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
is 
intense 
and 
we 
could 
lose 
business 
or
 
suffer
 
margin 
declines 
as 
a 
r
esult.
W
e 
operate 
in 
a 
highly 
competitive 
industry 
that 
could 
become 
even 
more 
competitive 
as 
a 
result 
of 
reform 
of 
the 
financial 
services 
industry 
resulting 
from 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
and 
other 
legislative, 
regulatory
, 
and 
technological 
changes, 
and 
from 
continued 
consolidation. 
W
e 
face 
aggressive 
competition 
from 
other 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
lending 
institutions 
and 
from 
numerous 
other 
providers 
of 
financial 
services. 
The 
ability 
of 
nonbanking 
financial 
institutions 
to 
provide 
services 
previously 
limited 
to 
commercial 
banks 
has 
intensified 
competition. 
Because 
nonbanking 
financial 
institutions 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
regulatory 
restrictions 
as 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
companies, 
they 
can 
often 
operate 
with 
greater 
flexibility 
and 
lower 
cost 
structures. 
Securities 
firms 
and 
insurance 
companies 
that 
elect 
to 
become 
financial 
holding 
companies 
can 
of
fer 
virtually 
any 
type 
of 
financial 
service, 
including 
banking, 
securities 
underwriting, 
insurance 
(both 
agency 
and 
underwriting) 
and 
merchant 
banking, 
and 
may 
acquire 
banks 
and 
other 
financial 
institutions. 
This 
may 
significantly 
change 
the 
competitive 
environment 
in 
which 
we 
conduct 
business. 
Some 
of 
our 
competitors 
have 
greater 
financial 
resources 
and/
or 
face 
fewer 
regulatory 
constraints. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
various 
sources 
of 
competition, 
we 
could 
lose 
business 
to 
competitors 
or 
be 
forced 
to 
price 
products 
and 
services 
on 
less 
advantageous 
terms 
to 
retain 
or 
attract 
clients, 
either 
of 
which 
would 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
profitability
.
Maintaining 
or
 
incr
easing 
market 
shar
e 
depends 
on 
market 
acceptance 
and 
r
egulatory 
appr
oval 
of 
new 
pr
oducts 
and 
services.
Our 
success 
depends, 
in 
part, 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
adapt 
16
products 
and 
services 
to 
evolving 
industry 
standards. 
There 
is 
increasing 
pressure 
to 
provide 
products 
and 
services 
at 
lower 
prices. 
This 
can 
reduce 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
noninterest 
income 
from 
fee-based 
products 
and 
services. 
In 
addition, 
the 
widespread 
adoption 
of 
new 
technologies 
could 
require 
us 
to 
make 
substantial 
capital 
expenditures 
to 
modify 
or 
adapt 
existing 
products 
and 
services 
or 
develop 
new 
products 
and 
services. 
W
e 
may 
not 
be 
successful 
in 
introducing 
new 
products 
and 
services 
in 
response 
to 
industry 
trends 
or 
developments 
in 
technology
, 
or 
those 
new 
products 
may 
not 
achieve 
market 
acceptance. 
As 
a 
result, 
we 
could 
lose 
business, 
be 
forced 
to 
price 
products 
and 
services 
on 
less 
advantageous 
terms 
to 
retain 
or 
attract 
clients, 
or 
be 
subject 
to 
cost 
increases, 
any 
of 
which 
would 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
profitability
.
W
e 
might 
not 
pay 
dividends 
on 
our
 
stock.
Holders 
of 
our 
stock 
are 
only 
entitled 
to 
receive 
such 
dividends 
as 
our 
Board 
may 
declare 
out 
of 
funds 
legally 
available 
for 
such 
payments. 
Although 
we 
have 
historically 
declared 
cash 
dividends 
on 
our 
stock, 
we 
are 
not 
required 
to 
do 
so.
Further
, 
in 
February 
2009, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
required 
bank 
holding 
companies 
to 
substantially 
reduce 
or 
eliminate 
dividends. 
Since 
that 
time, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
has 
indicated 
that 
increased 
capital 
distributions 
would 
generally 
not 
be 
considered 
prudent 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
well-developed 
capital 
plan 
and 
a 
capital 
position 
that 
would 
remain 
strong 
even 
under 
adverse 
conditions. 
As 
a 
result, 
any 
increase 
in 
our 
dividend 
will 
require 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve. 
Refer 
to 
the 
discussion 
under 
the 
caption 
ﬁW
e 
are 
subject 
to 
capital 
adequacy 
and 
liquidity 
guidelines 
and, 
if 
we 
fail 
to 
meet 
these 
guidelines, 
our 
financial 
condition 
would 
be 
adversely 
af
fected,ﬂ 
above.
Additionally
, 
our 
obligations 
under 
the 
warrant 
agreements 
that 
we 
entered 
into 
with 
the 
U.S. 
T
reasury 
as 
part 
of 
the 
CPP
 
will 
increase 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
we 
pay 
dividends 
on 
our 
common 
stock 
prior 
to 
December 
31, 
2018 
exceeding 
$0.54 
per 
share 
per 
quarter
, 
which 
was 
the 
amount 
of 
dividends 
we 
paid 
when 
we 
first 
participated 
in 
the 
CPP
. 
Specifically
, 
the 
exercise 
price 
and 
the 
number 
of 
shares 
to 
be 
issued 
upon 
exercise 
of 
the 
warrants 
will 
be 
adjusted 
proportionately 
(that 
is, 
adversely 
to 
us) 
as 
specified 
in 
a 
formula 
contained 
in 
the 
warrant 
agreements.
Our
 
ability 
to 
r
eceive 
dividends 
fr
om 
our
 
subsidiaries 
could 
affect 
our
 
liquidity 
and 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends.
W
e

a 
separate 
and 
distinct 
legal 
entity

our 
subsidiaries, 
including 
the 
Bank. 
W
e 
receive 
substantially 
all 
of 
our 
revenue 
from 
dividends 
from 
our 
subsidiaries. 
These 
dividends 
are 
the 
principal 
source 
of 
funds 
to 
pay 
dividends 
on 
our 
common 
stock 
and 
interest 
and 
principal 
on 
our 
debt. 
V
arious 
federal 
and/or 
state 
laws 
and 
regulations 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
dividends 
that 
our 
Bank 
and 
certain 
of 
our 
nonbank 
subsidiaries 
may 
pay 
us. 
Also, 
our 
right 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
distribution 
of 
assets 
upon 
a 
subsidiary's 
liquidation 
or 
reor
ganization 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
prior 
claims 
of 
the 
subsidiary's 
creditors. 
Limitations 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
receive 
dividends 
from 
our 
subsidiaries 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
ef
fect 
on 
our 
liquidity 
and 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
pay 
dividends 
on 
common 
stock. 
Additionally
, 
if 
our 
subsidiaries' 
earnings 
are 
not 
suf
ficient 
to 
make 
dividend 
payments 
to 
us 
while 
maintaining 
adequate 
capital 
levels, 
we 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
make 
dividend 
payments 
to 
our 
common 
stockholders.
Any 
r
eduction 
in 
our
 
cr
edit 
rating 
could 
incr
ease 
the 
cost 
of 
our
 
funding 
fr
om 
the 
capital 
markets.
The 
rating 
agencies 
regularly 
evaluate 
us, 
and 
their 
ratings 
are 
based 
on 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
our 
financial

as 
factors 
not 
entirely 
within 
our 
control, 
including 
conditions 
af
fecting 
the 
financial 
services

generally
. 
Our 
failure 
to 
maintain 
those 
ratings 
could 
adversely 
af
fect 
the 
cost 
and 
other 
terms 
upon 
which 
we 
are 
able 
to 
obtain 
funding 
and 
increase 
our 
cost 
of 
capital. 
Credit 
ratings 
are 
one 
of 
numerous 
factors 
that 
influence 
our 
funding 
costs. 
Among 
our 
various 
retail 
and 
wholesale 
funding 
sources, 
credit 
ratings 
have 
a 
more 
direct 
impact 
on 
the 
cost 
of 
wholesale 
funding, 
as 
our 
primary

of

is 
bank 
deposits, 
most

W

seek 
acquisitions 
in 
the 
future. 
W
e 
may 
not

appropriate

terms,

proposed 
acquisitions, 
successfully 
integrate 
acquired 
businesses 
into 
the 
existing 
operations, 
or 
expand 
into 
new 
markets. 
Once 
integrated, 
acquired 
operations 
may 
not 
achieve 
levels 
of 
revenues, 
profitability
, 
or 
productivity 
comparable 
with 
those 
achieved 
by 
our 
existing 
operations, 
or 
otherwise 
perform 
as 
expected.
Acquisitions 
involve 
numerous 
risks, 
including 
dif
ficulties 
in 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
operations, 
technologies, 
services, 
and 
products 
of 
the 
acquired 
companies, 
and 
the 
diversion 
of 
management's 
attention 
from 
other 
business 
concerns. 
W
e 
may 
not 
properly 
ascertain 
all 
such 
risks 
prior 
to 
an 
acquisition 
or 
prior 
to 
such 
a 
risk 
impacting 
us 
while 
integrating 
an 
acquired 
company
. 
As 
a 
result, 
dif
ficulties 
encountered 
with 
acquisitions 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
ef
fect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
and 
results 
of 
operations.
Furthermore, 
we 
must 
generally 
receive 
federal 
regulatory 
approval 
before 
we 
can 
acquire 
a 
bank 
or 
BHC
. 
In 
determining 
whether 
to 
approve 
a 
proposed 
bank 
acquisition, 
federal 
bank 
regulators 
will 
consider
, 
among 
other 
factors, 
the 
ef
fect 
of 
the 
acquisition 
on 
competition, 
financial 
condition, 
future 
prospects, 
including 
current 
and 
projected 
capital 
levels, 
the 
competence, 
experience, 
and 
integrity 
of 
management, 
compliance 
with 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
the 
convenience 
and 
needs 
of 
the 
communities 
to 
be 
served, 
including 
the 
acquiring 
institution's 
record 
of 
compliance 
under 
the 
CRA
, 
and 
the 
ef
fectiveness 
of 
the 
acquiring 
institution 
in 
combating 
money 
laundering 
activities. 
In 
addition, 
we 
cannot 
be 
certain 
when 
or 
if, 
or 
on 
what 
terms 
and 
conditions, 
any 
required 
regulatory 
approvals 
will 
be 
granted. 
Consequently
, 
we 
might 
be 
required 
to 
sell 
portions 
of 
the 
acquired 
institution 
as 
a 
condition 
to 
receiving 
regulatory 
approval 
or 
we 
may 
not 
obtain 
regulatory 
approval 
for 
a 
proposed 
acquisition 
on 
acceptable 
terms 
or 
at 
all, 
in 
which 
case 
we 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
complete 
the 
17
acquisition 
despite 
the 
time 
and 
expenses 
invested 
in 
pursuing 
it.
Additionally
, 
our 
regulatory 
requirements 
increase 
as 
our 
size 
increases. 
W
e 
become 
subject 
to 
enhanced 
capital 
and 
liquidity 
requirements 
once 
our 
assets 
exceed 
$250 
billion, 
and 
our 
regulators 
likely 
would 
expect 
us 
to 
begin 
voluntarily 
complying 
with 
those 
requirements 
as 
we 
approach 
that 
size.
W
e 
ar

and 
our
 
expenses 
r
elated 
to 
this 
litigation 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our
 
r
esults.
From 
time 
to 
time 
we 
are 
subject 
to 
litigation 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
business. 
These 
claims 
and 
legal 
actions, 
including 
supervisory 
actions 
by 
our 
regulators, 
could 
involve 
lar
ge 
monetary 
claims 
and 
significant 
defense 
costs. 
During 
the 
recent 
credit 
crisis, 
we 
have 
seen 
both 
the 
number 
of 
cases 
and 
our 
expenses 
related 
to 
those 
cases 
increase. 
The 
outcome 
of 
these 
cases 
is 
uncertain.
W
e 
establish 
reserves 
for 
legal 
claims 
when 
payments 
associated 
with 
the 
claims 
become 
probable 
and 
the 
costs 
can 
be 
reasonably 
estimated. 
W
e 
may 
still 
incur 
legal 
costs 
for 
a 
matter 
even 
if 
we 
have 
not 
established 
a 
reserve. 
In 
addition, 
the 
actual 
cost 
of 
resolving 
a 
legal 
claim 
may 
be 
substantially 
higher 
than 
any 
amounts 
reserved 
for 
that 
matter
. 
The 
ultimate 
resolution 
of 
a 
pending 
legal 
proceeding, 
depending 
on 
the 
remedy 
sought 
and 
granted, 
could 
materially 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
condition.
Substantial 
legal 
liability 
or 
significant 
regulatory 
action 
against 
us 
could 
have 
material 
adverse 
financial 
ef
fects 
or 
cause 
significant 
reputational 
harm 
to 
us, 
which 
in 
turn 
could 
seriously 
harm 
our 
business 
prospects. 
W
e 
may 
be 
exposed 
to 
substantial 
uninsured 
liabilities, 
which 
could 
adversely 
af
fect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
condition.

W
e 
may 
incur
 
fines, 
penalties 
and 
other
 
negative 
consequences 
fr
om 
r
egulatory 
violations, 
possibly 
even 
inadvertent 
or
 
unintentional 
violations.
W
e 
maintain 
systems 
and 
procedures 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
we 
comply 
with 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
but 
there 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
these 
will 
be 
ef
fective. 
In 
addition 
to 
fines 
and 
penalties, 
we 
may 
suf
fer 
other 
negative 
consequences 
from 
regulatory 
violations 
including 
restrictions 
on 
certain 
activities, 
such 
as 
our 
mortgage 
business, 
which 
may 
af
fect 
our 
relationship 
with 
the 
GSEs 
and 
may 
also 
damage 
our 
reputation, 
and 
this 
in 
turn 
might 
materially 
af
fect 
our 
business 
and 
results 
of 
operations.
For 
example, 
on 
October 
10, 
2013, 
we 
announced 
that 
we 
reached 
agreements 
in 
principle 
with 
the 
HUD 
and 
the 
U.S. 
DOJ 
to 
settle 
(i) 
certain 
civil 
and 
administrative 
claims 
arising 
from 
FHA-insured 
mortgage 
loans 
originated 
by 
STM 
from 
January 
1, 
2006 
through 
March 
31, 
2012 
and 
(ii) 
certain 
alleged 
civil 
claims 
regarding 
our 
mortgage 
servicing 
and 
origination 
practices 
as 
part 
of 
the 
National 
Mortgage 
Servicing 
Settlement. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
combined 
settlement, 
we 
agreed 
to 
pay 
$468 
million. 
In 
addition, 
we 
agreed 
to 
provide 
$500 
million 
of 
consumer 
relief 
and 
to 
implement 
certain 
mortgage 
servicing 
standards.
Further
, 
some 
legal/regulatory 
frameworks 
provide 
for 
the 
imposition 
of 
fines 
or 
penalties 
for 
noncompliance 
even 
though 
the 
noncompliance 
was 
inadvertent 
or 
unintentional 
and 
even 
though 
there 
were 
in 
place 
at 
the 
time 
systems 
and 
procedures 
designed 
to 
ensure 
compliance. 
For 
example, 
we 
are 
subject 
to 
regulations 
issued 
by 
the 
OF
AC
 
that 
prohibit 
financial 
institutions 
from 
participating 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
property 
belonging 
to 
the 
governments 
of 
certain 
foreign 
countries 
and 
designated 
nationals 
of 
those 
countries. 
OF
AC
 
may 
impose 
penalties 
for 
inadvertent 
or 
unintentional 
violations 
even 
if 
reasonable 
processes 
are 
in 
place 
to 
prevent 
the 
violations. 
Additionally
, 
federal 
regulators 
have 
begun 
pursuing 
financial 
institutions 
with 
emer
ging 
theories 
of 
recovery 
under 
the 
Financial 
Institutions 
Reform, 
Recovery
, 
and 
Enforcement 
Act 
of 
1989 
(FIRREA). 
Courts 
may 
uphold 
significant 
additional 
penalties 
on 
financial 
institutions, 
even 
where 
the 
financial 
institution 
had 
already 
reimbursed 
the 
government 
or 
other 
counterparties 
for 
actual 
losses.
W
e 
depend 
on 
the 
expertise 
of 
key 
personnel. 
If 
these 
individuals 
leave 
or
 
change 
their
 
r
oles 
without 
effective 
r
eplacements, 
operations 
may 
suffer
.
Our 
success 
depends, 
to 
a 
lar
ge 
degree, 
on 
the 
continued 
services 
of 
executive 
of
ficers, 
especially 
our 
Chairman 
and 
CEO
, 
W
illiam 
H. 
Rogers, 
Jr
., 
and 
other 
key 
personnel 
who 
have 
extensive 
experience 
in 
the 
industry
. 
W
e 
generally 
do 
not 
carry 
key 
person 
life 
insurance 
on 
any 
of 
the 
executive 
of
ficers 
or 
other 
key 
personnel. 
If 
we 
lose 
the 
services 
of 
any 
of 
these 
integral 
personnel 
and 
fail 
to 
manage 
a 
smooth 
transition 
to 
new 
personnel, 
the 
business 
could 
be 
adversely 
impacted.
W
e 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
hir
e 
or
 
r
etain 
additional 
qualified 
personnel 
and 
r
ecruiting 
and 
compensation 
costs 
may 
incr
ease 
as 
a 
r
esult 
of 
turnover
, 
both 
of 
which 
may 
incr
ease 
costs 
and 
r
educe 
pr
ofitability 
and 
may 
adversely 
impact 
our
 
ability 
to 
implement 
our
 
business 
strategies.
Our 
success 
depends 
upon 
the 
ability 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
highly 
motivated, 
well-qualified 
personnel. 
W
e 
face 
significant 
competition 
in 
the 
recruitment 
of 
qualified 
employees. 
Our 
ability 
to 
execute 
our 
business 
strategy 
and 
provide 
high 
quality 
service 
may 
suf
fer 
if 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
recruit 
or 
retain 
a 
suf
ficient 
number 
of 
qualified 
employees 
or 
if 
the 
costs 
of 
employee 
compensation 
or 
benefits 
increase 
substantially
. 
Further
, 
in 
June 
2010, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
other 
federal 
banking 
regulators 
jointly 
issued 
comprehensive 
final 
guidance 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
incentive 
compensation 
policies 
do 
not 
undermine 
the 
safety 
and 
soundness 
of 
banking 
or
ganizations 
by 
encouraging 
employees 
to 
take 
imprudent 
risks. 
This 
regulation 
significantly 
restricts 
the 
amount, 
form, 
and 
context 
in 
which 
we 
pay 
incentive 
compensation.
Our
 
accounting 
policies 
and 
pr
ocesses 
ar
e 
critical 
to 
how 
we 
r
eport 
our
 
financial 
condition 
and 
r
esults 
of 
operations. 
They 
r
equir
e 
management 
to 
make 
estimates 
about 
matters 
that 
ar
e 
uncertain.
Accounting 
policies 
and 
processes 
are 
fundamental 
to 
how 
we 
record 
and 
report 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. 
Some 
of 
these 
policies 
require 
use 
of 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
may 
af
fect 
the 
value 
of 
our 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
18
and 
financial 
results. 
Several 
of 
our 
accounting 
policies 
are 
critical 
because 
they 
require 
management 
to 
make 
dif
ficult, 
subjective, 
and 
complex 
judgments 
about 
matters 
that 
are 
inherently 
uncertain 
and 
because 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
materially 
dif
ferent 
amounts 
would 
be 
reported 
under 
dif
ferent 
conditions 
or 
using 
dif
ferent 
assumptions. 
Pursuant 
to 
U.S. 
GAAP
, 
we 
are 
required 
to 
make 
certain 
assumptions 
and 
estimates 
in 
preparing 
our 
financial 
statements, 
including 
in 
determining 
credit 
loss 
reserves, 
reserves 
related 
to 
litigation 
and 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
certain 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
including 
the 
value 
of 
goodwill, 
among 
other 
items. 
If 
assumptions 
or 
estimates 
underlying 
our 
financial 
statements 
are 
incorrect, 
or 
are 
adjusted 
periodically
, 
we 
may 
experience 
material 
losses.
Management 
has 
identified 
certain 
accounting 
policies 
as 
being 
critical 
because 
they 
require 
management's 
judgment 
to 
ascertain 
the 
valuations 
of 
assets, 
liabilities, 
commitments, 
and 
contingencies. 
A
 
variety 
of 
factors 
could 
af
fect 
the 
ultimate 
value 
that 
is 
obtained 
either 
when 
earning 
income, 
recognizing 
an 
expense, 
recovering 
an 
asset, 
valuing 
an 
asset 
or 
liability
, 
or 
recognizing 
or 
reducing 
a 
liability
. 
W
e 
have 
established 
detailed 
policies 
and 
control 
procedures 
that 
are 
intended 
to 
ensure 
these 
critical 
accounting 
estimates 
and 
judgments 
are 
well 
controlled 
and 
applied 
consistently
. 
In 
addition, 
the 
policies 
and 
procedures 
are 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
process 
for 
changing 
methodologies 
occurs 
in 
an 
appropriate 
manner
. 
Because 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
surrounding 
our 
judgments 
and 
the 
estimates 
pertaining 
to 
these 
matters, 
we 
cannot 
guarantee 
that 
we 
will 
not 
be 
required 
to 
adjust 
accounting 
policies 
or 
restate 
prior 
period 
financial 
statements.

Further
, 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
the 
F
ASB
 
and 
SEC 
change 
the 
financial 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
standards 
that 
govern 
the 
preparation 
of 
our 
financial 
statements. 
In 
addition, 
accounting 
standard 
setters 
and 
those 
who 
interpret 
the 
accounting 
standards 
(such 
as 
the 
F
ASB
, 
SEC, 
banking 
regulators 
and 
our 
outside 
auditors) 
may 
change 
or 
even 
reverse 
their 
previous 
interpretations 
or 
positions 
on 
how 
these 
standards 
should 
be 
applied. 
Changes 
in 
financial 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
standards 
and 
changes 
in 
current 
interpretations 
may 
be 
beyond 
our 
control, 
can 
be 
hard 
to 
predict 
and 
could 
materially 
af
fect 
how 
we 
report 
our 
financial 
results 
and 
condition. 
In 
some 
cases, 
we 
could 
be 
required 
to 
apply 
a 
new 
or 
revised 
standard 
retroactively
, 
resulting 
in 
us 
restating 
prior 
period 
financial 
statements.
Our
 
financial 
instruments 
carried 
at 
fair
 
value 
expose 
us 
to 
certain 
market 
risks.
W
e

assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
derivatives, 
which 
include 
various 
types 
of 
instruments 
and 
maturities. 
Additionally
, 
we 
elected 
to 
record 
selected 
fixed-rate 
debt, 
mortgage 
loans, 
MSRs 
and 
other 
financial 
instruments 
at 
fair 
value. 
Changes 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
financial 
instruments 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
are 
recognized 
in 
earnings. 
The 
financial 
instruments 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
are 
exposed 
to 
market 
risks 
related 
to 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates, 
market 
liquidity
, 
and 
our 
market-based 
credit

as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
risk 
of

by 
specific

W

the 
market 
risks 
associated 
with 
these

through

hedging 
arrangements 
or 
broader 
ALM

Changes 
in 
the

could 
have 
a

adverse 
impact 
on

Our

are 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that

to 
be 
disclosed 
by 
us 
in

we

the

and 
reported 
within 
the 
time

specified 
in 
the 
SEC's

W
e 
believe 
that 
any 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
or 
internal 
controls 
and 
procedures, 
no 
matter 
how 
well 
conceived 
and 
operated, 
can 
provide 
only 
reasonable, 
not 
absolute, 
assurance 
that 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
control 
system 
are 
met.
These 
inherent 
limitations 
include 
the 
realities 
that 
judgments 
in 
decision 
making 
can 
be 
faulty
, 
that 
alternative 
reasoned 
judgments 
can 
be 
drawn, 
or 
that 
breakdowns 
can 
occur 
because 
of 
a 
simple 
error 
or 
mistake. 
Additionally
, 
controls 
can 
be 
circumvented 
by 
the 
individual 
acts 
of 
some 
persons, 
by 
collusion 
of 
two 
or 
more 
people 
or 
by 
an 
unauthorized 
override 
of 
the 
controls. 
Accordingly
, 
because 
of 
the 
inherent 
limitations 
in 
our 
control 
system, 
misstatements 
due 
to 
error 
or 
fraud 
may 
occur 
and 
not 
be 
detected, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
a 
material 
weakness 
in 
our 
internal 
controls 
over 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
restatement 
of 
previously 
filed 
financial 
statements.
Our
 
stock 
price 
can 
be 
volatile.
Our 
stock 
price 
can 
fluctuate 
widely 
in 
response 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
factors 
including:
Ł 
variations in our quarterly results;
Ł 
changes in market valuations of companies in the 
financial services industry;
Ł 
governmental and regulatory legislation or actions;
Ł 
issuances of shares of common stock or other securities 
in the future;
Ł 
changes in dividends;
Ł 
the addition or departure of key personnel;
Ł 
cyclical fluctuations;
Ł 
changes in financial estimates or recommendations by 
securities analysts regarding us or shares of our common 
stock;
Ł 
announcements by us or our competitors of new services 
or technology
, acquisitions, or joint ventures; and
Ł 
activity by short sellers and changing government 
restrictions on such activity
.
General 
market 
fluctuations, 
industry 
factors, 
and 
general 
economic 
and 
political 
conditions 
and 
events, 
such 
as 
terrorist 
attacks, 
economic 
slowdowns 
or 
recessions, 
interest 
rate 
changes, 
credit 
loss 
trends, 
or 
currency 
fluctuations, 
also 
could 
cause 
our

price 
to 
decrease 
regardless 
of 
operating 
results. 
For 
the 
above 
and 
other 
reasons, 
the

price 
of 
our

may 
not 
accurately

EXECUTIVE 
OVER
VIEW
Economic 
The 
economy 
grew 
modestly 
in 
2014, 
with 
gains 
in 
consumer 
spending, 
business 
investment, 
and 
employment. 
The 
unemployment 
rate 
finished 
the 
year 
at 
5.6%. 
Fixed 
income 
and 
equity 
markets 
fluctuated 
significantly 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter
, 
with 
the 
S&P
 
500 
volatility 
index 
peaking 
at 
levels 
not 
seen 
since 
2012. 
Current 
economic 
conditions 
are 
likely 
to 
keep 
financial 
market 
volatility 
at 
elevated 
levels. 
Corporate 
profits 
grew 
modestly 
in 
2014, 
aided 
by 
a 
slight 
increase 
in 
revenue 
and 
a 
continuation 
of 
operational 
rightsizing. 
The 
real 
national 
Gross 
Domestic 
Product 
grew 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
2.4% 
during 
2014, 
compared 
to 
2.2% 
during 
2013. 
Consumer 
confidence 
increased 
during 
the 
year
, 
propelled 
by 
a 
more 
favorable 
assessment 
of 
current 
economic 
and 
labor 
market 
conditions. 
The 
concern 
regarding 
the 
persistently 
low 
rate 
of 
inflation 
in 
the 
U.S. 
increased 
when 
U.S. 
crude 
oil 
and 
natural 
gas 
supplies 
flooded 
global 
markets, 
while 
weakening 
Asian 
and 
European 
economies 
dampened 
demand. 
Overall, 
the 
U.S. 
macroeconomic 
environment 
outlook 
suggests 
continued 
steady 
growth 
in 
2015 
as 
a 
more 
neutral 
fiscal 
policy 
stance 
and 
low 
ener
gy 
prices 
boost 
consumer 
spending, 
in 
spite 
of 
wage 
stagnation.
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 
continued 
to 
maintain 
a 
highly 
accommodative 
monetary 
policy 
and 
indicated 
that 
this 
policy 
would 
remain 
in 
ef
fect 
for 
a 
considerable 
time 
after 
the 
completion 
of 
its 
asset 
purchase 
program. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
 
concluded 
its 
asset 
purchase 
program 
in 
October 
2014. 
The 
further 
reduction 
of 
its 
asset 
purchases 
was 
in 
response 
to 
improving 
labor 
market 
and 
other 
economic 
indicators. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 
noted 
that 
its 
sizable 
holdings 
of 
longer
-term 
government 
securities 
should 
maintain 
downward 
pressure 
on 
longer
-term 
interest 
rates, 
thereby 
supporting 
housing 
markets 
and 
fostering 
accommodative 
financial 
conditions. 
During 
2014, 
the 
yield 
curve 
flattened 
considerably 
as 
expectations 
for 
future 
inflation 
and 
global 
expansion 
moderated. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 
continues 
to 
forecast 
economic 
growth 
strengthening 
from 
current 
levels 
with 
appropriate 
policy 
accommodation, 
a 
gradual 
decline 
in 
unemployment, 
and 
the 
expectation 
of 
gradually 
increasing 
inflation 
over 
the 
longer
-term. 
The 
market 
expectation 
is 
for 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
to 
begin 
tightening 
its 
monetary 
policy 
at 
a 
measured 
pace 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2015 
and 
for 
the 
yield 
curve 
to 
remain 
flat 
as 
future 
inflation 
expectation 
is 
contained 
by 
low 
commodity 
prices 
and 
global 
economic 
weakness. 
The 
precise 
timing 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
 
beginning 
to 
tighten 
its 
monetary 
policy 
remains 
uncertain.
Financial 
Performance
W
e 
demonstrated 
improved 
financial 
performance 
in 
2014 
by 
generating 
solid 
earnings 
growth, 
growing 
loans 
and 
deposits, 
and 
maintaining 
expense 
discipline. 
W
e 
also 
experienced 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
asset 
quality 
during 
the 
year
, 
which 
27
helped 
to 
of
fset 
the 
negative 
impact 
of 
the 
sustained 
low 
rate 
environment 
on 
revenues. 
These 
favorable 
developments 
helped 
enable 
us 
to 
double 
the 
capital 
return 
for 
our 
shareholders 
by 
increasing 
our 
dividend 
and 
buying 
back 
more 
shares. 
Separately
, 
we 
addressed 
several 
outstanding 
legacy 
mortgage-
related 
matters, 
including 
a 
fourth 
quarter 
legal 
provision 
to 
increase 
legal 
reserves 
and 
complete 
the 
resolution 
of 
a 
specific 
matter
. 
Our 
net 
income 
available 
to 
common 
shareholders 
totaled 
$1.7 
billion
 
for 
2014, 
an 
increase 
of 
33%
 
compared 
to 
2013, 
with 
diluted 
earnings 
per 
average 
common 
share 
of 
$3.23
, 
up 
34%
 
from 
the 
prior 
year
. 
Our 
core 
earnings 
growth 
during 
2014 
reflected 
our 
focus 
on 
expanding 
client 
relationships 
and 
executing 
our 
core 
strategies. 
Coming 
into 
2014, 
we 
faced 
several 
meaningful 
revenue 
headwinds, 
namely 
the 
end 
of 
elevated 
mortgage 
refinance 
activity 
and 
the 
ongoing 
impact 
of 
the 
prolonged 
low 
rate 
environment 
on 
net 
interest 
mar
gin. 
However
, 
we 
remained 
focused 
on 
the 
commitments 
that 
we 
made 
to 
our 
stakeholders, 
and 
we 
delivered 
on 
those 
goals.

revenue 
decreased 
$57 
million 
during 
the 
year
, 
compared 
to 
2013. 
The 
slight 
decrease 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
foregone 
RidgeW
orth 
revenue 
and 
significantly 
lower 
mortgage 
production 
income 
resulting 
from 
a 
45%
 
decline 
in

due 
to 
lower

. 
Lar

Looking 
forward, 
we 
expect 
net

in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015 
to 
decline 
from 
the 
fourth

2014 
level, 
driven 
primarily 
by 
lower 
commercial 
loan 
swap 
income. 
W

will

carefully 
manage 
the 
usage

sensitivity 
of 
our

in

of

our

reduce 
our

decreased 
$193 
million
, 
or 
4%
, 
compared 
to

. 
These 
reductions 
reflect 
a 
combination 
of 
our

lower

and 
the

improved

performance 
in

as 
well 
as 
our 
investments 
in 
key 
growth 
areas. 
As 
we 
look 
to 
2015, 
we 
do 
not 
expect 
core

to 
decline 
from 
the

however
, 
we 
will 
have 
to

During

to 
66.7%

in

the

W

get 
of 
less

our 
goal 
is 
for 
our 
tangible 
ef

ratio 
to 
be 
slightly 
below 
63%. 
Further 
progress 
in 
2015 
will 
be 
much 
more 
challenging 
than 
2014 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
 
(1) 
we 
are 
expecting 
commercial 
loan 
swap 
income 
to 
decline 
by 
$185 
million, 
which 
represents 
an 
approximate 
150-basis-point 
headwind 
to 
our 
ef
ficiency 
ratio; 
(2) 
our 
core 
expenses 
have 
declined 
significantly 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years 
and 
we 
do 
not 
anticipate 
further 
declines; 
and 
(3) 
having 
achieved 
a 
better 
than 
projected 
result 
in 
2014, 
we 
are 
starting 
from 
a 
lower 
base. 
Irrespective 
of 
the 
short-term 
trajectory
, 
we 
remain 
firmly 
committed 
to 
delivering 
further 
ef
ficiency 
improvement 
in 
2015, 
even 
if 
modest, 
to 
stay 
on 
track

of

Our 
asset 
quality 
exhibited 
meaningful 
improvement 
during 
2014
. 
T
otal 
NPL
s 
declined 
35%
 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
, 
primarily 
reflecting 
reductions 
in 
our 
residential 
loan 
portfolio. 
This 
significant 
reduction 
in 
the 
NPL
 
portfolio 
was 
achieved 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
net 
char
ge-of

declining 
21 
basis 
points 
to 
0.34%
 
during 
2014
, 
with 
both 
measures 
reaching 
new 
multi-year 
lows. 
Over 
the 
near 
term, 
we 
expect 
further
, 
though 
moderating, 
declines 
in 
NPL
s, 
primarily 
in 
the 
residential 
portfolio. 
Reductions 
in 
OREO
 
also 
continued, 
declining 
42%
 
from 
2013 
to 
$99 
million
, 
the 
lowest 
level 
since 
2006. 
Early 
stage 
delinquencies, 
a 
leading 
indicator 
of 
asset 
quality
, 
particularly 
for 
consumer 
loans, 
improved 
during 
the 
year
, 
both 
in 
total 
and 
when 
excluding 
government-guaranteed 
loan 
delinquencies. 
While 
improving 
economic 
conditions 
have 
played 
a 
role 
in 
our 
strong 
asset 
quality 
performance, 
it 
is 
also 
the 
result 
of 
significant 
actions 
we 
have 
taken 
over 
the 
past 
several 
years 
to 
de-risk 
our 
balance 
sheet 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
our 
production.
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
ALLL
 
balance 
equaled 
1.46%
 
of 
total 
loans, 
a 
decline 
of 
14
 
basis 
points 
compared 
to 
December€31,

The 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
decreased 
$210 
million
, 
or 
38%
, 
compared 
to 
2013
. 
The 
decline 
in 
the 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
was 
lar
gely 
attributable 
to 
improvements 
in 
credit 
quality 
trends, 
particularly 
in 
our 
residential 
and 
CRE
 
portfolios, 
and 
lower

Assuming 
that 
the 
loan 
loss 
provision 
remains 
relatively 
stable 
to 
down 
slightly 
and 
loan 
growth 
continues, 
we 
expect 
the 
ALLL
 
to 
period-end

to 
gradually

down.

average 
client

up 
9%. 
Net

also

compared 
to 
2013, 
driven 
by 
solid 
revenue 
growth 
and 
a 
lower

Fees

Mortgage 
Banking
Over 
the 
past 
year
, 
our 
core 
Mortgage

net 
interest 
income 
was 
more 
than 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
fee 
income. 
Core 
mortgage 
production 
income 
declined 
approximately 
50% 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year; 
however
, 
mortgage 
servicing 
income 
more 
than 
doubled, 
driven 
mainly 
by 
lower 
prepayments 
in 
the 
servicing 
portfolio 
and 
increased 
service 
fees 
resulting 
from 
servicing 
portfolio 
acquisitions 
in 
2014.

Changes 
in 
net 
interest 
income 
are 
attributed 
to 
either 
changes 
in 
average 
balances 
(volume 
change) 
or 
changes 
in 
average 
rates 
(rate 
change) 
for 
earning 
assets 
and 
sources 
of 
funds 
on 
which 
interest 
is 
received 
or 
paid. 
V
olume 
change 
is 
calculated 
as 
change 
in 
volume 
times 
the 
previous 
rate, 
while 
rate 
change 
is 
change 
in 
rate 
times 
the 
previous 
volume. 
The 
rate/
volume 
change, 
change 
in 
rate 
times 
change 
in 
volume, 
is 
allocated 
between 
volume 
change 
and

at 
the 
ratio 
each

bears 
to 
the 
absolute

Interest

the 
ef

to 
a

Net 
Interest 
Income/Margin
Net 
interest 
income 
on 
a 
FTE
 
basis 
was 
virtually 
unchanged 
at 
$5.0 
billion
 
during 
both 
2014 
and 
2013. 
Compared 
to 
2013
, 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
decreased 
17 
basis 
points 
to 
3.07%
, 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
18
 
basis 
point 
decline 
in 
average 
earning 
asset 
yields. 
The 
earning 
asset 
yield 
decline 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
lower 
loan 
yields, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
improved 
yields 
in 
LHFS 
and 
trading 
assets. 
Partially 
of
fsetting 
the 
decline 
in 
earning 
asset 
yield 
was 
a 
two 
basis 
point 
reduction 
in 
interest 
bearing 
liability 
costs 
driven 
by 
lower 
rates 
paid 
on 
interest-bearing 
deposits.
A

earning 
assets 
increased 
$8.5 
billion, 
or 
6%, 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December€31, 
2014
 
compared 
to 
2013
, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
an 
$8.2 
billion, 
or 
7%, 
increase 
in 
average 
loans 
and 
a 
$1.4 
billion, 
or 
6%, 
increase 
in 
average 
securities 
AFS. 
The 
increase 
in 
average 
loans 
was 
broad-based 
across 
most 
loan 
categories, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
tar
geted 
growth 
in 
the 
C&I
 
and 
CRE 
loan 
categories, 
and 
other 
consumer 
direct 
loans. 
These 
increases 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
guaranteed 
residential 
mortgages. 
The 
decrease 
in 
government-guaranteed 
loans 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
$2.3 
billion 
of 
guaranteed 
residential 
mortgages. 
A
verage 
nonaccrual 
loans 
declined 
31%, 
driven 
by 
the 
ongoing 
resolution 
of 
nonperforming

, 
primarily 
driven

basis 
point 
decline 
in

The

in 
the

on

was 
driven 
by 
broad-based

across 
the

driven 
by

the

we 
also

to 
recognize 
interest 
income 
over 
the

Interest 
income 
from 
our 
commercial

swaps 
decreased 
to 
$387 
million 
during 
2014
, 
compared 
to 
$417 
million
 
during 
2013
. 
The 
decline 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
income 
from 
the 
maturity 
of 
$4.2 
billion 
of 
active 
swaps 
during 
2014

$3.3

of 
previously 
terminated

that 
reached 
their 
original 
maturity 
date 
during 
2014. 
As 
we 
manage 
our 
interest 
rate 
risk 
we 
may 
continue 
to 
purchase 
additional 
and/or 
terminate 
existing 
interest 
rate 
swaps.
Remaining 
swaps 
on 
commercial 
loans 
have 
maturities 
through 
2019. 
The 
average 
maturity 
of 
our 
active

Compared 
to 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2013
, 
average 
interest-bearing 
liabilities 
increased 
$7.2 
billion, 
or 
7%, 
primarily 
due 
to 
increases 
in 
average 
lower

and 
average 
other 
short-term 
borrowings 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014
. 
These 
increases 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
average 
time 
deposits. 
The 
increase 
in 
average 
long-term 
debt 
was 
primarily 
attributable 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
senior 
unsecured 
debt 
issuances 
given 
average

growth 
exceeded 
average

The 
$1.2 
billion, 
or 
24%, 
increase 
in

primarily 
due

The

basis 
point 
reduction 
in 
rates 
paid 
on 
average 
interest-bearing 
liabilities 
at 
December€31, 
2014
 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
a 
five

decline 
in

increase 
in 
rates 
paid 
on 
long-term

primarily 
attributable 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
issuances. 
The 
decline 
in 
the 
average 
rate 
paid 
on 
interest-bearing 
deposits 
was 
a 
result 
of 
the 
improved 
mix 
driven 
by 
the 
shift 
from

deposits 
to 
lower
-
cost

as 
well 
as 
a 
reduction

as

CDs 
matured.
During 
2014, 
net 
interest 
mar
gin 
declined 
more 
than 
anticipated 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
year
, 
as 
Wholesale 
Banking 
loan 
growth 
was 
stronger 
than 
expected, 
commercial

additional 
information.
The 
increase 
in 
noninterest 
income 
from 
the 
prior 
year 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
mortgage

income 
and 
the 
gain 
on 
sale 
of 
RidgeW
orth
 
during 
the 
second

Additionally
, 
increases 
in 
capital 
markets-related 
income,

investment 
services 
income, 
card 
fee 
income, 
gains 
on 
the 
sale 
of 
government-guaranteed 
residential 
mortgages, 
and 
structured 
leasing 
revenue 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
improved 
noninterest 
income. 
These 
increases 
in 
income 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
declines 
in 
mortgage

Investment

income 
increased 
$48 
million
, 
or 
13%
, 
from 
the

categories, 
including

income 
decreased 
$1
13 
million
, 
or 
36%
, 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year 
resulting 
from 
a 
45%
 
decline 
in

due 
to 
lower

, 
as

Partially

decrease, 
was 
a 
$102

decline 
in

Mortgage 
servicing 
related 
income 
increased 
$109 
million
 
compared 
to 
the 
prior

primarily 
due 
to

resulting 
in

, 
and 
improved 
net 
MSR

Additionally
,

increased 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the

portfolio, 
partially 
resulting 
from 
the

noninterest 
income 
increased 
$45 
million
, 
or 
30%
, 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year 
primarily 
due 
to 
higher 
gains 
on 
the 
sale 
of 
mortgage 
loans 
in 
2014, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
higher

Additionally
, 
during 
the 
current 
year
, 
$15 
million
 
of

due

Noninterest 
expense 
and 
adjusted 
noninterest 
expense 
decreased 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year
, 
primarily 
due 
to 
our

ef
ficiency 
and 
expense 
management 
focus, 
lower 
cyclical 
costs, 
and 
the 
sale 
of 
RidgeW

. 
W
e 
met 
our 
commitment 
to 
reduce 
our 
expense 
base 
from 
2013, 
as 
adjusted 
noninterest 
expense 
was 
down 
nearly 
$200 
million, 
or 
4% 
year
-over
-year
.
Personnel 
expenses 
increased 
$61 
million
, 
or 
2%
, 
compared 
to 
2013
, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
higher 
incentive 
compensation 
due 
to 
improved 
business 
performance 
in 
2014
, 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
our 
pay-for
-performance 
philosophy
. 
Higher 
incentive 
compensation 
was 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
employee 
benefits 
costs, 
including 
medical 
costs, 
driven 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
full-time 
equivalent 
employees. 
Full-time 
equivalent 
employees 
declined 
6% 
compared 
to 
2013
, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
continued 
ef

improvements 
in 
our 
branch 
staf
fing 
model, 
the 
implementation 
of 
several 
expense 
initiatives, 
and 
the 
sale 
of 
RidgeW
orth
. 
During 
2014, 
we 
further 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
branches 
by 
3% 
compared 
to 
the

year
.
Operating 
losses 
decreased 
$62 
million
, 
or 
12%
, 
compared 
to 
2013
. 
The 
decrease 
was 
lar
gely 
due 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
mortgage-

expenses.

mortgage-related 
items.
Outside

expense, 
net 
occupancy 
expense, 
and 
equipment 
expense 
all 
decreased 
during 
2014 
compared 
to 
2013
. 
These 
decreases 
were 
primarily 
due 
to 
our 
continued 
focus 
on 
cost 
containment 
and 
expense 
management.
Regulatory 
assessments 
decreased 
$39 
million
, 
or 
22%
, 
compared 
to 
2013, 
primarily 
due 
to 
declines 
in 
our 
FDIC
 
insurance 
premium, 
reflecting 
our 
improved 
risk 
profile. 
Credit 
and 
collection 
services 
decreased 
$173 
million
 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year
, 
lar
gely 
due 
to 
the 
$96 
million 
addition 
to 
the 
mortgage 
servicing 
advance 
allowance 
during 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2013, 
resulting 
from 
an 
expanded 
review 
of 
our 
servicing 
advance 
practices, 
as 
well 
as 
lower 
cyclical 
costs. 
Going 
into 
2015, 
we 
do 
not 
expect 
these 
cyclical 
costs 
to 
be 
a 
meaningful 
driver 
of 
change 
in 
our 
expense 
base.
Other 
noninterest 
expense 
decreased 
$42 
million
, 
or 
9%
, 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year
, 
lar
gely 
due 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
operating 
expenses 
associated 
with 
af
fordable 
housing 
assets 
that 
were 
sold 
during 
2014 
and 
real

in 
2013 
as 
we 
reassessed 
some 
of 
our 
corporate 
real 
estate 
leases 
and 
holdings. 
These 
declines 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
higher 
severance

net 
char

W
e 
report 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
in 
three 
loan 
segments: 
commercial, 
residential, 
and 
consumer
. 
Loans 
are 
assigned 
to 
these 
segments 
based 
upon 
the 
type 
of 
borrower
, 
purpose, 
collateral, 
and/or 
our 
underlying 
credit 
management 
processes. 
Additionally
, 
within 
each 
loan 
segment, 
we 
have 
identified 
loan 
types, 
which 
further 
disaggregate 
loans 
based 
upon 
common 
characteristics.
Commercial
The 
C&I
 
loan 
type 
includes 
loans 
to 
fund 
business 
operations 
or 
activities, 
loans 
secured 
by 
owner
-occupied 
properties, 
corporate 
credit 
cards, 
and 
other 
wholesale 
lending 
activities. 
CRE
 
and 
commercial 
construction 
loan 
types 
include 
investor 
loans 
where 
repayment 
is 
lar
gely 
dependent 
upon 
the 
operation, 
refinance, 
or 
sale 
of 
the 
underlying 
real 
estate. 
Commercial 
loans 
and 
construction 
loans 
secured 
by 
owner
-occupied 
properties 
are 
classified 
as 
C&I
 
loans, 
as 
the 
primary 
source 
of 
loan 
repayment 
for 
owner
-occupied 
properties 
is 
business 
income 
and 
not 
real 
estate 
operations.
Residential
Residential 
mortgages 
consist 
of 
loans 
secured 
by 
1-4 
family 
homes, 
mostly 
prime 
first-lien 
loans, 
both 
government-
guaranteed 
and 
nonguaranteed. 
Residential 
construction 
loans 
include 
owner
-occupied 
residential 
lot 
loans 
and 
construction-
to-perm 
loans. 
Home 
equity 
products 
consist 
of 
equity 
lines 
of 
credit 
and 
closed-end 
equity 
loans 
that 
may 
be 
in 
either 
a 
first 
lien 
or 
junior 
lien 
position.
Consumer
The 
loan 
types 
comprising 
our 
consumer 
loan 
segment 
include 
government-guaranteed 
student 
loans, 
other 
direct 
loans 
(consisting 
primarily 
of 
direct 
auto 
loans, 
loans 
secured 
by 
negotiable 
collateral, 
unsecured 
loans 
and 
private 
student 
loans), 
indirect

W
e 
believe 
that 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
is 
well 
diversified 
by 
product, 
client, 
and 
geography
. 
However
, 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
may 
be 
exposed 
to 
concentrations 
of 
credit 
risk 
which 
exist 
in 
relation 
to 
individual 
borrowers 
or 
groups 
of 
borrowers, 
types 
of 
collateral, 
certain 
industries, 
certain 
loan 
products, 
or 
regions 
of 
the 
country
. 
While 
the 
ener
gy 
and 
utilities 
industry 
vertical 
is 
an 
important 
component 
of 
our 
overall 
CIB
 
business, 
it 
only 
represents 
4% 
of

approximately 
70%

W
e 
continued 
to 
make 
progress 
in 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
diversification 
strategy
, 
as 
we 
were 
successful 
in 
growing 
tar
geted 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
balances 
while 
reducing 
our 
exposure 
to 
certain 
residential 
real 
estate 
secured 
loans. 
Additionally
, 
much 
of 
our 
success 
growing 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
loans 
has 
been 
driven 
by 
our 
national 
banking 
delivery 
channel, 
which 
provides 
us 
with 
additional 
geographic 
diversity
. 
Overall 
economic 
indicators 
in 
our 
markets 
are 
improving, 
and 
or
ganic 
loan 
production 
in 
C&I
 
and 
other 
consumer 
loans 
has 
been 
solid. 
A
verage 
loans 
during 
2014
 
totaled 
$130.9 
billion
, 
up 
$8.2 
billion, 
while 
average 
performing 
loans 
increased 
$8.6 
billion, 
or 
7%, 
driven 
by 
broad-based 
growth 
across 
the 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
portfolios. 
See 
the 
"Net 
Interest 
Income/Mar
gin" 
section 
of 
this 
MD&A
 
for 
more 
information 
regarding 
average 
loan 
balances.
Commercial 
loans 
increased 
$9.1 
billion
, 
or 
14%
, 
during 
2014
 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
. 
C&I
 
loans 
increased 
$7.5 
billion
, 
or 
13%
, 
from 
December€31, 
2013
, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
broad-based 
growth 
generated 
by 
our 
corporate 
and 
commercial 
banking 
businesses. 
The 
most 
notable 
increases 
were 
in 
the 
real 
estate 
and 
diversified 
financials 
and 
insurance 
industry 
sectors. 
The 
growth 
in 
C&I
 
loans 
was 
partly 
of
fset 
by 
the 
transfer 
of 
$470 
million
 
of 
loans 
to 
LHFS
 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014. 
During 
2014, 
CRE
 
loans 
increased 
$1.3 
billion
, 
or 
23%
, 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
 
reflecting 
growth 
in 
our 
institutional 
and 
38
regional 
businesses, 
including 
the 
purchase 
of 
approximately 
$735 
million
 
in 
loans 
from 
third 
parties 
during 
2014
. 
Residential 
loans 
decreased 
$4.4 
billion
, 
or 
10%
, 
during 
2014
 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
a 
$2.8 
billion
, 
or 
81%
, 
decrease 
in 
government-guaranteed 
residential 
mortgages, 
a 
$969 
million
, 
or 
4%
, 
decrease 
in 
non-
guaranteed 
residential 
mortgages, 
and 
a 
$545 
million
, 
or 
4%
, 
decrease 
in 
home 
equity 
products. 
The 
decrease 
in 
government-
guaranteed 
loans 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
$2.3 
billion

on 
a 
servicing 
retained 
basis, 
resulting 
in 
$60 
million
 
of 
pre-tax 
gains 
during 
2014. 
The 
decrease 
in 
nonguaranteed 
residential 
mortgages 
was 
driven 
by 
payments 
and 
char
ge-of
fs, 
partly 
of
fset 
by 
new 
originations, 
and 
the 
sale 
of 
$207 
million
 
of 
accruing 
TDR
s 
and 
NPL
s 
to 
further 
enhance 
our 
asset 
quality 
position, 
resulting 
in 
a 
$6 
million
 
gain, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
sale 
of 
$253 
million
 
of 
performing 
nonguaranteed 
mortgages, 
resulting 
in 
an 
insignificant 
loss.
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
39%
 
of 
our 
home 
equity 
products 
were 
in 
a 
first 
lien 
position 
and 
61%
 
were 
in 
a 
junior 
lien 
position. 
For 
home 
equity 
products 
in 
a 
junior 
lien 
position, 
we 
own 
or 
service 
29%
 
of 
the 
loans 
that 
are 
senior 
to 
the 
home 
equity 
product. 
Additionally
, 
approximately 
16%
 
of 
the 
home 
equity 
line 
portfolio 
is 
due 
to 
convert 
to 
amortizing 
term 
loans 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2015 
and 
an 
additional 
45%
 
enter 
the 
conversion 
phase 
over 
following 
three 
years.€Based 
on 
historical 
trends, 
within 
12 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
their 
draw 
period, 
approximately 
77%
 
of 
all 
accounts, 
and 
approximately 
65%
 
of 
accounts 
with 
a 
balance, 
are 
closed 
or 
refinanced 
into 
an 
amortizing 
loan 
or 
a

credit. 
W
e 
perform 
credit 
management 
activities 
to 
limit 
our 
loss 
exposure 
on 
home 
equity 
accounts. 
These 
activities 
may 
result 
in 
the 
suspension 
of 
available 
credit 
and 
curtailment 
of 
available 
draws 
of 
most 
home 
equity 
junior 
lien 
accounts 
when 
the 
first 
lien 
position 
is 
delinquent, 
including 
when 
the 
junior

is 
still 
current. 
W
e 
monitor 
the 
delinquency 
status 
of 
first 
mortgages 
serviced 
by 
other 
parties. 
Additionally
, 
we 
actively 
monitor 
refreshed 
credit 
bureau 
scores 
of 
borrowers 
with 
junior 
liens, 
as 
these 
scores 
are 
highly 
sensitive 
to 
first 
lien 
mortgage 
delinquency
. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
our 
home 
equity 
junior 
lien 
loss 
severity 
was 
approximately 
80%
 
and 
87%
, 
respectively
. 
The 
average 
borrower 
FICO
 
score 
related 
to 
loans 
in 
our 
home 
equity 
portfolio 
was 
approximately 
760 
at 
both 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
and 
the 
average 
outstanding 
loan 
size 
was 
approximately 
$46,000 
and 
$48,000 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
respectively
.
Consumer 
loans 
increased 
$568 
million
, 
or 
3%
, 
during 
2014
 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
. 
The 
increase 
is 
attributable 
to 
the 
$1.7 
billion
, 
or 
62%
, 
increase 
in 
other 
direct 
loans, 
which 
was 
lar
gely 
related 
to 
origination 
of 
high 
credit 
quality 
consumer 
loans 
through 
our 
LightStream 
online 
lending 
business, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
high 
credit 
quality 
home 
improvement 
loans. 
The 
increase 
in 
consumer 
loans 
was 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
the 
$718 
million
, 
or 
13%
, 
decrease 
in 
government-guaranteed 
student 
loans 
and 
the 
$628 
million
, 
or 
6%
, 
decrease 
in 
indirect 
loans 
during 
2014
 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
. 
The 
decrease 
in 
government-guaranteed 
student 
loans 
was 
due 
to 
paydowns 
and
 
the 
sale 
of 
$335 
million
 
of 
these 
loans 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014. 
Indirect 
loans 
decreased 
due 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
approximately 
$475 
million
 
of 
indirect 
auto 
loans 
and 
the 
transfer 
of 
approximately 
$600 
million
 
of 
indirect 
auto 
loans 
to 
LHFS
 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
growth 
in 
our 
portfolio. 
The 
net 
gain 
or 
loss 
on 
the 
sale 
and 
transfer 
of 
the 
indirect 
auto 
and 
student 
loans 
was 
immaterial.
Collectively
, 
these 
loan 
sale 
transactions 
during 
the 
year
, 
along 
with 
the 
loan 
transfers 
described 
below
, 
were 
part 
of 
our 
strategy 
to 
optimize 
our 
balance 
sheet 
and 
improve 
returns. 
Going 
forward, 
we 
will 
continue 
to 
opportunistically 
evaluate 
loan 
sales 
to 
further 
this 
strategy
.
Loans 
Held 
for 
Sale
LHFS
 
increased 
$1.5 
billion
, 
or 
90%
, 
from 
December€31, 
2013
 
to 
December€31, 
2014
, 
primarily 
reflecting 
the 
approximately 
$600 
million
 
of 
indirect 
auto 
loans 
and 
$470 
million
 
of 
C&I
 
loans 
transferred 
from 
LHFI
 
to 
LHFS
 
as 
part 
of 
our 
strategy 
to 
optimize 
our 
balance 
sheet 
and 
improve 
returns. 
Also 
contributing 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
LHFS 
was 
an 
increase 
in 
mortgage 
loan 
volume 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
2014 
as 
the 
continued 
low 
interest 
rate 
environment 
drove 
higher 
production.
Asset 
Quality
The 
asset 
quality 
condition 
of 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
continued 
to 
trend 
favorably 
during 
2014
, 
driven 
by 
overall 
improvements 
in 
the 
economy
, 
improved 
residential 
housing 
markets, 
resolution 
of 
existing 
NP
A
s, 
and 
lower 
levels 
of 
new 
NPL
s. 
This 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
positive 
trends 
in 
our 
residential 
portfolios 
reflected 
in 
lower 
delinquencies, 
lower 
loss 
severities, 
and 
higher 
prices 
upon 
disposition 
of 
foreclosed 
assets. 
The 
overall 
improvement 
in 
asset 
quality 
is 
also 
the 
result 
of 
significant 
actions 
we 
have 
taken 
over 
the 
past 
several 
years 
to 
de-risk 
and 
diversify 
our 
balance 
sheet 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
new 
loan 
production.

$337 
million
, 
or 
35%
,

, 
down

W
e 
expect 
further
,

in

in 
the

primarily 
driven 
by

Provision 
for 
Credit 
Losses
The 
total 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
includes 
the 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
and 
the 
provision 
for 
unfunded 
commitments. 
The 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
is 
the 
result 
of 
a 
detailed 
analysis 
performed 
to 
estimate 
an 
appropriate 
and 
adequate 
ALLL
. 
During 
2014
, 
the 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
decreased 
$210 
million
, 
or 
38%
, 
compared 
to 
2013
. 
The 
decline 
in 
the 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
was 
lar
gely 
attributable 
to 
improvements 
in 
credit 
quality 
trends, 
particularly 
in 
our 
residential 
and 
CRE 
portfolios, 
and 
lower 
net 
char
ge-of
fs 
during 
2014 
compared 
to 
2013. 
The 
decrease 
was 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
the 
ef
fects 
of 
loan 
growth 
in 
the 
commercial 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolios 
and 
an 
adjustment 
made 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014 
to 
account 
for 
the 
recent 
decline 
in 
oil 
prices. 
W
e 
expect 
our 
provision 
for 
loan 
losses 
in 
2015 
to 
be 
relatively 
stable 
to 
down 
slightly 
from 
2014, 
as 
continued 
improvement 
in 
asset 
quality 
may 
be 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
loan 
40
growth. 
However
, 
the 
ultimate 
level 
of 
reserves 
and 
provision 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
our 
quarterly 
review 
processes, 
which 
consider 
credit 
quality 
trends 
and 
risks 
associated 
with 
our 
LHFI 
portfolio, 
including 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
expected 
loss 
calculations, 
delinquencies, 
performing 
status, 
size 
and 
composition 
of 
the 
loan 
portfolio,

Restructured 
Loans
T
o 
maximize 
the 
collection 
of 
loan 
balances, 
we 
evaluate 
troubled 
loans 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis 
to 
determine 
if 
a 
loan 
modification 
would 
be 
appropriate. 
W
e 
pursue 
loan 
modifications 
when 
there 
is 
a 
reasonable 
chance 
that 
an 
appropriate 
modification 
would 
allow 
our 
client 
to 
continue 
servicing 
the 
debt. 
For 
loans 
secured 
by 
residential 
real 
estate, 
if 
the 
client 
demonstrates 
a 
loss 
of 
income 
such 
that 
the 
client 
cannot 
reasonably 
support 
a 
modified 
loan, 
we 
may 
pursue 
short 
sales 
and/or 
deed-in-lieu 
arrangements. 
For 
loans 
secured 
by 
income 
producing 
commercial 
properties, 
we 
perform 
an 
in-
depth 
and 
ongoing 
programmatic 
review
. 
W
e 
review 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
cash 
flows, 
loan 
structures, 
collateral 
values, 
and 
guarantees 
to 
identify 
loans 
within 
our 
income 
producing 
commercial 
loan 
portfolio 
that 
are 
most 
likely 
to 
experience 
distress. 
Based 
on 
our 
review 
of 
these 
factors 
and 
our 
assessment 
of 
overall 
risk, 
we 
evaluate 
the 
benefits 
of 
proactively 
initiating 
discussions 
with 
our 
clients 
to 
improve 
a 
loan™
s 
risk 
profile. 
In 
some 
cases, 
we 
may 
renegotiate 
terms 
of 
their 
loans 
so 
that 
they 
have 
a 
higher 
likelihood 
of 
continuing 
to 
perform. 
T
o 
date, 
we 
have 
restructured 
loans 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
ways 
to 
help 
our 
clients 
service 
their 
debt 
and 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
for 
additional 
losses. 
The 
primary 
restructuring 
methods 
being 
of
fered 
to 
our 
residential 
clients 
are 
reductions 
in 
interest 
rates 
and 
extensions 
of 
terms. 
For 
commercial 
loans, 
the 
primary 
restructuring 
method 
is 
the 
extension 
of 
terms.
Loans 
with 
modifications 
deemed 
to 
be 
economic 
concessions 
resulting 
from 
borrower 
financial 
dif
ficulties 
are 
reported 
as 
TDR
s. 
Accruing 
loans 
may 
retain 
accruing 
status 
at 
the 
time 
of 
restructure 
and 
the 
status 
is 
determined 
by
, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
restructure, 
the 
borrower's 
repayment 
history
, 
and 
the 
borrower's 
repayment 
capacity
. 
Nonaccruing 
loans 
that 
are 
modified 
and 
demonstrate 
a 
sustainable 
history 
of 
repayment 
performance, 
typically 
six 
months, 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
modified 
terms 
are 
generally 
reclassified 
to 
accruing 
TDR
 
status. 
Generally
, 
once 
a 
residential 
loan 
becomes 
a 
TDR
, 
we 
expect 
that 
the 
loan 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
reported 
as 
a 
TDR
 
for 
its 
remaining 
life 
even 
after 
returning 
to 
accruing 
status 
unless

culminating 
in

result 
in 
additional

These

The

AFS

is 
managed 
as 
part 
of 
our 
overall 
liquidity 
management 
and 
ALM
 
process 
to 
optimize 
income 
and 
portfolio 
value 
over 
an 
entire 
interest

cycle 
while 
mitigating 
the 
associated 
risks. 
Changes 
in 
the

reflect

to

a

, 
liquid

while 
managing 
our 
interest 
rate

profile. 
The 
amortized

of

increased 
$3.6 
billion
 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December

Notwithstanding

our

of

agency 
securities, 
ABS
, 
and 
private 
MBS
 
declined 
due 
to 
maturities, 
prepayments, 
and 
sales. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
portfolio 
increased 
$4.2 
billion
 
primarily 
due 
to 
portfolio 
growth, 
including 
a 
$593 
million
 
increase 
in 
net 
unrealized 
gains 
due 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
market 
interest

During

Investment 
in 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company
Prior 
to 
September 
2012, 
we 
owned 
common 
shares 
of 
The 
Coca-
Cola 
Company 
since 
1919. 
These 
shares 
grew 
in 
value 
and 
were 
classified 
as 
securities 
AFS 
with 
unrealized 
gains, 
net 
of 
tax, 
recorded 
as 
a 
component 
of 
shareholders' 
equity
. 
Because 
of 
the 
low 
accounting 
cost 
basis 
of 
these 
shares, 
we 
accumulated 
significant 
unrealized 
gains 
in 
shareholders' 
equity
. 
In 
September 
2012, 
we 
divested 
our 
ownership 
of 
The 
Coca-
Cola 
Company 
shares 
through 
sales 
in 
the 
market, 
sales 
to 
the 
counterparty 
under 
certain 
Agreements
, 
and 
a 
charitable 
contribution 
of 
shares. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock 
sales, 
charitable 
contribution, 
and 
termination 
of 
the 
Agreements
, 
we 
recorded 
a 
pre-tax 
gain 
of 
approximately 
$1.9 
billion
 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December

During

, 
we

growth 
and 
improved

the

increased, 
while 
higher

decreased 
due

These 
favorable 
trends 
contributed 
to 
our 
decline 
in 
interest

on

during 
the 
year
. 
A

increased 
$4.9 
billion
, 
or 
4%
, 
compared 
to 
2013, 
driven 
by 
improved 
and 
broad-
based 
growth 
across 
all 
of 
our 
business 
segments. 
While 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
low-cost 
deposit 
growth 
has 
been 
attributable 
to 
clients™
 
desires 
related 
to 
increased

, 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
growth 
reflects 
investments 
we 
have 
made 
in 
client-facing 
platforms, 
as 
well 
as 
our 
overall 
increased 
focus 
on 
meeting 
more 
of 
our 
clients' 
deposit 
needs 
through 
exceptional 
service 
and 
relevant 
deposit 
products. 
Consumer 
and 
commercial 
deposit 
growth 
remains 
one 
of 
our 
key 
areas 
of 
focus. 
During 
2014
, 
we 
continued 
to 
focus 
on 
deepening 
our 
relationships 
with 
existing 
clients, 
growing 
our 
client 
base, 
and 
increasing 
deposits, 
while 
managing 
the 
rates 
we 
pay 
for 
deposits. 
W
e 
maintained 
pricing 
discipline, 
through 
a 
judicious 
use 
of 
competitive 
rates 
in 
select 
products 
and 
markets 
as 
we 
allowed 
higher 
rate 
time 
deposits 
to 
run-of
f, 
while 
growing 
balances 
in 
other 
deposit 
categories. 
Other 
initiatives 
to 
attract

included 
advancements 
in 
analytics 
that 
leverage 
client 
segmentation 
to 
identify 
optimal 
products 
and

as 
well 
as 
the

focus 
on 
providing 
clients 
with 
personalized 
options 
and

W

to 
improve

increased 
$447

,

5%
, 
from

partially 
of
fset 
by

short-term 
borrowings 
of 
$154

. 
The 
decrease 
in

was 
primarily 
due 
to

gely 
driven

During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014
, 
our 
long-term 
debt 
increased 
by 
$2.3 
billion
, 
or 
22%
. 
The 
increase 
was 
due 
to 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
$1.0 
billion
 
long-term 
FHLB
 
advance 
during 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2014 
and 
three 
senior 
note 
issuances 
totaling 
$1.5 
billion 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2014. 
Specifically
, 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
we 
issued 
$250 
million
 
of 
3-year 
floating 
rate 
senior 
notes 
and 
$600 
million
 
of 
3-year 
fixed 
rate 
senior 
notes 
under 
our 
Global 
Bank 
Note 
program. 
Additionally
, 
during 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
we 
issued 
$650 
million
 
of 
5-year 
fixed 
rate 
senior 
notes. 
These 
issuances 
allowed 
us 
to 
add 
to 
our 
wholesale 
funding 
at 
relatively 
low 
long-term 
borrowing 
rates. 
Partially 
of
fsetting 
these 
senior 
note 
issuances 
and 
the 
long-term 
FHLB 
advance 
during 
2014 
was 
the 
deconsolidation 
of 
$256 
million
 
of 
VIE 
debt 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
sale 
of

A

increased 
$2.5 
billion
, 
or 
25%
, 
compared 
to 
2013
, 
predominantly 
driven 
by 
the 
same 
factors 
as

related 
to 
senior

issuances 
and 
the 
long-term

Basel 
III
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 
published 
final 
rules 
implementing 
Basel 
III
 
on 
October 
1
1, 
2013. 
The 
rules 
require 
banks 
subject 
to 
the 
standardized 
approach 
for 
R
W
A
 
to 
meet 
revised 
minimum 
regulatory 
capital 
ratios 
beginning 
on 
January 
1, 
2015, 
and 
to 
begin 
transitioning 
to 
revised 
definitions 
of 
regulatory 
capital 
with 
accompanying 
revisions 
to 
capital 
adjustments 
and 
deductions. 
In 
particular
, 
the 
rules 
require 
the 
phase 
out 
of 
non-
qualifying 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
instruments 
such 
as 
trust 
preferred 
securities. 
As 
such, 
beginning 
on 
January 
1, 
2015, 
approximately 
$627 
million
 
in 
principal 
amount 
of 
Parent 
Company
 
trust 
preferred 
and 
other 
hybrid 
capital 
securities 
currently 
outstanding 
will 
start 
to 
be 
phased 
out 
of 
T
ier 
1 
capital, 
qualifying 
instead 
for 
T
ier 
2 
capital 
treatment. 
Accordingly
, 
we 
anticipate 
that 
by 
January 
1, 
2016, 
all 
$627 
million
 
of 
our 
outstanding 
trust 
preferred 
securities 
will 
lose 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
treatment, 
and 
will 
be 
reclassified 
as 
T
ier 
2 
capital.
A
 
transition 
period 
applies 
to 
certain 
capital 
elements 
and 
risk 
weighted 
assets. 
One 
of 
the 
more 
significant 
transitions 
required 
by 
the 
final 
rules 
relates 
to 
the 
risk 
weighting 
applied 
to 
MSRs, 
which 
will 
impact 
the 
CET1 
ratio 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
currently 
disclosed 
CET1 
ratio 
that 
is 
calculated 
on 
a 
fully 
phased-in 
basis. 
Specifically
, 
the 
fully 
phased-in 
risk 
weight 
of 
MSRs 
is 
250%, 
while 
the 
risk 
weight 
to 
be 
applied 
during 
the 
transition 
period 
is 
100%. 
The 
transition 
period 
is 
applicable 
from 
January 
1, 
2015 
through 
December 
31, 
2017.
 
Our 
fully 
phased-in, 
estimated 
Basel 
III
 
CET
 
1
 
ratio 
of 
9.69%
 
at 
December€31, 
2014
 
considers 
the 
250% 
risk-weighting 
for 
MSRs. 
The 
final 
rules 
introduce 
a 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer 
of 
2.5% 
of 
R
W
A
 
that 
is 
layered 
on 
top 
of 
the 
minimum 
capital 
risk-
based 
ratios, 
which 
places 
restrictions 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
retained 
earnings 
that 
may 
be 
used 
for 
capital 
distributions 
or 
discretionary 
bonus 
payments 
as 
risk-based 
capital 
ratios 
approach 
their 
respective 
ﬁadequately 
capitalizedﬂ 
minimums. 
The 
capital 
conservation 
buf
fer 
begins 
to 
take 
ef
fect 
on 
January 
1, 
2016 
and 
is 
fully 
phased-in 
as 
of 
January 
1, 
2019.
The 
final 
rules 
specify 
a 
number 
of 
minimum 
capital 
requirements, 
including 
a 
CET

ratio 
of

for 
a 
reconciliation 
of

ratio 
to

ratio.
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
our 
capital 
ratios 
were 
well 
above 
current 
regulatory 
requirements. 
T
ier 
1 
capital 
ratios 
decreased 
slightly 
during 
2014 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
our 
R
W
A
 
from 
December€31, 
2013
, 
primarily 
the 
result 
of 
loan 
growth 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
of
f-balance 
sheet 
lending 
commitments, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
retained 
earnings 
and 
the 
issuance 
of 
preferred 
stock.
W
e 
declared 
and 
paid 
common 
dividends 
totaling 
$371 
million
, 
or 
$0.70
 
per 
common 
share 
during 
2014
, 
compared 
with 
$188 
million
, 
or 
$0.35
 
per 
common 
share 
during 
2013
. 
Additionally
, 
we 
recognized 
dividends 
on 
our 
preferred 
stock 
of 
$42 
million
 
and 
$37 
million
 
in 
2014
 
and 
2013
, 
respectively
.
V
arious 
regulations 
administered 
by 
federal 
and 
state 
bank 
regulatory 
authorities 
restrict 
the 
Bank
's 
ability 
to 
distribute 
its 
retained 
earnings. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
the 
Bank
's 
capacity 
to 
pay 
cash 
dividends 
to 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
under 
these 
regulations 
totaled 
approximately 
$2.9 
billion
 
and 
$2.6 
billion
, 
respectively
.
During 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
we 
announced 
capital 
plans 
in 
response 
to 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
's 
review 
of 
and 
non-objection 
to 
our 
capital 
plan 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
2014 
CCAR
. 
Our 
capital 
plan 
included 
the 
repurchase 
of 
common 
stock, 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
common 
stock 
dividend, 
and 
maintaining 
the 
current 
level 
of 
preferred 
stock 
dividends. 
T
o 
this 
end, 
the 
Board
 
approved 
the 
repurchase 
of 
up 
to 
$450 
million 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
between 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2014 
and 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
quarterly 
common 
stock 
dividend 
to 
$0.20 
per 
common 
share, 
which 
reflected 
an 
increase 
from 
$0.10 
per 
common 
share 
paid 
prior 
to 
the 
second 
quarter
. 
During 
the 
second 
quarter
, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
 
issued 
new 
industry 
guidance 
that 
limits 
a 
BHC
™
s 
ability 
to 
make 
capital 
distributions 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
its 
actual 
capital 
issuances, 
including 
employee 
share-based 
compensation, 
are 
less 
than 
the 
amount 
indicated 
in 
its 
submitted 
capital 
plan. 
Given 
this 
new 
guidance 
and 
our 
revised 
forecast 
for 
employee-related 
share-
based 
compensation, 
our 
planned 
share 
repurchases 
through 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015 
will 
be 
approximately 
$50 
million 
lower 
than 
the 
$450 
million 
maximum 
in 
our 
2014 
capital 
plan. 
The 
drivers 
of 
the 
lower 
than 
planned 
capital 
issuance 
include 
changes 
in 
employee 
option 
exercises 
relative 
to 
forecast 
and 
a 
valuation 
adjustment 
to 
our 
noncontrolling 
interest 
in 
RidgeW
orth. 
The 
net 
share 
dilution 
impact 
from 
this 
change 
is 
immaterial.
During 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
we 
repurchased 
$50 
million
 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock, 
which 
completed 
our 
authorized 
share 
repurchases 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
2013 
capital 
plan. 
During 
the 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth 
quarters 
we 
repurchased 
$278 
million
 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
2014 
capital 
plan. 
Additionally
, 
thus 
far 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015, 
we 
repurchased 
$50 
million
 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
at 
market 
value 
and 
we 
expect 
to 
repurchase 
between 
$60 
million
 
and 
$70 
million
 
of 
additional 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
through 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015, 
which 
would 
complete 
the 
repurchase 
of 
authorized 
shares 
as 
approved 
by 
the 
Board
 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
2014 
capital 
plan.
During 
the 
third 
quarter 
we 
recorded 
a 
$130 
million
 
tax 
benefit 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
completion 
of 
a 
tax 
authority 
examination. 
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 
did 
not 
object 
to 
us 
utilizing 
this 
gain 
to 
repurchase 
additional 
common 
stock 
and, 
as 
a 
result, 
we 
repurchased 
an 
additional 
$130 
million
 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
during 
that 
quarter
. 
The 
purchase 
of 
this 
additional 
common 
stock 
was 
incremental 
to 
the 
existing 
availability 
previously 
noted 
under 
our 
2014 
capital 
plan.

plus 
3.86%. 
W
e 
will 
accrue 
for

on 
these

By

CRITICAL
 
ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
Our 
significant 
accounting 
policies 
are 
described 
in

in 
Note

, 
ﬁSignificant 
Accounting 
Policies,ﬂ 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
in 
this 
Form 
10-K 
and 
are 
integral 
to 
understanding 
our 
financial 
performance. 
W
e 
have 
identified 
certain 
accounting 
policies 
as 
being 
critical 
because 
(1) 
they 
require 
judgment 
about 
matters 
that 
are 
highly 
uncertain 
and 
(2) 
dif
ferent 
estimates 
that 
could 
be 
reasonably 
applied 
would 
result 
in 
materially 
dif
ferent 
assessments 
with 
respect 
to 
ascertaining 
the 
valuation 
of 
assets, 
liabilities, 
commitments, 
and 
contingencies. 
A
 
variety 
of 
factors 
could 
af
fect 
the 
ultimate 
value 
that 
is 
obtained 
either 
when 
earning 
income, 
recognizing 
an 
expense, 
recovering 
an 
asset, 
and 
valuing 
an 
asset 
or 
liability
. 
Our 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
policies 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
U.S. 
GAAP
, 
and 
they 
conform 
to 
general 
practices 
within 
the 
financial 
services 
industry
. 
W
e 
have 
established 
detailed 
policies 
and 
control 
procedures 
that 
are 
intended 
to 
ensure 
that 
these 
critical 
accounting 
estimates 
are 
well 
controlled 
and 
applied 
consistently 
from 
period 
to 
period, 
and 
that 
the 
process 
for 
changing 
methodologies 
occurs 
in 
an 
appropriate 
manner
. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
description 
of 
our 
current 
critical 
accounting 
policies.
Contingencies
W
e 
face 
uncertainty 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
ultimate 
outcomes 
of 
various 
contingencies 
including 
the 
Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses, 
mortgage 
repurchase 
reserves, 
and 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
matters.
Allowance for
 Cr
edit Losses
The 
Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses 
is 
composed 
of 
the 
ALLL
 
and 
the 
reserve 
for 
unfunded 
commitments. 
The 
ALLL
 
represents 
our 
estimate 
of 
probable 
losses 
inherent 
in 
the 
LHFI 
portfolio. 
The 
ALLL
 
is 
increased 
by 
the 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
and 
reduced 
by 
loans 
char
ged 
of
f, 
net 
of 
recoveries. 
The 
ALLL
 
is 
determined 
based 
on 
our 
review 
and 
evaluation 
of 
lar
ger 
loans 
that 
meet 
our 
definition 
of 
impairment 
and 
the

of 
homogeneous 
loans 
(i.e., 
loans 
having

the 
historical 
loss, 
risk-rating, 
or 
other 
indicative 
data.
Lar
ge 
commercial 
nonaccrual 
loans 
and 
certain 
commercial, 
consumer
, 
and 
residential 
loans 
whose 
terms 
have 
been 
modified 
in 
a 
TDR, 
are 
individually 
evaluated 
to 
determine 
the 
amount 
of 
specific 
allowance 
required 
using 
the 
most 
probable 
source 
of 
repayment, 
including 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
loan's 
expected 
future 
cash 
flows, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
underlying 
collateral 
less 
costs 
of 
disposition, 
or 
the 
loan's 
estimated 
market 
value. 
In 
these 
measurements, 
we 
use 
assumptions 
and 
methodologies 
that 
are 
relevant 
to 
estimating 
the 
level 
of 
impairment 
and 
unrealized 
losses 
in 
the 
portfolio. 
T
o 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
data 
supporting 
such 
assumptions 
has 
limitations, 
our 
judgment 
and 
experience 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
enhancing 
the 
specific 
ALLL
 
estimates. 
Key 
judgments 
used 
in 
determining 
the 
ALLL
 
include 
internal 
risk 
ratings, 
market 
and 
collateral 
values, 
discount 
rates, 
loss 
rates, 
and 
our 
view 
of 
current 
economic 
conditions.
General 
allowances 
are 
established 
for 
loans 
and 
leases 
grouped 
into 
pools 
that 
have 
similar 
characteristics, 
including 
smaller 
balance 
homogeneous 
loans. 
The 
ALLL
 
Committee 
estimates 
probable 
losses 
by 
evaluating 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
factors 
for 
each 
loan 
portfolio 
segment, 
including 
net 
char
ge-of
f 
trends, 
internal 
risk 
ratings, 
changes 
in 
internal 
risk 
ratings, 
loss 
forecasts, 
collateral 
values, 
geographic 
location, 
delinquency 
rates, 
nonperforming 
and 
restructured 
loans, 
origination 
channel, 
product 
mix, 
underwriting 
practices, 
industry 
conditions, 
and 
economic 
trends. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
factors, 
the 
consumer 
and 
residential 
portfolio 
segments 
consider 
borrower 
FICO 
scores 
and 
the 
commercial 
portfolio 
segment 
considers 
single 
name 
borrower 
concentration.
Estimated 
collateral 
valuations 
are 
based 
on 
appraisals, 
broker 
price 
opinions, 
recent 
sales 
of 
foreclosed 
properties, 
automated 
valuation 
models, 
other 
property-specific 
information, 
and 
relevant 
market 
information, 
supplemented 
by 
our 
internal 
property 
valuation 
professionals. 
The 
value 
estimate 
is 
based 
on 
an 
orderly 
disposition 
and 
marketing 
period 
of 
the 
property
. 
In 
limited 
instances, 
we 
adjust 
externally 
provided 
appraisals 
for 
justifiable 
and 
well 
supported 
reasons, 
such 
as 
an 
appraiser 
not 
being 
aware 
of 
certain 
property-specific 
factors 
or 
recent 
sales 
information. 
Appraisals 
generally 
represent 
the 
ﬁas 
isﬂ 
value 
of 
the 
property 
but 
may 
be 
adjusted 
based 
on 
the 
intended 
disposition 
strategy 
of 
the 
property
.
Our 
determination 
of 
the 
ALLL
 
for 
commercial 
loans 
is 
sensitive 
to 
the 
assigned 
internal 
risk 
ratings 
and 
inherent 
loss 
rates 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
Assuming 
a 
downgrade 
of 
one 
level 
in 
the 
PD 
risk 
ratings 
for 
all 
commercial 
loans 
and 
leases, 
the 
ALLL
 
would 
have 
increased 
by 
approximately 
$349 
million 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
estimated 
loss 
severity 
rates 
for 
the 
entire 
commercial 
loan 
portfolio 
increased 
by 
10 
percent, 
the 
ALLL
 
for 
the 
commercial 
portfolio 
would 
increase 
by 
approximately 
$97 
million 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
Our 
determination 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
residential 
and 
consumer 
loans 
is 
also 
sensitive 
to 
changes 
in 
estimated 
loss 
severity 
rates. 
In 
the 
event 
that 
estimated 
loss 
severity 
rates 
for 
the 
residential 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolio 
increased 
by 
10 
percent, 
the 
ALLL
 
for 
the 
residential 
and 
consumer 
portfolios 
would 
increase, 
in 
total, 
by 
approximately 
$65 
million 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
Because 
several 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative 
factors 
are 
considered 
in 
determining 
the 
ALLL, 
these 
sensitivity 
analyses 
do 
not 
necessarily 
reflect 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
future 
changes 
in 
the 
ALLL. 
They 
are 
intended 
to 
provide 
insights 
into 
the 
impact 
of 
adverse 
changes 
in 
risk 
rating 
and 
estimated 
loss 
severity 
rates 
and 
do 
not 
imply 
any 
expectation 
of 
future 
deterioration 
in 
the 
risk 
ratings 
or 
loss 
rates. 
Given 
current 
processes 
employed, 
management 
believes 
the 
risk 
ratings 
and 
inherent 
loss 
rates 
currently 
assigned 
are 
appropriate. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
others, 
given 
the 
same 
information, 
may 
at 
any 
point 
in 
time 
reach 
dif
ferent 
reasonable 
conclusions 
that 
could 
be 
material 
to 
our 
financial 
statements. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
ALLL, 
we 
also 
estimate 
probable 
losses 
related 
to 
unfunded 
lending 
commitments, 
such 
as 
letters 
of 
credit 
and 
binding 
unfunded 
loan 
commitments. 
Unfunded 
lending 
commitments 
are 
analyzed 
and 
segregated 
by 
risk 
52
similarly 
to 
funded 
loans 
based 
on 
our 
internal 
risk 
rating 
scale. 
These 
risk 
classifications, 
in 
combination 
with 
an 
analysis 
of 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
probability 
of 
commitment 
usage, 
and 
any 
other 
pertinent 
information, 
result 
in 
the 
estimation 
of 
the 
reserve 
for 
unfunded 
lending 
commitments.
Our 
financial 
results 
are 
af
fected 
by 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses. 
This 
process 
involves 
our 
analysis 
of 
complex 
internal 
and 
external 
variables, 
and 
it 
requires 
that 
we 
exercise 
judgment 
to 
estimate 
an 
appropriate 
Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
associated 
with 
this 
subjectivity
, 
we 
cannot 
assure 
the 
precision 
of 
the 
amount 
reserved 
should 
we 
experience 
sizeable 
loan 
or 
lease 
losses 
in 
any 
particular 
period. 
For 
example, 
changes 
in 
the 
financial 
condition 
of 
individual 
borrowers, 
economic 
conditions, 
or 
the 
condition 
of 
various 
markets 
in 
which 
collateral 
may 
be 
sold 
could 
require 
us 
to 
significantly 
decrease 
or 
increase 
the 
level 
of 
the 
Allowance 
for 
Credit 
Losses. 
Such 
an 
adjustment 
could 
materially 
af
fect 
net 
income 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
change 
in 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses.

Mortgage Repur
chase Reserve
W
e 
sell 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
to 
investors 
through 
whole 
loan 
sales 
in 
the 
normal 
course 
of 
our 
business. 
The 
investors 
are 
primarily 
GSE
s; 
however
, 
$30 
billion
, 
or 
approximately 
10%, 
of 
the 
population 
of 
total 
loans 
sold 
between 
January 
1, 
2005 
and 
December€31, 
2014
 
were 
sold 
to 
non-agency 
investors, 
some 
in 
the 
form 
of 
securitizations. 
In 
association 
with 
these 
transactions, 
we 
provide 
representations 
and 
warranties 
to 
the 
third 
party 
investors 
that 
these 
loans 
meet 
certain 
requirements 
as 
agreed 
to 
in 
investor 
guidelines. 
W
e 
have 
experienced 
significantly 
fewer 
repurchase 
claims 
and 
losses 
related 
to 
loans 
sold 
since 
2009 
as 
a 
result 
of 
stronger 
credit 
performance, 
more 
stringent 
credit 
guidelines, 
and 
underwriting 
process 
improvements.
During 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2013, 
we 
reached 
agreements 
with 
Freddie 
Mac 
and 
Fannie 
Mae 
under 
which 
they 
released 
us 
from 
certain 
existing 
and 
future 
repurchase 
obligations 
for 
loans 
funded 
by 
Freddie 
Mac 
between 
2000 
and 
2008 
and 
Fannie 
Mae 
between 
2000 
and 
2012. 
Our 
current 
estimated 
liability 
for 
contingent 
losses 
related 
to 
loans 
sold 
(i.e., 
our 
mortgage 
repurchase 
reserve) 
was 
$85 
million 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
liability 
is 
recorded 
in 
other 
liabilities 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets, 
and 
the 
related 
repurchase 
provision 
is 
recognized 
in 
mortgage 
production 
related 
income 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income. 
The 
current 
reserves 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
suf
ficient 
to 
cover 
probable 
estimated 
losses 
related 
to 
exclusions 
due 
to 
certain 
defects 
(
MI
 
related 
reasons, 
excessive 
seller 
contribution, 
ineligible 
property 
and 
other 
charter 
violations) 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
settlement 
contract, 
GSE
 
owned 
loans 
serviced 
by 
third 
party 
servicers, 
loans 
sold 
to 
private 
investors, 
and 
future 
indemnifications.
V
arious 
factors 
could 
potentially 
impact 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
assumptions 
underlying 
our 
mortgage 
repurchase 
reserve 
estimate. 
As 
previously 
discussed, 
the 
level 
of 
repurchase 
requests 
we 
receive 
is 
dependent 
upon 
the 
actions 
of 
third 
parties 
and 
could 
dif
fer 
from 
the 
assumptions 
that 
we 
have 
made.
 
Delinquency 
levels, 
delinquency 
roll 
rates, 
and 
our 
loss 
severity 
assumptions 
are 
all 
highly 
dependent 
upon 
economic 
factors 
including 
changes 
in 
real 
estate 
values 
and 
unemployment 
levels 
which 
are, 
by 
nature, 
dif
ficult 
to 
predict. 
Loss 
severity 
assumptions 
could 
also 
be 
negatively 
impacted 
by 
delays 
in 
the 
foreclosure 
process, 
which 
is 
a 
heightened 
risk 
in 
some 
of 
the 
states 
where 
our 
loans 
sold 
were 
originated. 
Moreover
, 
the 
2013 
agreements 
with 
Fannie 
Mae 
and 
Freddie 
Mac 
settling 
certain 
aspects 
of 
our 
repurchase 
obligations 
preserve 
their 
right 
to 
require 
repurchases 
arising 
from 
certain 
types 
of 
events, 
and 
that 
preservation 
of 
rights 
can 
impact 
our 
future 
losses. 
While 
the 
repurchase 
reserve 
includes 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
settling 
claims 
related 
to 
required 
repurchases, 
our 
estimate 
of 
losses 
depends 
on 
our 
assumptions 
regarding 
GSE
 
and 
other 
counterparty 
behavior
, 
loan 
performance, 
home 
prices, 
and 
other 
factors. 
While 
we 
have 
used 
the 
best 
information 
available 
in 
estimating 
the 
mortgage 
repurchase 
reserve 
liability
, 
these 
and 
other 
factors, 
along 
with 
the 
discovery 
of 
additional 
information 
in 
the 
future 
could 
result 
in 
changes 
in 
our 
assumptions 
which 
could 
materially 
impact 
our 
results 
of 
operations.

Legal and Regulatory Matters
W
e 
are 
parties 
to 
numerous 
claims 
and 
lawsuits 
arising 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
normal 
business 
activities, 
some 
of 
which 
involve 
claims 
for 
substantial 
amounts, 
and 
the 
outcomes 
of 
which 
are 
not 
within 
our 
complete 
control 
or 
may 
not 
be 
known 
for 
prolonged 
periods 
of 
time. 
Management 
is 
required 
to 
assess 
the 
probability 
of 
loss 
and 
amount 
of 
such 
loss, 
if 
any
, 
in 
preparing 
our 
financial 
statements.
W
e 
evaluate 
the 
likelihood 
of 
a 
potential 
loss 
from 
legal 
or 
regulatory 
proceedings 
to 
which 
we 
are 
a 
party
. 
W
e 
record 
a 
liability 
for 
such 
claims 
only 
when 
a 
loss 
is 
considered 
probable 
and 
the 
amount 
can 
be 
reasonably 
estimated. 
The 
liability 
is 
recorded 
in 
other 
liabilities 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets 
and 
related 
expense 
is 
recorded 
in 
the 
applicable 
category 
of 
noninterest 
expense, 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
legal 
matter
, 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income. 
Significant 
judgment 
may 
be 
required 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
both 
probability 
of 
loss 
and 
whether 
an 
exposure 
is 
reasonably 
estimable. 
Our 
estimates 
are 
subjective 
based 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
legal 
or 
regulatory 
proceedings, 
the 
merits 
of 
our 
defenses, 
and 
consultation 
with 
in-house 
and 
outside 
legal 
counsel. 
In 
many 
such 
proceedings, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
determine 
whether 
a 
liability 
has 
been 
incurred 
or 
to 
estimate 
the 
ultimate 
or 
minimum 
amount 
of 
that 
liability 
until 
the 
matter 
is 
close 
to 
resolution. 
As 
additional 
information 
becomes 
available, 
we 
reassess 
the 
potential 
liability 
related 
to 
pending 
claims 
and 
may 
revise 
our 
estimates.
Due 
to 
the 
inherent 
uncertainties 
of 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
processes 
in 
the 
multiple 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
we 
operate, 
our 
estimates 
may 
be 
materially 
dif
ferent 
than 
the 
actual 
outcomes, 
which 
could 
have 
material 
ef
fects 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition, 
and 
results 
of 
operations.

Estimates 
of 
Fair 
V
alue
Fair 
value 
is 
the 
price 
that 
could 
be 
received 
to 
sell 
an 
asset 
or 
paid 
to 
transfer 
a 
liability 
in 
an 
orderly 
transaction 
between 
53
market 
participants. 
The 
objective 
of 
fair 
value 
is 
to 
use 
market-
based 
inputs 
or 
assumptions, 
when 
available, 
to 
estimate 
the 
price 
that 
would 
be 
received 
to 
sell 
an 
asset 
or 
paid 
to 
transfer 
a 
liability 
in 
an 
orderly 
transaction 
between 
market 
participants 
at 
the 
measurement 
date. 
Where 
observable 
market 
prices 
from 
transactions 
for 
identical 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
are 
not 
available, 
we 
identify 
what 
we 
believe 
to 
be 
similar 
assets 
or 
liabilities. 
If 
observable 
market 
prices 
are 
unavailable 
or 
impracticable 
to 
obtain 
for 
any 
such 
similar 
assets 
or 
liabilities, 
we 
look 
to 
other 
techniques 
by 
obtaining 
third 
party 
quotes 
or 
using 
modeling 
techniques, 
such 
as 
discounted 
cash 
flows, 
while 
attempting 
to 
utilize 
market 
observable 
assumptions 
to 
the 
extent 
available. 
Absent 
current 
market 
activity 
in 
that 
specific 
instrument 
or 
a 
similar 
instrument, 
the 
resulting 
valuation 
approach 
may 
require 
making 
a 
number 
of 
significant 
judgments 
in 
the 
estimation 
of 
fair 
value. 
Market 
conditions 
during 
the 
credit 
crisis 
led 
to 
limited 
or 
nonexistent 
trading 
in 
certain 
of 
the 
financial 
asset 
classes 
that 
we 
have 
owned. 
Although 
market 
conditions 
have 
improved 
and 
we 
have 
seen 
the 
return 
of 
liquidity 
in 
certain 
markets, 
we 
continue 
to 
experience 
a 
low 
level 
of 
activity 
in 
certain 
markets 
and 
also 
hold 
a 
limited 
amount 
of 
instruments 
that 
do 
not 
have 
an 
active 
market, 
which 
creates 
additional 
challenges 
when 
estimating 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
these 
financial 
instruments.
Generally
, 
the 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
most 
af
fected 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
liquidity 
or

market 
are 
those 
required 
to 
be 
classified 
as 
level 
3 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
hierarchy
. 
As 
a 
result, 
various 
processes 
and 
controls 
have 
been 
adopted 
to 
determine 
that 
appropriate 
methodologies, 
techniques, 
and 
assumptions 
are 
used 
in 
the 
development 
of 
fair 
value 
estimates, 
particularly 
related 
to 
those 
instruments 
that 
require 
the 
use 
of 
significant, 
unobservable 
inputs. 
W
e 
continue 
to 
maintain 
a 
cross-functional 
approach 
when 
estimating 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
these 
dif
ficult 
to 
value 
financial 
instruments. 
This 
includes 
input 
from 
not 
only 
the 
related 
line 
of 
business, 
but 
also 
from 
risk 
management 
and 
finance, 
to 
ultimately 
arrive 
at 
a 
consensus 
estimate 
of 
the 
instrument's 
fair 
value 
after 
evaluating 
all 
available 
information 
pertaining 
to 
fair 
value. 
This 
process 
involves 
the 
gathering 
of 
multiple 
sources 
of 
information, 
including 
broker 
quotes, 
values 
provided 
by 
pricing 
services, 
trading 
activity 
in 
other 
similar 
instruments, 
market 
indices, 
and 
pricing 
matrices 
along 
with 
employing 
various 
modeling 
techniques, 
such 
as 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
analyses, 
in 
arriving 
at 
the 
best 
estimate 
of 
fair 
value. 
Modeling 
techniques 
incorporate 
our 
assessments 
regarding 
assumptions 
that 
market 
participants 
would 
use 
in 
pricing 
the 
asset 
or 
the 
liability
, 
including 
market-based 
assumptions, 
such 
as 
interest 
rates, 
as 
well 
as 
assumptions 
about 
the 
risks 
inherent 
in 
a 
particular 
valuation 
technique, 
the 
ef
fect 
of 
a 
restriction 
on 
the 
sale 
or 
use 
of 
an 
asset, 
market 
liquidity
, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
nonperformance. 
In 
certain 
cases, 
our 
assessments 
with 
respect 
to 
assumptions 
that 
market 
participants 
would 
make 
may 
be 
inherently 
dif

to 
determine, 
and 
the 
use 
of

T
rading 
and 
Derivative 
Assets 
and 
Liabilities 
and 
Securities 
AFS
In 
estimating 
the 
fair 
values 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
securities 
AFS 
and 
trading 
instruments, 
including 
residual 
and 
certain 
other 
retained 
securitization 
interests, 
fair 
values 
are 
based 
on 
observable 
market 
prices 
of 
the 
same 
or 
similar 
instruments. 
Specifically
, 
the 
majority 
of 
trading 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
priced 
by 
the 
respective 
trading 
desk 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
securities 
AFS 
are 
priced 
by 
an 
independent 
third 
party 
pricing 
service. 
W
e 
have 
an 
internal, 
yet 
independent, 
validation 
function 
in 
place 
to 
evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
values 
received 
from 
the 
trading 
desk 
and/or 
third 
party 
pricing 
services. 
For 
trading 
securities 
and 
securities 
AFS 
in 
active 
trading 
markets, 
this 
can 
be 
accomplished 
by 
comparing 
the 
values 
against 
two 
to 
three 
other 
widely 
used 
third 
party 
pricing 
services 
or 
sources. 
For 
less 
liquid 
instruments, 
we 
evaluate 
third 
party 
pricing 
to 
determine 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
information 
relative 
to 
changes 
in 
market 
data 
such 
as 
any 
recent 
trades 
we 
54
executed, 
market 
information 
received 
from 
outside 
market 
participants 
and 
analysts, 
and/or 
changes 
in 
the 
underlying 
collateral 
performance.
W
e 
also 
gather 
third 
party 
broker 
quotes 
or 
use 
industry-
standard 
or 
proprietary 
models 
to 
estimate 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
these 
instruments 
particularly 
when 
pricing 
service 
information 
or 
observable 
market 
trades 
are 
not 
available. 
In 
most 
cases, 
the 
current 
market 
conditions 
cause 
the 
broker 
quotes 
to 
be 
indicative 
and 
the 
price 
indications 
and 
broker 
quotes 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
very 
limited 
to 
no 
recent 
market 
activity
. 
In 
those 
instances, 
we 
weighted 
the 
third 
party 
information 
according 
to 
our 
judgment 
of 
it 
being 
a 
reasonable 
indication 
of 
the 
instrument's 
fair 
value.
When 
fair 
values 
are 
estimated 
based 
on 
models, 
we 
consider 
relevant 
market 
indices 
that 
correlate 
to 
the 
underlying 
collateral, 
along 
with 
assumptions 
such 
as 
liquidity 
discounts, 
interest 
rates, 
prepayment 
speeds, 
default 
rates, 
loss 
severity 
rates, 
and 
discount 
rates. 
In 
markets 
with 
higher 
liquidity
, 
we 
have 
more 
pricing 
information 
from 
third 
parties 
and 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
need 
to 
use 
internal 
pricing 
models 
to 
estimate 
fair 
value. 
Even 
when 
third 
party 
pricing 
is 
available, 
we 
continued 
to 
classify 
certain 
assets 
as 
level 
3 
as 
we 
believe 
that 
this 
third 
party 
pricing 
relied 
on 
significant 
unobservable 
assumptions, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
a 
persistently 
wide 
bid-ask 
price 
range 
and 
variability 
in 
pricing 
from 
the 
pricing 
services, 
particularly 
for 
the 
vintages 
and 
exposures 
we 
hold.
As 
certain 
markets 
recover
, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
reduce 
our 
exposure 
to 
many 
of 
our 
level 
3 
instruments 
through 
sales, 
maturities, 
or 
other 
distributions 
at 
prices 
approximating 
our 
previous 
estimates, 
thereby 
corroborating 
the 
valuation 
approaches 
used. 
All 
of 
the 
techniques 
used 
and 
information 
obtained 
in 
the 
valuation 
process 
provide 
a 
range 
of 
estimated 
values, 
which 
were 
evaluated 
and 
compared 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
an 
estimated 
value 
that, 
based 
on 
management's 
judgment, 
represented 
a 
reasonable 
estimate 
of 
the 
instrument's 
fair 
value. 
It 
was 
not 
uncommon 
for 
the 
range 
of 
value 
of 
these 
instruments 
to 
vary 
widely; 
in 
such 
cases, 
we 
selected 
an 
estimated 
value 
that 
we 
believed 
was 
the 
best 
indication 
of 
value 
based 
on 
the 
yield 
a 
market 
participant 
in 
this 
current 
environment 
would 
expect. 
Due 
to 
the 
continued 
illiquidity 
and 
credit 
risk 
of 
level 
3 
securities, 
these 
market 
values 
are 
highly 
sensitive 
to 
assumption 
changes 
and 
market 
volatility
. 
Improvements 
may 
be 
made 
to 
our 
pricing 
methodologies 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis 
as 
observable 
and 
relevant 
information 
becomes 
available 
to 
us. 
Most 
derivative 
instruments 
are 
level 
1 
or 
level 
2 
instruments, 
except 
for 
the 
IRLC
s 
and

are

discussion 
regarding 
derivative 
contracts 
and 
valuation.
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
level 
3 
trading 
assets 
and 
derivatives 
and 
level 
3 
securities 
AFS 
totaled 
$25 
million
 
and 
$946 
million
, 
respectively
. 
Our 
level 
3 
securities 
AFS 
portfolio 
included 
FHLB 
and 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank 
stock, 
as 
well 
as 
certain 
municipal 
bond 
securities, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
only 
redeemable 
with 
the 
issuer 
at 
par 
and 
cannot 
be 
traded 
in 
the 
market; 
as 
such, 
no 
significant 
observable 
market 
data 
for 
these 
instruments 
is 
available. 
These 
nonmarketable 
securities 
AFS 
totaled 
approximately 
$797 
million 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
remaining 
level 
3 
securities, 
both 
trading 
assets 
and 
securities 
AFS, 
are 
predominantly 
private 
ABS 
and 
MBS, 
including 
interests 
retained 
from 
Company-sponsored 
securitizations 
or 
purchased 
from 
third 
party 
securitizations. 
For 
all 
level 
3 
securities, 
little 
or 
no 
market 
activity 
exists 
for 
either 
the 
security 
or 
the 
underlying 
collateral 
and 
therefore, 
the 
significant 
assumptions 
used 
to 
value 
the 
securities 
are 
not 
market 
observable.
Level 
3 
trading 
assets 
and 
derivatives 
decreased 
by 
$47 
million, 
or 
65%, 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December€31, 
2014
, 
primarily 
due 
to 
sales 
of 
securities. 
Level 
3 
securities 
AFS 
decreased 
by 
$7 
million
, 
or 
1%, 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December€31, 
2014
 
due 
to 
continued 
paydowns 
and 
sales 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
purchases. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
December€31, 
2014
, 
we 
recognized 
$264 
million
 
in 
net 
gains 
through 
earnings 
related 
to 
trading 
and 
derivative 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
classified 
as 
level 
3, 
primarily 
due 
to 
$252 
million
 
in 
IRLC 
related 
gains 
and 
$12 
million
 
in 
net 
gains 
from 
trading 
securities. 
Loans
The 
fair 
values 
of 
LHFI 
and 
LHFS 
are 
based 
on 
observable 
current 
market 
prices 
in 
the 
secondary 
loan 
market 
in 
which 
loans 
trade, 
as 
either 
whole 
loans 
or 
as 
ABS. 
When 
security 
prices 
are 
obtained 
in 
the 
secondary 
loan 
market, 
we 
will 
translate 
these 
prices 
into 
whole 
loan 
prices 
by 
incorporating 
adjustments 
for 
estimated 
credit 
enhancement 
costs, 
loan 
servicing 
fees, 
and 
various 
other 
transformation 
costs, 
when 
material. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
loan 
is 
impacted 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
asset 
and 
the 
market 
liquidity
. 
Level 
3 
loans 
are 
predominantly 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
have 
been 
deemed 
not 
marketable, 
lar
gely 
due 
to 
borrower 
defaults 
or 
the 
identification 
of 
other 
loan 
defects. 
When 
estimating 
fair 
value 
for 
these 
loans, 
we 
use 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
approach 
based 
on 
assumptions 
that 
are 
generally 
not 
observable 
in 
the 
current 
markets, 
such 
as 
prepayment 
speeds, 
default 
rates, 
loss 
severity 
rates, 
and 
liquidity 
discounts. 
Absent 
comparable 
current 
market 
data, 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
fair 
value 
derived 
from 
these 
various 
approaches 
is 
a 
reasonable 
approximation 
of 
the 
prices 
that 
we 
would 
receive 
upon 
sale 
of 
the 
loans.

based 
on

into 
account 
hedging 
activities

ﬁOther

section 
of 
this 
MD&A.
The 
fair 
values 
of 
OREO 
and 
other 
repossessed 
assets 
are 
measured 
on 
a 
non-recurring 
basis 
and 
are 
typically 
determined 
based 
on 
recent 
appraisals 
by 
third 
parties 
and 
other 
market 
information. 
Our 
OREO 
properties 
are 
concentrated 
in

Florida, 
and 
North 
Carolina. 
Further 
deterioration 
in 
property 
values 
in 
those 
states 
or 
changes

values

decline 
which 
would 
result 
in 
further 
write-downs.

Estimates 
of 
fair 
value 
are 
also 
required 
when 
performing 
an 
impairment 
analysis 
of 
goodwill, 
intangible 
assets, 
and 
long-
lived 
assets. 
For 
long-lived 
assets, 
including 
intangible 
assets 
subject 
to 
amortization, 
an 
impairment 
loss 
is 
recognized 
if 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
the 
asset 
is 
not 
recoverable 
and 
exceeds 
its 
fair 
value. 
In 
determining 
the 
fair 
value, 
management 
uses 
models 
which 
require 
assumptions 
about 
growth 
rates, 
the 
life 
of 
the 
asset, 
and/or 
the 
market 
value 
of 
the 
assets. 
W

long-

W

review 
goodwill 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit 
for 
impairment 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
or 
more 
often, 
if 
events 
or 
circumstances 
indicate 
that 
it 
is 
more-likely-than-not 
that 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
reporting 
unit 
is 
below 
the 
carrying 
value 
of 
its 
equity
. 
Our 
goodwill 
impairment 
test 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2014 
resulted 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
fair 
value 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
carrying 
value 
for 
the 
Consumer 
Banking/Private 
W
ealth 
Management 
reporting 
unit 
and 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
excess 
fair 
value 
related 
to 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit 
compared 
to 
the 
2013 
test 
results. 
Due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
carrying 
value 
of 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
we 
elected 
to 
perform 
an 
interim 
goodwill 
impairment 
analysis 
for 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2014.
The 
carrying 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
is 
determined 
by 
allocating 
the 
total 
equity 
of 
the 
Company 
to 
each 
of 
its 
reporting 
units 
based 
on 
an 
equal 
weighting 
of 
regulatory 
risk-based 
capital 
and 
an 
approach 
based 
on 
tangible 
equity 
relative 
to 
tangible 
assets. 
A
 
portion 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
equity 
is 
assigned 
to 
the 
Corporate 
Other 
operating 
segment, 
which 
is 
attributed 
to 
the 
corporate 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
assigned 
to 
that 
segment 
that 
do 
not 
relate 
to 
the 
operations 
of 
any 
reporting 
unit.
The 
goodwill 
impairment 
analysis 
estimates 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
equity 
using 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
analyses 
which 
require 
assumptions, 
as 
well 
as 
guideline 
company 
information, 
where 
available. 
The 
inputs 
and 
assumptions 
specific 
to 
each 
reporting 
unit 
are 
incorporated 
in 
the 
valuations, 
including 
projections 
of 
future 
cash 
flows, 
discount 
rates, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
tangible 
assets 
and 
intangible 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
and 
applicable 
valuation 
multiples 
based 
on 
the 
guideline 
information. 
W
e 
assess 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
reporting 
units 
by 
giving 
consideration 
to 
our 
market 
capitalization 
over 
a 
reasonable 
period 
of 
time; 
however
, 
supplemental 
information 
is 
applied 
based 
on 
observable 
multiples 
from 
guideline 
companies. 
Based 
on 
our 
annual 
impairment 
analysis 
of 
goodwill 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
we 
determined 
for 
the 
Consumer 
Banking/Private 
W
ealth 
Management 
and 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
units 
that 
the 
respective 
reporting 
unit's 
fair 
value 
was 
in 
excess 
of 
its 
carrying 
value 
by 
the 
following 
percentages:

Based 
on 
our 
interim 
goodwill 
analysis 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2014 
for 
the 
Wholesale 
reporting 
unit, 
we 
determined 
that 
the 
fair 
value 
in 
excess 
of 
carrying 
value 
decreased 
to 
7%. 
The 
carrying 
value 
allocated 
to 
the 
Wholesale 
reporting 
unit 
increased 
based 
on 
both 
asset 
growth 
within 
the 
reporting 
unit 
and 
increased 
total 
equity 
of 
the 
Company
. 
There 
was 
not 
a 
commensurate 
increase 
in 
fair 
value 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
forecast 
inputs 
including 
expectations 
of 
lower 
forward 
interest 
rates 
and 
other 
reporting 
unit 
specific 
matters. 
Circumstances 
that 
could 
negatively 
impact 
the 
fair 
value 
in 
excess 
of 
carrying 
value 
for 
the 
Wholesale 
reporting 
unit 
in 
the 
future 
include 
significant 
growth 
in 
assets, 
growth 
in 
the 
Company™
s 
total 
equity
, 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
applicable 
discount 
rate, 
or 
deterioration 
in 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit™
s 
forecasts.
Multi-year 
financial 
forecasts 
are 
developed 
for 
each 
reporting 
unit 
by 
considering 
several 
key 
business 
drivers 
such 
as 
new 
business 
initiatives, 
client 
service 
and 
retention 
standards, 
market 
share 
changes, 
anticipated 
loan 
and 
deposit 
growth, 
forward 
interest 
rates, 
historical 
performance, 
and 
industry 
and 
economic 
trends, 
among 
other 
considerations. 
The 
long-term 
growth 
rate 
used 
in 
determining 
the 
terminal 
value 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit 
was 
estimated 
at 
3.4% 
as 
of 
December€31, 
2014
, 
September 
30, 
2014 
and 
September 
30, 
2013, 
based 
on 
management's 
assessment 
of 
the 
minimum 
expected 
terminal 
growth 
rate 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit, 
as 
well 
as 
broader 
economic 
considerations 
such 
as 
gross 
domestic 
product 
and 
inflation.
Discount 
rates 
are 
estimated 
based 
on 
the 
Capital 
Asset 
Pricing 
Model, 
which 
considers 
the 
risk-free 
interest 
rate, 
market 
risk 
premium, 
beta, 
and 
unsystematic 
risk 
adjustments 
specific 
to 
a 
particular 
reporting 
unit. 
The 
discount 
rates 
are 
also 
calibrated 
based 
on 
risks 
related 
to 
the 
projected 
cash 
flows 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit. 
The 
discount 
rate 
utilized 
for 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
September 
30, 
2014 
was 
1
1.1%. 
In 
the 
annual 
analysis 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2014, 
the 
discount 
rate 
for 
the 
Consumer 
Banking/Private 
W
ealth 
Management 
reporting 
unit 
was 
approximately 
1
1.6%. 
In 
the 
annual 
analysis 
at 
September 
30, 
2013, 
the 
discount 
rates 
for 
the 
Consumer 
Banking/Private 
W
ealth 
Management 
and 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
units 
were 
13.1% 
and 
13.3%, 
respectively
. 
The 
discount 
rates 
at 
September 
30, 
2014 
were 
lower 
than 
September 
30, 
2013 
due 
to 
a 
combination 
of 
decreases 
in 
Capital 
Asset 
Pricing 
Model 
inputs 
including 
the 
risk-free 
interest 
rate, 
market 
risk 
premium, 
and 
beta, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
unsystematic 
risk 
adjustments 
specific 
to 
each 
reporting 
unit.
The 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
valuation 
techniques 
described 
above 
and 
is 
analyzed 
56
in 
relation 
to 
numerous 
market 
and 
historical 
factors, 
including 
current 
economic 
and 
market 
conditions, 
company-specific 
growth 
opportunities, 
and 
guideline 
company 
information.
Economic 
and 
market 
conditions 
can 
vary 
significantly 
which 
may 
cause 
increased 
volatility 
in 
a 
company's 
stock 
price, 
resulting 
in 
a 
temporary 
decline 
in 
market 
capitalization. 
In 
those 
circumstances, 
current 
market 
capitalization 
may 
not 
be 
an 
accurate 
indication 
of 
a 
market 
participant's 
estimate 
of 
entity-
specific 
value 
measured 
over 
a 
reasonable 
period 
of 
time. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
use 
of 
market 
capitalization 
may 
be 
a 
less 
relevant 
measure 
in 
assessing 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
aggregate 
value 
of 
the 
reporting 
units. 
Therefore, 
the 
Company 
supplements 
market 
capitalization 
information 
with 
other 
observable 
market 
information, 
which 
provides 
benchmark 
valuation 
multiples 
from 
guideline 
companies.
The 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
reporting 
unit 
is 
highly 
sensitive 
to 
changes 
in 
these 
estimates 
and 
assumptions; 
therefore, 
in 
some 
instances, 
changes 
in 
these 
assumptions 
could 
impact 
whether 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
is 
greater 
than 
its 
carrying 
value. 
The 
Company 
performs 
sensitivity 
analyses 
around 
these 
assumptions 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
assumptions, 
and 
the 
resulting 
estimated 
fair 
values. 
In 
the 
interim 
analysis 
of 
the 
Wholesale 
Banking 
reporting 
unit 
at 
December 
31, 
2014, 
we 
evaluated 
sensitivity 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
discount 
rate, 
which 
indicated 
that 
if 
the 
discount 
rate 
was 
increased 
50 
basis 
points, 
the 
reporting 
unit's 
fair 
value 
would 
equal 
its 
carrying 
value. 
Ultimately
, 
future 
potential 
changes 
in 
these 
assumptions 
may 
impact 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
and 
cause 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
reporting 
unit 
to 
be 
below 
its 
carrying 
value. 
Additionally
, 
a 
reporting 
unit's 
carrying 
value 
of 
equity 
could 
change 
based 
on 
market 
conditions, 
asset 
growth, 
or 
the 
risk 
profile 
of 
those 
reporting 
units, 
which 
could 
impact 
whether 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
is 
less 
than 
carrying 
value.
Income T

estimate 
income 
tax 
expense 
based 
on 
amounts 
expected 
to 
be 
owed 
to 
these 
various 
tax 
jurisdictions. 
The 
estimated 
income 
tax 
expense 
or 
benefit 
is 
reported 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income.
Accrued 
taxes 
represent 
the 
net 
estimated 
amount 
due 
to 
or 
to 
be 
received 
from 
tax 
jurisdictions 
either 
currently 
or 
in 
the 
future 
and 
are 
reported 
in 
other 
liabilities 
on 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets. 
In 
estimating 
accrued 
taxes, 
we 
assess 
the 
appropriate 
tax 
treatment 
of 
transactions 
and 
filing 
positions 
after 
considering 
statutes, 
regulations, 
judicial 
precedent, 
and 
other 
pertinent 
information. 
The 
income 
tax 
laws 
are 
complex 
and 
subject 
to 
dif
ferent 
interpretations 
by 
the 
taxpayer 
and 
the 
relevant 
government 
taxing 
authorities. 
Significant 
judgment 
is 
required 
in 
determining 
the 
tax 
accruals 
and 
in 
evaluating 
our 
tax 
positions, 
including 
evaluating 
uncertain 
tax 
positions. 
Changes 
in 
the 
estimate 
of 
accrued 
taxes 
occur 
periodically 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
tax 
rates, 
interpretations 
of 
tax 
laws, 
the 
status 
of 
examinations 
by 
the 
tax 
authorities, 
and 
newly 
enacted 
statutory
, 
judicial, 
and 
regulatory 
guidance 
that 
could 
impact 
the 
relative 
merits 
and 
risks 
of 
tax 
positions. 
These 
changes, 
when 
they 
occur
, 
impact 
tax 
expense 
and 
can 
materially 
af
fect 
our 
operating 
results. 
W

available.
Deferred 
income 
tax 
assets 
represent 
amounts 
available 
to 
reduce 
income 
taxes 
payable 
in 
future 
years. 
Such 
assets 
arise 
due 
to 
temporary 
dif
ferences 
between 
the 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
tax 
bases 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
NOL
 
and

W

the 
realizability 
of

As. 
A
 
valuation 
allowance 
is 
recognized 
for 
a 
DT
A
 
if, 
based 
on 
the 
weight 
of 
available 
evidence, 
it 
is 
more-likely-than-not 
that 
some 
portion 
or 
all 
of 
the 
DT
A
 
will 
not 
be 
realized. 
In 
determining 
whether 
a 
valuation 
allowance 
is 
necessary
, 
we 
consider 
the 
level 
of 
taxable 
income 
in 
prior 
years 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
carrybacks 
are 
permitted 
under 
current 
tax 
laws, 
as 
well 
as 
estimates 
of 
future 
pre-tax 
and 
taxable 
income 
and 
tax 
planning 
strategies 
that 
would, 
if 
necessary
, 
be 
implemented.

e 
currently 
maintain 
a 
valuation 
allowance 
for 
certain 
state 
carryforwards 
and 
certain 
other 
state 
DT

Since 
we 
expect 
to 
realize 
our 
remaining 
federal 
and

no 
valuation 
allowance 
is 
deemed 
necessary

The 
main 
variables 
are: 
(1)

(2) 
discount

Size 
and 
Characteristics 
of 
the 
Employee 
Population
Pension 
cost 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
the 
number 
of 
employees 
eligible 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
plan 
and 
other 
factors 
including 
historical 
compensation, 
age, 
years 
of 
employment, 
and 
benefit 
terms. 
A
 
curtailment 
of 
all 
future 
pension 
benefit 
accruals 
was 
ef
fective 
December 
31, 
201
1. 
Prior 
to 
the 
pension 
curtailment, 
most 
participants 
who 
had 
20 
or 
more 
years 
of 
service 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2007 
received 
benefits 
based 
on 
a 
traditional 
pension 
formula 
with 
benefits 
linked 
to 
their 
final 
average 
pay 
and 
years 
of 
service. 
Most 
other 
participants 
received 
a 
traditional 
pension 
for 
periods 
through 
December 
31, 
2007. 
Beginning 
in 
2008, 
a 
cash 
balance 
benefit 
based 
on 
annual 
compensation 
and 
interest 
credits 
was 
earned. 
Continued 
changes 
in 
the 
size 
and 
characteristics 
of 
the 
workforce 
could 
result 
in 
a 
partial 
settlement 
of 
the 
pension 
plan. 
If 
lump 
sum 
payments 
in 
a 
year 
exceed 
the 
total 
of 
interest 
cost 
and 
service 
cost, 
then 
settlement 
accounting 
requires 
immediate 
recognition 
through 
earnings 
of 
any 
net 
actuarial 
gain 
or 
loss 
recorded 
in 
AOCI 
based 
on 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
plan 
assets 
and 
plan 
obligations 
prior 
to 
settlement, 
and 
recognition 
of 
any 
settlement 
related 
costs. 
W
e 
estimate 
the 
financial 
impact 
of 
a 
partial 
settlement 
in 
2015 
would 
be 
recognition 
of 
approximately 
$40 
million 
in 
additional 
benefit 
cost; 
however
, 
additional 
lump 
sum 
payments 
could 
cause 
the 
amount 
of 
benefit 
cost 
recognized 
to 
be 
higher
.

Discount Rate
The 
discount 
rate 
is 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
present 
value 
of 
future 
benefit 
obligations. 
The 
discount 
rate 
for 
each 
plan 
is 
determined 
by 
matching 
the

cash 
flows 
of

The

annually

upon

that 
triggers

If 
we

0.25% 
increase/decrease 
in 
the 
discount 
rate 
for 
all 
retirement 
and 
other 
postretirement 
plans 
and

the 
benefit

Expected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan 
Assets
Expected 
returns 
on 
plan 
assets 
are 
computed 
using 
long-term 
rate 
of 
return 
assumptions 
which 
are 
selected 
after 
considering 
plan 
investments, 
historical 
returns, 
and 
potential 
future 
returns. 
Our 
2014 
pension 
costs 
reflect 
an 
assumed 
long-term 
rate 
of 
return 
on 
plan 
assets 
of 
7.20% 
for 
the 
SunT
rust 
Banks, 
Inc. 
Retirement 
Plan 
and 
6.65% 
for 
a 
previously 
acquired 
National 
Commerce 
Financial 
Corporation 
Retirement 
Plan.
Any 
dif
ferences 
between 
expected 
and 
actual 
returns 
are 
included 
in 
the 
unrecognized 
net 
actuarial 
gain 
or

amortize 
gains/losses 
in 
pension 
expense 
when 
the 
total 
unamortized 
amount 
exceeds 
10% 
of 
plan 
assets 
or 
the 
projected 
benefit 
obligations, 
whichever 
is 
greater
. 
All 
pension 
gains 
or 
losses 
are 
being 
amortized 
over 
participants' 
average 
expected 
future 
lifetime, 
which 
is 
approximately 
34 
years. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
assume 
a 
0.25% 
increase/decrease 
in 
the 
expected 
long-term 
rate 
of 
return 
for 
the 
retirement 
and 
other 
postretirement 
plans, 
holding 
all 
other 
actuarial 
assumptions 
constant, 
the 
benefit 
cost 
would 
decrease/increase 
by 
approximately 
$7 
million.

actuarial

required 
about 
factors 
such 
as 
mortality

retirement 
rate, 
and 
disability 
rate. 
These 
factors 
do 
not 
tend

significantly 
over

so 
the

ENTERPRISE 
RISK 
MANAGEMENT
In 
the 
normal 
course 
of 
business, 
we 
are 
exposed 
to 
various 
risks. 
W
e 
have 
established 
an 
enterprise 
risk 
governance 
framework 
to 
identify 
and 
manage 
these 
risks 
and 
support 
key 
business 
objectives. 
Underlying 
this 
framework 
are 
limits, 
policies, 
metrics, 
processes, 
and 
procedures 
designed 
to 
ef
fectively 
identify
, 
monitor
, 
and 
manage 
risk 
within 
the

our 
overall 
risk 
appetite

Credit 
Risk 
Management
Credit 
risk 
refers 
to 
the 
potential 
for 
economic 
loss 
arising 
from 
the 
failure 
of 
clients 
to 
meet 
their 
contractual 
agreements 
on 
all 
credit 
instruments, 
including 
on-balance 
sheet 
exposures 
from 
loans 
and 
leases, 
investment 
securities, 
and 
contingent 
exposures 
including 
unfunded 
commitments, 
letters 
of 
credit, 
credit 
derivatives, 
and 
counterparty 
risk 
under 
derivative 
products. 
As 
credit 
risk 
is 
an 
essential 
component 
of 
many 
of 
the 
products 
and 
59
services 
we 
provide 
to 
our 
clients, 
the 
ability 
to 
accurately 
measure 
and 
manage 
credit 
risk 
is 
integral 
to 
maintain 
the 
long-

profitability 
and 
capital 
adequacy 
of 
our 
business.

Market 
Risk 
Management
 
Market 
risk 
refers 
to 
potential 
losses 
arising 
from 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates, 
foreign 
exchange 
rates, 
equity 
prices, 
commodity 
prices, 
and 
other 
relevant 
market 
rates 
or 
prices. 
Interest 
rate 
risk, 
defined 
as 
the 
exposure 
of 
net 
interest 
income 
and 
MVE
 
to 
adverse 
movements 
in 
interest 
rates, 
is 
our 
primary 
market 
risk 
and 
mainly 
arises 
from 
the 
structure 
of 
our 
balance 
sheet. 
V
ariable 
rate 
loans, 
prior 
to 
any 
hedging 
related 
actions, 
are 
approximately 
62%
 
of 
total 
loans 
and 
after 
giving 
consideration 
to 
hedging 
related 
actions, 
are 
approximately 
46%
 
of 
total 
loans. 
Approximately 
4%
 
of 
our 
variable 
rate 
loans 
have 
coupon 
rates 
that 
are 
equal 
to 
a 
contractually 
specified 
interest 
rate 
floor
. 
In 
addition 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
we 
are 
also 
exposed 
to 
market 
risk 
in 
our 
trading 
instruments 
carried 
at 
fair 
value. 
Our 
ALCO
 
meets 
regularly 
and 
is 
responsible 
for

monitor 
and 
limit 
exposure 
to

risk.
Market 
Risk 
fr
om 
Non-T
rading 
Activities
The 
primary 
goal 
of 
interest 
rate 
risk 
management 
is 
to 
control 
exposure 
to 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
within 
policy 
limits 
approved 
by 
the 
Board
. 
These 
limits 
and 
guidelines 
reflect 
our 
tolerance 
for 
interest 
rate 
risk 
over 
both 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
horizons. 
No 
limit 
breaches 
occurred 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014
. 
The 
major 
sources 
of 
our 
non-trading 
interest 
rate 
risk 
are 
timing 
dif
ferences 
in 
the 
maturity 
and 
repricing 
characteristics 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities, 
changes 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
yield 
curve, 
and 
the 
potential 
exercise 
of 
explicit 
or 
embedded 
options. 
W
e 
measure 
these 
risks 
and 
their 
impact 
by 
identifying 
and 
quantifying 
exposures 
through 
the 
use 
of 
sophisticated 
simulation 
and 
valuation 
models, 
which, 
as 
described 
in 
additional 
detail 
below
, 
are 
employed 
by 
management 
to 
understand 
net 
interest 
income 
at 
risk 
and 
MVE
 
at 
risk. 
These 
measures 
show 
that 
our 
interest 
rate 
risk 
profile 
is 
moderately 
asset 
sensitive 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
MVE
 
and 
net 
interest 
income 
sensitivity 
are 
complementary 
interest 
rate 
risk 
metrics 
and 
should 
be 
viewed 
together
. 
Net 
interest 
income 
sensitivity 
captures 
asset 
and 
liability 
repricing 
mismatches 
for 
the 
first 
year
, 
inclusive 
of 
forecast 
balance 
sheet 
changes, 
and 
is 
considered 
a 
shorter 
term 
measure, 
while 
MVE
 
sensitivity 
captures 
mismatches 
within 
the 
period 
end 
balance 
sheets 
through 
the 
financial 
instruments' 
respective 
maturities 
and 
is 
considered 
a 
longer 
term 
measure. 
A
 
positive 
net 
interest 
income 
sensitivity 
in 
a 
rising 
rate 
environment 
indicates 
that 
over 
the 
forecast 
horizon 
of 
one 
year
, 
asset 
based 
income 
will 
increase 
more 
quickly 
than 
liability 
based 
expense 
due 
to 
balance 
sheet 
composition.€
A
 
negative 
MVE
 
sensitivity 
in 
a 
rising 
rate 
environment 
indicates 
that 
the 
value 
of 
financial 
assets 
will 
decrease 
more 
than 
the 
value 
of 
financial 
liabilities 
will 
increase. 
One 
of 
the 
primary 
methods 
that 
we 
use 
to 
quantify 
and 
manage 
interest 
rate 
risk 
is 
simulation 
analysis, 
which 
we 
use 
to 
model 
net 
interest 
income 
from 
assets, 
liabilities, 
and 
derivative 
positions 
under 
various 
interest 
rate 
scenarios 
and 
balance 
sheet 
structures. 
This 
analysis 
measures 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
net 
interest 
income 
over 
a 
two 
year 
time 
horizon, 
which 
dif
fers 
from 
the 
interest 
rate 
sensitivities 
in 
T
able 
25
, 
which 
are 
prescribed 
to 
be 
over 
a 
one 
year 
time 
horizon. 
Key 
assumptions 
in 
the 
simulation 
analysis 
(and 
in 
the 
valuation 
analysis 
discussed 
below) 
relate 
60
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
interest 
rates 
and 
spreads, 
the 
changes 
in 
product 
balances, 
and 
the 
behavior 
of 
loan 
and 
deposit 
clients 
in 
dif
ferent 
rate 
environments. 
This 
analysis 
incorporates 
several 
assumptions, 
the 
most 
material 
of 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
repricing 
characteristics 
and 
balance 
fluctuations 
of 
deposits 
with 
indeterminate 
or 
non-contractual 
maturities.
As 
the 
future 
path 
of 
interest 
rates 
cannot 
be 
known, 
we 
use 
simulation 
analysis 
to 
project 
net 
interest 
income 
under 
various 
scenarios 
including 
implied 
forward 
and 
deliberately 
extreme 
and 
perhaps 
unlikely 
scenarios. 
The 
analyses 
may 
include 
rapid 
and 
gradual 
ramping 
of 
interest 
rates, 
rate 
shocks, 
basis 
risk 
analysis, 
and 
yield 
curve 
twists. 
Specific 
strategies 
are 
also 
analyzed 
to 
determine 
their 
impact 
on 
net 
interest 
income 
levels 
and 
sensitivities.
The 
sensitivity 
analysis 
presented 
in 
T
able 
25
 
is 
measured 
as 
a 
percentage 
change 
in 
net 
interest 
income 
due 
to 
instantaneous 
moves 
in 
benchmark 
interest 
rates. 
Estimated 
changes 
set 
forth 
below 
are 
dependent 
upon 
material 
assumptions 
such 
as 
those 
previously 
discussed.

The 
increase 
in 
net 
interest 
income 
asset 
sensitivity 
compared 
to 
December€31, 
2013
 
is 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
balance 
sheet 
composition, 
particularly 
variable 
rate 
loan 
growth 
and 
increased 
client 
deposits, 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
accretive 
to 
net 
interest 
income 
in 
a 
rising 
rate 
environment. 
See 
additional 
discussion 
related 
to 
net 
interest 
income 
in 
the 
"Net 
Interest 
Income/Mar
gin" 
section 
of 
this 
MD&A
. 
W
e 
also 
perform 
valuation 
analysis, 
which 
we 
use 
for 
discerning 
levels 
of 
risk 
present 
in 
the 
balance 
sheet 
and 
derivative 
positions 
that 
might 
not 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
horizon. 
Whereas 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
highlights 
exposures 
over 
a 
relatively 
short 
time 
horizon, 
valuation 
analysis 
incorporates 
all 
cash 
flows 
over 
the 
estimated 
remaining 
life 
of 
all 
balance 
sheet 
and 
derivative 
positions. 
The 
valuation 
of 
the 
balance 
sheet, 
at 
a 
point 
in 
time, 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
discounted 
present 
value 
of 
asset 
cash 
flows 
and 
derivative 
cash 
flows 
minus 
the 
discounted 
present 
value 
of 
liability 
cash 
flows, 
the 
net 
of 
which 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
MVE
. 
The 
sensitivity 
of 
MVE
 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
level 
of 
interest 
rates 
is 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
longer
-term 
repricing 
risk 
and 
options 
risk 
embedded 
in 
the 
balance 
sheet. 
Similar 
to 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation, 
MVE
 
uses 
instantaneous 
changes 
in 
rates. 
However
, 
MVE
 
values 
only 
the 
current 
balance 
sheet 
and 
does 
not 
incorporate 
projections 
that 
are 
used 
in 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
model. 
As 
with 
the 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
model, 
assumptions 
about 
the 
timing 
and 
variability 
of 
balance 
sheet 
cash 
flows 
are 
critical 
in 
the 
MVE
 
analysis. 
Particularly 
important 
are 
the 
assumptions 
driving 
prepayments 
and 
the 
expected 
changes 
in 
balances 
and 
pricing 
of 
the 
indeterminate 
deposit 
portfolios. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
MVE
 
profile 
in 
T
able 
26
 
indicated 
a 
decline 
in 
net 
balance 
sheet 
value 
due 
to 
instantaneous 
upward 
changes 
in 
rates. 
MVE
 
sensitivity 
is 
reported 
in 
both 
upward 
and 
downward 
rate 
shocks.€

The 
decrease 
in 
MVE
 
sensitivity 
from 
December€31, 
2013
 
is 
primarily 
due 
to 
a 
significant 
flattening 
of 
yield 
curves, 
an 
aging 
of 
interest 
rate 
swaps, 
fixed 
rate 
debt 
issuances, 
faster 
assumed 
prepayments, 
and 
the 
annual 
assumption 
review 
of 
indeterminate 
maturity 
deposits. 
While 
an 
instantaneous 
and 
severe 
shift 
in 
interest 
rates 
was 
used 
in 
this 
analysis 
to 
provide 
an 
estimate 
of 
exposure 
under 
these 
rate 
scenarios, 
we 
believe 
that 
a 
gradual 
shift 
in 
interest 
rates 
would 
have 
a 
much 
more 
modest 
impact. 
Since 
MVE
 
measures 
the 
discounted 
present 
value 
of 
cash 
flows 
over 
the 
estimated 
lives 
of 
instruments, 
the 
change 
in 
MVE
 
does 
not 
directly 
correlate 
to 
the 
degree 
that 
earnings 
would 
be 
impacted 
over 
a 
shorter 
time 
horizon 
(i.e., 
the 
current 
year). 
Further
, 
MVE
 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
factors 
such 
as 
future 
balance 
sheet 
growth, 
changes 
in 
product 
mix, 
changes 
in 
yield 
curve 
relationships, 
and 
changing 
product 
spreads 
that 
could 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates. 
The 
net 
interest 
income 
simulation 
and 
valuation 
analyses 
do 
not 
include 
actions 
that 
management 
may 
undertake 
to 
manage 
this 
risk 
in 
response 
to 
anticipated 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates.
Market 
Risk 
fr
om 
T
rading 
Activities
 
Under 
established 
policies 
and 
procedures, 
we 
manage 
market 
risk 
associated 
with 
trading 
activities 
using 
a 
V
AR
 
approach 
that 
takes 
into 
account 
exposures 
resulting 
from 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
equity 
risk, 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
risk, 
credit 
spread 
risk, 
and 
commodity 
price 
risk. 
For 
trading 
portfolios, 
V
AR
 
measures 
the 
estimated 
maximum 
loss 
from 
a 
trading 
position, 
given 
a 
specified 
confidence 
level 
and 
time 
horizon. 
V
AR
 
results 
are 
monitored 
daily 
for 
each 
trading 
portfolio 
against 
established 
limits. 
For 
risk 
management 
purposes, 
our 
V
AR
 
calculation 
is 
based 
on 
a 
historical 
simulation 
and 
measures 
the 
potential 
trading 
losses 
using 
a 
one-day 
holding 
period 
at 
a 
one-tail, 
99% 
confidence 
level. 
This 
means 
that, 
on 
average, 
trading 
losses 
are 
expected 
to 
exceed 
V
AR
 
one 
out 
of 
100 
trading 
days 
or 
two 
to 
three 
times 
per 
year
. 
While 
V
AR
 
can 
be 
a 
useful 
risk 
management 
tool, 
it 
does 
have 
inherent 
limitations 
including 
the 
assumption 
that 
past 
market 
behavior 
is 
indicative 
of 
future 
market 
performance. 
As 
such, 
V
AR
 
is 
only 
one 
of 
several 
tools 
used 
to 
manage 
trading 
risk. 
Other 
tools 
used 
to 
actively 
manage 
trading 
risk 
include 
scenario 
analysis, 
stress 
testing, 
profit 
and 
loss 
attribution, 
and 
stop 
loss 
limits. 
In 
addition 
to 
V
AR
, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
2013 
Market

Rule, 
we 
also

Stressed

The 
trading 
portfolio, 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
V
AR
, 
is 
predominantly 
comprised 
of 
four 
material 
sub-portfolios 
of 
covered 
positions: 
Credit 
T
rading, 
Fixed 
Income 
Securities, 
Interest 
Rate 
Derivatives, 
and 
Equity 
Derivatives. 
While 
there 
were 
no 
material 
changes 
in 
composition 
of 
the 
trading 
portfolio 
during 
2014
, 
there 
was 
a 
reduction 
in 
average 
daily 
V
AR
 
during 
2014
 
compared 
to 
2013. 
This 
was 
driven 
primarily 
by 
lower 
levels 
of 
volatility 
as 
well 
as 
some 
risk 
reducing 
activities 
in 
the 
trading 
portfolio. 
Daily 
V
AR
 
decreased 
to 
$1 
million
 
at 
December€31, 
2014
 
compared 
to 
$3 
million
 
at 
December€31, 
2013
. 
The 
trading 
portfolio 
of 
covered 
positions 
did 
not 
contain 
any 
correlation 
trading 
positions 
or 
on- 
or 
of
f-balance 
sheet 
securitization 
positions 
during 
2014
.
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
Market 
Risk 
Rule, 
we 
evaluate 
the 
accuracy 
of 
our 
V
AR
 
model 
through 
daily 
backtesting 
by 
comparing 
daily 
trading 
gains 
and 
losses 
(excluding 
fees, 
commissions, 
reserves, 
net 
interest 
income, 
and 
intraday 
trading) 
with 
the 
corresponding 
daily 
V
AR
-based 
measures. 
As 
illustrated 
below 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December€31, 
2014
, 
there 
was 
one 
instance 
in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
where 
trading 
losses 
exceeded 
firmwide 
V
AR
 
which 
created 
a 
backtest 
exception. 
This 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
the 
widening 
of 
credit 
spreads 
in 
the 
corporate 
debt 
markets. 
The 
actual 
number 
of 
backtesting 
exceptions 
over 
the 
preceding 
12 
months 
is 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
multiplication 
factor 
for 
the 
V
AR-based 
capital 
requirement 
under 
the 
Market 
Risk 
Rule, 
whereby 
the 
capital 
multiplication 
factor 
increases 
from 
a 
minimum 
of 
three 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
four
, 
depending 
on 
the 
number 
of 
exceptions. 
This 
exception 
did 
not 
result 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
capital 
multiplication 
factor
.

Model 
risk 
management: 
Our 
model 
risk 
management 
approach 
for 
validating 
and 
evaluating 
the 
accuracy 
of 
internal 
and 
vended 
models 
and 
associated 
processes 
includes 
developmental 
and 
implementation 
testing 
and 
ongoing 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance 
performed 
by 
the 
various 
model 
developers 
in 
conjunction 
with 
model 
owners. 
Our 
MRMG
 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
independent 
model 
validation 
for 
the 
V
AR
 
and 
stressed 
V
AR
 
models. 
The 
validation 
typically 
includes 
evaluation 
of 
all 
model 
documentation, 
as 
well 
as 
model 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance 
plans. 
In 
addition, 
the 
MRMG
 
performs 
its 
own 
testing. 
Due 
to 
ongoing 
developments 
in 
financial 
markets, 
evolution 
in 
modeling 
approaches, 
and 
for 
purposes 
of 
model 
enhancement, 
we 
assess 
the 
performance 
of 
all 
V
AR
 
models 
regularly 
through 
the 
model 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance 
process. 
During 
2014
, 
as 
part 
of 
our 
ongoing 
model 
monitoring 
and 
maintenance, 
we 
enhanced 
the 
granularity 
of 
the 
credit 
curves 
used 
in 
our 
V
AR
 
and 
Stressed 
V
AR
 
models 
by 
adding 
more 
tenors 
and 
industry 
sectors.
Str
ess 
testing: 
 
W
e 
use 
a 
comprehensive 
range 
of 
stress 
testing 
techniques 
to 
help 
monitor 
risks 
across 
trading 
desks 
and 
to 
augment 
standard 
daily 
V
AR
 
reporting. 
The 
stress 
testing 
framework 
is 
designed 
to 
quantify 
the 
impact 
of 
rare 
and 
extreme 
historical 
but 
plausible 
stress 
scenarios 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
lar
ge 
unexpected 
losses. 
In 
addition 
to 
performing 
firmwide 
stress 
testing 
of 
our 
aggregate 
trading 
portfolio, 
additional 
types 
of 
secondary 
stress 
tests 
including 
historical 
repeats 
and 
simulations 
using 
hypothetical 
risk 
factor 
shocks 
are 
also 
performed. 
Across 
our 
comprehensive 
stress 
testing 
framework, 
all 
trading 
positions 
across 
each 
applicable 
market 
risk 
category 
(interest 
rate 
risk, 
equity 
risk, 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
risk, 
credit 
spread 
risk, 
and 
commodity 
price 
risk) 
are 
included. 
W
e 
review 
stress 
testing 
scenarios 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis 
and 
make 
updates 
as 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
that 
both 
current 
and 
potential 
emer
ging 
risks 
are 
appropriately 
captured.
T
rading 
portfolio 
capital 
adequacy: 
W
e 
assess 
capital 
adequacy 
on 
a 
regular 
basis, 
based 
on 
estimates 
of 
our 
risk 
profile 
and 
capital 
positions 
under 
baseline 
and 
stressed 
scenarios. 
Scenarios 
consider 
material 
risks, 
including 
credit 
risk, 
market 
risk, 
and 
operational 
risk. 
Our 
assessment 
of 
capital 
adequacy 
arising 
from 
market 
risk 
also 
includes 
a 
review 
of 
risk 
arising 
from 
material 
portfolios 
of 
covered 
positions.

Liquidity 
Risk 
Management
Liquidity 
risk 
is 
the 
risk 
of 
being 
unable, 
at 
a 
reasonable 
cost, 
to 
meet 
financial 
obligations 
as 
they 
come 
due. 
W
e 
manage 
liquidity 
risk 
utilizing 
three 
lines 
of 
defense 
as 
described 
below
. 
These 
lines 
of 
defense 
are 
designed 
to 
mitigate 
our 
three 
primary 
liquidity 
risks: 
structural 
(ﬁmismatchﬂ) 
liquidity 
risk, 
market 
liquidity 
risk, 
and 
contingent 
liquidity 
risk. 
Structural 
liquidity 
risk 
arises 
from 
our 
maturity 
transformation 
activities 
and 
63
balance 
sheet 
structure, 
which 
may 
create 
mismatches 
in 
the 
timing 
of 
cash 
inflows 
and 
outflows. 
Market 
liquidity 
risk, 
which 
we 
also 
describe 
as 
refinancing 
or 
refunding 
risk, 
constitutes 
the 
risk 
that 
we 
could 
lose 
access 
to 
the 
financial 
markets 
or 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
access 
may 
rise 
to 
undesirable 
levels. 
Contingent 
liquidity 
risk 
arises 
from 
rare 
and 
severely 
adverse 
liquidity 
events; 
these 
events 
may 
be 
idiosyncratic 
or 
systemic.
W
e 
mitigate 
these 
risks 
utilizing 
a 
variety 
of 
tested 
liquidity 
management 
techniques 
in 
keeping 
with 
regulatory 
guidance 
and 
industry 
best 
practices. 
For 
example, 
we 
mitigate 
structural 
liquidity 
risk 
by 
structuring 
our 
balance 
sheet 
prudently 
so 
that 
we 
fund 
less 
liquid 
assets, 
such 
as 
loans, 
with 
stable 
funding 
sources, 
such 
as 
retail 
and 
wholesale 
deposits, 
long-term 
debt, 
and 
capital. 
W
e 
mitigate 
market 
liquidity 
risk 
by 
maintaining 
diverse 
borrowing 
resources 
to 
fund 
projected 
cash 
needs 
and 
structuring 
our 
liabilities 
to 
avoid 
maturity 
concentrations. 
W
e 
model 
contingent 
liquidity 
risk 
from 
a 
range 
of 
potential 
adverse 
circumstances 
in 
our 
contingency 
funding 
scenarios. 
These 
scenarios 
inform 
the 
amount 
of 
contingency 
liquidity 
sources 
we 
maintain 
as 
a 
buf
fer 
to 
ensure 
we 
can 
meet 
our 
obligations 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
under 
adverse 
events. 
Governance. 
W
e 
maintain 
a 
comprehensive 
liquidity 
risk 
governance 
structure 
in 
keeping 
with 
regulatory 
guidance 
and 
industry 
best 
practices. 
Our 
Board
, 
through 
the 
BRC
, 
oversees 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
and 
establishes 
our 
liquidity 
risk 
appetite 
via 
a 
set 
of 
cascading 
risk 
limits. 
The 
BRC
 
reviews 
and 
approves 
risk 
policies 
to 
establish 
these 
limits 
and 
regularly 
reviews 
reports 
prepared 
by 
senior 
management 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
these 
policies. 
The 
Board
 
char
ges 
the 
CEO
 
with 
determining 
corporate 
strategies 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
risk 
appetite 
and 
the 
CEO
 
is 
a 
member 
of 
our 
ALCO
, 
which 
is 
the 
executive 
level 
committee 
with 
oversight 
of 
liquidity 
risk 
management. 
The 
ALCO
 
regularly 
monitors 
our 
liquidity 
and 
compliance 
with 
liquidity 
risk 
limits, 
and 
also 
reviews 
and 
approves 
liquidity 
management 
strategies 
and 
tactics.
Management 
and 
Reporting 
Framework
. 
W
e 
base 
our 
governance 
structure 
on 
and 
mitigate 
liquidity 
risk 
using 
three 
lines 
of 
defense. 
Our 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
department 
constitutes 
the 
first 
line 
of 
defense, 
managing 
consolidated 
liquidity 
risks 
we 
incur 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
business. 
Under 
the 
oversight 
of 
the 
ALCO
, 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
thereby 
assumes 
responsibility 
for 
identifying, 
measuring, 
monitoring, 
reporting, 
and 
managing 
our 
liquidity 
risks. 
In 
so 
doing, 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
develops 
and 
implements 
short- 
and 
long-term 
liquidity 
management 
strategies, 
funding 
plans, 
and 
liquidity 
stress 
tests. 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
primarily 
monitors 
and 
manages 
liquidity 
risk 
at 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
and 
Bank
 
levels 
as 
the 
non-bank 
subsidiaries 
are 
relatively 
small 
and 
these 
subsidiaries 
ultimately 
rely 
upon 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
as 
a 
source 
of 
liquidity 
in 
adverse 
environments. 
However
, 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
also 
monitors 
liquidity 
developments 
in 
and 
maintains 
a 
regular 
dialogue 
with 
other 
legal 
entities 
within 
SunT
rust.
Our 
MRM
 
group 
constitutes 
our 
second 
line 
of 
defense 
in 
liquidity 
risk 
management. 
MRM
 
conducts 
independent 
oversight 
and 
governance 
of 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
activities. 
For 
example, 
MRM
 
works 
with 
Corporate 
T
reasury 
to 
ensure 
our 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
practices 
conform 
to 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations 
and 
evaluates 
key 
assumptions 
incorporated 
in 
our 
contingency 
funding 
scenarios.
Our 
internal 
audit 
function 
provides 
a 
third 
line 
of 
defense 
in 
liquidity 
risk 
management. 
The 
role 
of 
internal 
audit 
is 
to 
provide 
assurance 
through 
an 
independent 
assessment 
of 
the 
adequacy 
of 
internal 
controls 
in 
the 
first 
two 
lines 
of 
defense. 
These 
controls 
consist 
of 
procedural 
documentation, 
approval 
processes, 
reconciliations, 
and 
other 
mechanisms 
employed 
by 
the 
first 
two 
lines 
of 
defense 
in 
ensuring 
that 
liquidity 
risk 
is 
consistent 
with 
applicable 
policies, 
procedures, 
laws, 
and 
regulations.
In 
September 
2014, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
 
published 
final 
rules 
with 
respect 
to 
LCR
 
requirements. 
The 
LCR
 
will 
require 
banking 
or
ganizations 
to 
hold 
unencumbered 
high 
quality
, 
liquid 
assets 
suf
ficient 
to 
withstand 
projected 
cash 
outflows 
under 
a 
prescribed 
liquidity 
stress 
scenario. 
These 
new 
liquidity 
rules 
will 
be 
phased 
in 
as 
regulatory 
requirements 
and 
will 
require 
that 
we 
maintain 
an 
LCR
 
above 
90% 
beginning 
January 
1, 
2016 
and 
100% 
beginning 
January 
1, 
2017. 
W
e 
expect 
to 
meet 
or 
exceed 
LCR
 
requirements 
within 
the 
regulatory 
timelines. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
our 
LCR
 
was 
already 
above 
the 
January 
1, 
2016 
requirement 
of 
90%.
In 
201
1, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve
 
published 
proposed 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
regulation 
and 
supervision 
of 
lar
ge 
bank 
holding 
companies 
and 
systemically 
important 
nonbank 
financial 
firms, 
pursuant 
to 
Sections 
165 
and 
166 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act
. 
In 
February 
2014, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
approved 
final 
rules 
to 
implement 
these 
ﬁenhanced 
prudential 
standardsﬂ 
under 
Regulation 
YY
, 
which 
has 
an 
ef
fective 
date 
of 
January 
1, 
2015. 
These 
regulations 
include 
lar
gely 
qualitative 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
practices, 
including 
internal 
liquidity 
stress 
testing. 
W
e 
believe 
that 
our 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
and 
stress 
testing 
practices 
meet 
or 
exceed 
these 
new 
standards.
Uses 
of 
Funds. 
Our 
primary 
uses 
of 
funds 
include 
the 
extension 
of 
loans 
and 
credit, 
the 
purchase 
of 
investment 
securities, 
working 
capital, 
and 
debt 
and 
capital 
service. 
The 
Bank
 
and 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
borrow 
in 
the 
money 
markets 
using 
instruments 
such 
as 
Fed 
funds
, 
Eurodollars, 
and 
CP
. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
had 
no
 
CP
 
outstanding 
and 
the 
Bank
 
retained 
a 
material 
cash 
position 
in 
its 
Federal 
Reserve
 
account. 
The 
Parent 
Company
 
also 
retains 
a 
material 
cash 
position, 
in 
accordance 
with 
our 
policies 
and 
risk 
limits, 
discussed 
in 
greater 
detail 
below
.
Sour
ces 
of 
Funds.
 
Our 
primary 
source 
of 
funds 
is 
a 
lar
ge, 
stable 
retail 
deposit 
base. 
Core 
deposits, 
predominantly 
made 
up 
of 
consumer 
and 
commercial 
deposits 
originated 
primarily 
from 
our 
retail 
branch 
network, 
are 
our 
lar
gest 
and 
most 
cost-ef
fective 
source 
of 
funding. 
Core 
deposits 
increased 
to 
$139.2 
billion
 
at 
December€31, 
2014
, 
from 
$127.7 
billion
 
at 
December€31, 
2013
. 
W
e 
also 
maintain 
access 
to 
diversified 
sources 
for 
both 
secured 
and 
unsecured 
wholesale 
funding. 
These 
uncommitted 
sources 
include 
Fed 
funds

As 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
Bank
 
and 
Parent 
Company
 
maintain 
programs 
to 
access 
the 
debt 
capital 
markets. 
The 
Parent 
Company
 
maintains 
a 
SEC
 
shelf 
registration 
from 
which 
it 
may 
issue 
senior 
or 
subordinated 
notes 
and 
various 
capital 
securities 
such 
as 
common 
or 
preferred 
stock. 
Our 
Board
 
has 
authorized 
the 
issuance 
of 
up 
to 
$5.0 
billion
 
of 
such 
securities, 
of 
which 
approximately 
$2.4 
billion
 
of 
issuance 
capacity 
remained 
available 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
Bank
 
maintains 
a 
Global 
Bank 
Note 
program 
under 
which 
it 
may 
issue 
senior 
or 
subordinated 
debt 
with 
various 
terms. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
Bank
 
retained 
$35.4 
billion
 
of 
remaining 
capacity 
to 
issue 
notes 
under 
the 
Global 
Bank 
Note 
program.
Our 
issuance 
capacity 
under 
these 
Bank
 
and 
Parent 
Company
 
programs 
refers 
to 
authorization 
granted 
by 
our 
Board
, 
which 
is 
formal 
program 
capacity 
and 
not 
a 
commitment 
to 
purchase 
by 
any 
investor
. 
Debt 
and 
equity 
securities 
issued 
under 
these 
programs 
are 
designed 
to 
appeal 
primarily 
to 
domestic 
and 
international 
institutional 
investors. 
Institutional 
investor 
demand 
for 
these 
securities 
depends 
upon 
numerous 
factors, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
our 
credit 
ratings 
and 
investor 
perception 
of 
financial 
market 
conditions 
and 
the 
health 
of 
the 
banking 
sector
. 
Therefore, 
our 
ability 
to 
access 
these 
markets 
in 
the 
future 
could 
be 
impaired 
for 
either 
systemic 
or 
idiosyncratic 
reasons.

Although 
the 
Company
's 
investment

is 
a 
use 
of 
funds, 
we 
manage 
that 
investment 
portfolio 
primarily 
as 
a

of 
liquidity
, 
maintaining 
substantially 
all 
(approximately 
96%

classes 
such 
as

nearly

high-grade

qualify 
as 
high-quality

under

At 
December€31, 
2014

the

investment 
portfolio 
contained 
$22.2 
billion
 
of 
unencumbered 
high-quality
, 
liquid 
securities 
at 
book 
value. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
we 
maintain 
contingency

to 
anticipate 
and 
manage 
the 
likely 
impact 
of 
impaired 
capital

and 
other

Our

also 
provide 
for 
continuous

of 
net

Liquidity
. 
Our 
primary 
measure 
of 
Parent 
Company
 
liquidity 
is 
the 
length 
of 
time 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
can 
meet 
its 
existing 
and 
certain 
forecasted 
obligations 
using 
its 
cash 
resources. 
W
e 
measure 
and 
manage 
this 
metric, 
"Months 
to 
Required 
Funding," 
using 
forecasts 
of 
both 
normal 
and 
adverse 
conditions. 
Under 
adverse 
conditions, 
we 
measure 
how 
long 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
can 
meet 
its 
capital 
and 
debt 
service 
obligations 
after 
experiencing 
material 
attrition 
of 
short-term, 
unsecured 
funding 
and 
without 
the 
support 
of 
dividends 
from 
the 
Bank
 
or 
access 
to 
the 
capital 
markets. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
Parent's 
Months 
to 
Required 
Funding 
remained 
well 
in 
excess 
of 
current 
ALCO
 
and 
Board
 
limits. 
The 
BRC
 
regularly 
reviews 
this 
and 
other 
liquidity 
risk 
metrics. 
In 
accordance 
with 
these 
risk 
limits 
established 
by 
ALCO
 
and 
the 
Board
, 
we 
manage 
the 
Parent 
Company
™
s 
liquidity 
by 
structuring 
its 
net 
maturity 
schedule 
to 
minimize 
the 
amount 
of 
debt 
maturing 
within 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time. 
No 
Parent 
Company
 
debt 
matured 
during 
2014 
and 
no 
material 
Parent 
Company
 
debt 
is 
scheduled 
to 
mature 
in 
2015. 
A
 
majority 
of 
the 
Parent 
Company
™
s 
liabilities 
are 
long-term 
in 
nature, 
coming 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
issuances 
of 
our 
capital 
securities 
and 
long-term 
senior 
and 
subordinated 
notes. 
W
e 
manage 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
to 
maintain 
most 
of 
its 
liquid 
assets 
in 
cash 
and 
securities 
that 
it 
could 
quickly 
convert 
to 
cash. 
Unlike 
the 
Bank
, 
it 
is 
not 
typical 
for 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
to 
maintain 
a 
material 
investment 
portfolio 
of 
publicly 
traded 
securities. 
W
e 
manage 
the 
Parent 
Company
 
cash

all 
forecasted 
obligations 
(primarily 
debt 
and 
capital 
service) 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
months 
in 
accordance 
with 
our 
risk 
limits.
The 
primary 
uses 
of 
Parent 
Company
 
liquidity 
include 
debt 
service, 
dividends 
on 
capital 
instruments, 
the 
periodic

Other 
Liquidity 
Considerations.
 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
our 
liability 
for 
UTBs 
was 
$210 
million
 
and 
the 
liability 
for 
interest 
related 
to 
these 
UTBs 
was 
$20 
million
. 
The 
UTBs 
represent 
the 
dif
ference 
between 
tax 
positions 
taken 
or 
expected 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
our 
tax 
returns 
and 
the 
benefits 
recognized 
and 
measured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
relevant 
accounting 
guidance 
for 
income 
taxes. 
The 
UTBs 
are 
based 
on 
various 
tax 
positions 
in 
several 
jurisdictions, 
and 
if 
taxes 
related 
to 
these 
positions 
are 
ultimately 
paid, 
the 
payments 
would 
be 
made 
from 
our 
normal

over 
multiple

Other 
sources 
of

include 
the 
risk 
associated 
with 
holding 
residential 
and 
commercial 
mortgage 
loans, 
and 
other 
loans 
designated 
for 
sale, 
prior 
to 
selling 
them 
into 
the 
secondary 
market, 
commitments 
to 
clients 
to 
make 
mortgage

that 
will 
be 
sold 
to 
the 
secondary

and 
our 
investment 
in 
MSR

W

manage 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
residential 
mortgage 
LHFS
 
(i.e., 
the 
warehouse) 
and 
our 
IRLC
s 
on 
residential 
loans 
intended 
for 
sale. 
The 
warehouses 
and 
IRLCs 
consist 
primarily 
of 
fixed 
and 
adjustable 
rate 
single 
family 
residential 
loans. 
The 
risk 
associated 
with 
the 
warehouses 
and 
IRLCs 
is 
the 
potential 
change 
in 
interest 
rates 
between 
the 
time 
the 
customer 
locks 
the 
rate 
on 
the 
anticipated 
loan 
and 
the 
time 
the 
loan 
is 
sold 
on 
the 
secondary 
market, 
which 
is 
typically 
60-150 
days.
W
e 
manage 
interest 
rate 
risk 
predominantly 
with 
interest 
rate 
swaps, 
futures, 
and 
forward 
sale 
agreements, 
where 
the 
changes

the 
instruments 
substantially 
of

the 
changes 
in 
value 
of 
the 
warehouse 
and 
the 
IRLC
s. 
The 
IRLCs 
on 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
intended 
for 
sale 
are 
classified 
as 
derivative 
financial 
instruments 
and 
are 
not 
designated 
as 
hedge 
accounting 
relationships.
MSRs 
are 
the 
present 
value 
of 
future 
net 
cash 
flows 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
received 
from 
the 
mortgage 
servicing 
portfolio. 
The 
value 
of 
MSR
s 
is 
highly 
dependent 
upon 
the 
assumed 
prepayment 
speed 
of 
the 
mortgage 
servicing 
portfolio, 
which 
is 
driven 
by 
the 
level 
of 
certain 
key 
interest 
rates, 
primarily 
the 
30-
year 
current 
coupon 
par 
mortgage 
rate. 
Future 
expected 
net 
cash 
flows 
from 
servicing 
a 
loan 
in 
the 
mortgage 
servicing 
portfolio 
would 
not 
be 
realized 
if 
the 
loan

The

The

an 
increase 
of 
$86 
million 
or 
6%, 
compared 
to 
2013. 
The 
increase 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase

reduction 
to

in 
the 
first

of

Other

increased 
due 
to

These

a 
decrease 
of 
$100 
million, 
or 
20%, 
compared 
to 
2012. 
The 
decrease 
was 
predominantly 
driven 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
mortgage 
production 
related 
income 
and 
lower 
mortgage 
servicing 
income, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
the

Mortgage 
production 
related 
income 
decreased 
$27

due 
to

Mortgage 
servicing 
income 
was 
$87 
million, 
a 
decrease 
of 
$173 
million, 
or 
67%, 
driven 
by 
less 
favorable 
net 
MSR
 
hedge

, 
and 
lower

due 
to

an

or 
10%, 
compared 
to 
2012. 
Operating

$234 
million 
due 
to 
$291

in 
char

to

certain 
mortgage-related 
legal

and 
a 
$96

compared 
to

These 
expenses 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
declines 
in

a 
decrease 
of 
$1.0 
billion, 
or 
66%, 
compared 
to 
2012. 
The 
decrease 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
securities 
gains 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
sale 
of 
our 
investment 
in 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock 
during 
2012 
and 
lower 
net 
interest 
income 
as 
a 
result 
of 
maturing 
commercial 
loan 
related-swap 
income, 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
lower 
provision 
for

during 
2013, 
a 
decrease 
of 
$84 
million, 
or 
21%, 
compared 
to 
2012. 
The 
decrease 
was 
driven 
by 
lower 
income 
from 
interest 
rate 
swaps 
and 
a 
$31 
million 
decrease 
in 
foregone 
dividend 
income 
resulting 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock 
in 
2012. 
These 
declines 
were 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
funding 
costs. 
T
otal 
average 
assets 
decreased 
$1.8 
billion, 
or 
6%, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
securities 
AFS
 
portfolio 
due 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
sale 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock. 
A
verage 
long-term 
debt 
decreased 
$1.9 
billion, 
or 
17%, 
and 
average 
short-
term 
borrowings 
decreased 
$1.5 
billion, 
or 
27%, 
compared 
to 
2012. 
The 
decline 
in 
average 
long-term 
debt 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
repayment 
of 
senior 
and 
subordinated 
debt, 
while 
the 
decline 
in 
average 
short-term 
debt 
was 
the 
result 
of 
the 
repayment 
of 
FHLB
 
borrowings.
T
otal 
noninterest

was 
$241 
million 
during 
2013, 
a 
decrease 
of 
$1.9 
billion, 
or 
89%, 
compared 
to 
2012, 
predominantly 
due 
to 
a 
$1.9 
billion 
net 
gain 
on 
sale 
of 
our 
investment 
in 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock 
in 
2012. 
This 
decrease 
was 
partially 
of
fset 
by 
a 
$63 
million 
decline 
in 
mark-

valuation 
losses 
on 
our 
public

and 
index-linked

during 
2013, 
a 
decrease 
of 
$125 
million, 
or 
59% 
compared 
to 
2012. 
The 
decrease 
in 
expense 
was 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
higher 
recovery 
of 
internal 
cost 
allocations 
and 
declines 
in 
severance 
costs, 
incentive 
compensation 
and 
employee 
benefits 
related 
to 
business 
performance, 
and 
operating 
losses 
compared 
to 
2012. 
Additionally
, 
2012 
expenses 
also 
included 
a 
$38 
million 
charitable 
contribution 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
stock 
to 
the 
SunT

Foundation 
and 
debt 
extinguishment 
char

related 
to 
the 
redemption 
of

The 
benefit 
for 
income 
taxes 
was 
$63 
million 
during 
2013 
compared 
to 
a 
provision 
for 
income 
taxes 
of 
$781 
million 
during 
2012. 
The 
provision 
for 
income 
taxes 
for 
the 
year 
2012 
included 
the 
income 
tax 
impact 
of 
the 
gains 
on 
the 
sale 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola

stock, 
while

to

an 
opinion 
on 
the 
company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
based 
on 
our

W
e 
conducted 
our 
audit 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
of 
the 
Public 
Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
Board 
(United

Those 
standards 
require 
that 
we 
plan 
and 
perform 
the 
audit 
to 
obtain 
reasonable 
assurance 
about 
whether 
ef
fective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
was 
maintained 
in 
all 
material 
respects. 
Our 
audit 
included 
obtaining 
an 
understanding 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
assessing 
the 
risk 
that 
a 
material 
weakness 
exists, 
testing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
ef
fectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
based 
on 
the 
assessed 
risk, 
and 
performing 
such 
other 
procedures 
as 
we 
considered 
necessary 
in 
the 
circumstances. 
W
e 
believe 
that 
our 
audit 
provides 
a 
reasonable 
basis 
for 
our 
opinion.
A
 
company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
for 
external 
purposes 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles. 
A
 
company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that 
(1) 
pertain 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
records 
that, 
in 
reasonable 
detail, 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect 
the 
transactions 
and 
dispositions 
of 
the 
assets 
of 
the 
company; 
(2) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
that 
transactions 
are 
recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles, 
and 
that 
receipts 
and 
expenditures 
of 
the 
company 
are 
being 
made 
only 
in 
accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
company; 
and 
(3) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
prevention 
or 
timely 
detection 
of 
unauthorized 
acquisition, 
use, 
or 
disposition 
of 
the 
company™
s 
assets 
that 
could 
have 
a 
material 
ef
fect 
on 
the 
financial 
statements.
Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
misstatements. 
Also, 
projections 
of 
any 
evaluation 
of 
ef
fectiveness 
to 
future 
periods 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
risk 
that 
controls 
may 
become 
inadequate 
because 
of 
changes 
in 
conditions, 
or 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
policies 
or 
procedures 
may 
deteriorate.
In 
our 
opinion, 
SunT
rust 
Banks, 
Inc. 
maintained, 
in 
all 
material 
respects, 
ef
fective 
internal

Principles 
of 
Consolidation 
and 
Basis 
of 
Presentation
The 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
include 
the 
accounts 
of 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
after 
elimination 
of 
significant 
intercompany 
accounts 
and 
transactions.
The 
Company 
holds 
VI
s, 
which 
are 
contractual 
ownership 
or 
other 
interests 
that 
change 
with 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
VIE
's 
net 
assets. 
The 
Company 
consolidates 
a 
VIE
 
if 
it 
is 
the 
primary 
beneficiary
, 
which 
is 
the 
party 
that 
has 
both 
the 
power 
to 
direct 
the 
activities 
that 
most 
significantly 
impact 
the 
financial 
performance 
of 
the 
VIE
 
and 
the 
obligation 
to 
absorb 
losses 
or 
rights 
to 
receive 
benefits 
through 
its 
VI
s 
that 
could 
potentially 
be 
significant 
to 
the 
VIE
. 
T
o 
determine 
whether 
or 
not 
a 
VI
 
held 
by 
the 
Company 
could 
potentially 
be 
significant 
to 
the 
VIE, 
both 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative 
factors 
regarding 
the 
nature, 
size, 
and 
form 
of 
the 
Company's 
involvement 
with 
the 
VIE 
are 
considered. 
The 
assessment 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
Company 
is 
the 
primary 
beneficiary 
of 
a 
VIE
 
is 
performed 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis. 
The 
Company 
consolidates 
VOE
s, 
which 
are 
entities 
that 
are 
not 
VIE
s 
and 
are 
controlled 
through 
the 
Company's 
equity 
interests 
or 
by 
other 
means.
Investments 
in 
companies 
which 
are 
not 
VIE
s, 
or 
where 
the 
Company 
is 
not 
the 
primary 
beneficiary 
of 
a 
VIE
, 
that 
the 
Company 
has 
the 
ability 
to 
exercise 
significant 
influence 
over 
operating 
and 
financing 
decisions, 
are 
accounted 
for 
using 
the 
equity 
method 
of 
accounting. 
These 
investments 
are 
included 
in 
other 
assets 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets 
at 
cost, 
adjusted 
to 
reflect 
the 
Company's 
portion 
of 
income, 
loss, 
or 
dividends 
of 
the 
investee. 
Equity 
investments 
that 
do 
not 
meet 
the 
criteria 
to 
be 
accounted 
for 
under 
the 
equity 
method 
and 
that 
do 
not 
result 
in 
consolidation 
of 
the 
investee 
are 
accounted 
for 
under 
the 
cost 
method. 
Cost 
method 
investments 
are 
included 
in 
other 
assets 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets 
and 
dividends 
received 
or 
receivable 
from 
these 
investments 
are 
included 
as 
a 
component 
of 
other 
noninterest 
income 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income.
Results 
of 
operations 
of 
acquired 
entities 
are 
included 
from 
the 
date 
of 
acquisition. 
Results 
of 
operations 
associated 
with

or

sold 
are 
included 
through 
the 
date 
of 
disposition.

If

before 
it 
is 
determined 
to 
be 
a 
TDR 
then 
the

performance 
by 
the

. 
Generally
, 
once 
a 
loan 
becomes 
a 
TDR, 
the 
Company 
expects 
that 
the

will 
continue 
to

reported 
as 
a 
TDR 
for 
its

with 
no 
concession 
to 
the

the 
borrower 
is 
no 
longer 
in

Interest

recognition 
on 
impaired 
loans 
is 
dependent 
upon

designation, 
and 
loan 
type 
as 
discussed 
above.
For

funded 
loans 
are 
recognized 
over 
the 
term 
of 
the

as 
an 
adjustment 
of 
the

If 
a

the

is 
recognized 
into

at 
the

is 
the

considered 
adequate 
to 
absorb 
probable

In 
addition 
to 
the 
review 
of 
credit 
quality 
through 
ongoing 
credit 
review 
processes, 
the 
Company 
employs 
a 
variety 
of 
modeling 
and 
estimation 
techniques 
to 
measure 
credit 
risk 
and 
construct 
an 
appropriate 
and 
adequate 
ALLL. 
Numerous 
asset 
quality 
measures, 
both 
quantitative 
and 
qualitative, 
are 
considered 
in 
estimating 
the 
ALLL. 
Such 
evaluation 
considers 
numerous 
factors 
for

portfolio 
segments, 
including,

A

when 
it

probable 
that 
the 
Company 
will 
be

If

, 
a 
specific 
allowance 
is 
established 
for 
individually 
evaluated 
impaired 
loans. 
The 
specific 
allowance 
established 
for 
these 
loans 
is 
based 
on 
a 
thorough 
analysis 
of 
the

the 
loan™
s 
estimated 
market 
value, 
or 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
underlying 
collateral. 
Any 
change 
in 
the 
present 
value 
attributable 
to 
the 
passage 
of

is 
recognized 
through 
the

General

are 
typically 
recognized

The 
Company 
uses 
numerous 
sources 
of 
information 
when 
evaluating 
a 
property™
s 
value. 
Estimated 
collateral 
valuations 
are 
based 
on 
appraisals, 
broker 
price 
opinions, 
recent 
sales 
of 
foreclosed 
properties, 
automated 
valuation 
models, 
other 
property-specific 
information, 
and 
relevant 
market 
information, 
supplemented 
by 
the 
Company™
s 
internal 
property 
valuation 
analysis. 
The 
value 
estimate 
is 
based 
on 
an 
orderly 
disposition 
inclusive 
of 
marketing 
costs. 
In 
limited 
instances, 
the 
Company 
adjusts 
externally 
provided 
appraisals 
for 
justifiable 
and 
well-
supported 
reasons, 
such 
as 
an 
appraiser 
not 
being 
aware 
of 
certain 
property-specific 
factors 
or 
recent 
sales 
information. 
Appraisals 
generally 
represent 
the 
ﬁas 
isﬂ 
value 
of 
the 
property 
but 
may 
be 
adjusted 
based 
on 
the 
intended 
disposition 
strategy 
of 
the 
property
.
For 
commercial 
and 
CRE 
loans 
secured 
by 
property
, 
an 
acceptable 
third 
party 
appraisal 
or 
other 
form 
of 
evaluation, 
as 
permitted 
by 
regulation, 
is 
obtained 
prior 
to 
the 
origination 
of 
the 
loan 
and 
upon 
a 
subsequent 
transaction 
involving 
a 
material 
change 
in 
terms. 
In 
addition, 
updated 
valuations 
may 
be 
obtained 
during 
the 
life 
of 
a 
transaction, 
as 
appropriate, 
such 
as 
when 
a 
loan's 
performance 
materially 
deteriorates. 
In 
situations 
where 
an 
updated 
appraisal 
has 
not 
been 
received 
or 
a 
formal 
evaluation 
performed, 
the 
Company 
monitors 
factors 
that 
can 
positively 
or 
negatively 
impact 
property 
value, 
such 
as 
the 
date 
of 
the 
last 
valuation, 
the 
volatility 
of 
property 
values 
in 
specific 
markets, 
changes 
in 
the 
value 
of 
similar 
properties, 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
characteristics 
of 
individual 
properties. 
Changes 
in

are 
recognized 
when 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
loss 
is 
quantifiable 
and 
timing 
is 
known. 
The 
char
ge-of

is 
measured 
based 
on 
the 
dif
ference 
between 
the 
loan™
s 
carrying 
value, 
including 
deferred 
fees, 
and 
the 
estimated 
realizable 
value 
of 
the 
loan, 
net 
of 
estimated 
selling 
costs. 
When 
valuing 
a 
property 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
determining 
a 
char
ge-of
f, 
a 
third 
party 
appraisal 
or 
an 
independently 
derived 
internal 
evaluation 
is 
generally 
employed.
For 
mortgage 
loans 
secured 
by 
residential 
property 
where 
the 
Company 
is 
proceeding 
with 
a 
foreclosure 
action, 
a 
new 
valuation 
is 
obtained 
prior 
to 
the 
loan 
becoming 
180 
days 
past 
due 
and, 
if 
required, 
the 
loan 
is 
written 
down 
to 
its 
realizable 
value, 
net 
of 
estimated 
selling 
costs. 
In 
the 
event 
the 
Company 
decides 
not 
to 
proceed 
with 
a 
foreclosure 
action, 
the 
full 
balance 
of 
the

is

If 
a 
loan 
remains 
in 
the 
foreclosure 
process 
for 
12 
months 
past 
the 
original 
char
ge-of

the 
Company 
obtains 
a 
new 
valuation 
annually
. 
Any 
additional 
loss 
based 
on 
the 
new 
valuation 
is 
char
ged-of

At 
foreclosure, 
a 
new 
valuation 
is 
obtained 
and 
the 
loan 
is 
transferred 
to 
OREO 
at 
the 
new 
valuation 
less 
estimated 
selling 
costs; 
any 
loan 
balance 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
transfer 
value 
is 
char
ged-of

Estimated 
declines 
in

of 
the 
residential 
collateral 
between 
these 
formal

events 
are 
captured 
in

on

in 
the

In 
addition 
to 
the

first 
step, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
each 
reporting 
unit 
is 
compared 
with 
its 
carrying 
value. 
If 
the 
fair 
value 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
carrying 
value, 
then 
the 
reporting 
unit's 
goodwill 
is 
considered 
not 
to 
be 
impaired. 
If 
the 
fair 
value 
is 
less 
than 
the 
carrying 
value, 
then 
the 
second 
step 
is 
performed, 
which 
measures 
the 
amount 
of 
impairment 
by 
comparing 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
goodwill 
to 
its 
implied 
fair 
value. 
If 
the 
implied 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
goodwill 
exceeds 
the 
carrying 
amount, 
there 
is 
no 
impairment. 
If 
the 
carrying 
amount 
exceeds 
the 
implied 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
goodwill, 
an 
impairment 
char
ge 
is 
recorded 
for 
the 
excess. 
Identified 
intangible 
assets 
that 
have 
a 
finite 
life 
are 
amortized 
over 
their 
useful 
lives 
and 
are 
evaluated 
for 
impairment 
whenever 
events 
or 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
indicate 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
the

may 
not

The

recognizes 
as

the

to 
service 
mortgage 
loans 
based 
on 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
the

either 
when

the 
associated 
servicing

are 
retained 
or 
when 
servicing

are 
purchased 
from 
a

. 
The 
Company 
has 
elected 
to 
measure 
all 
MSRs 
at 
fair 
value. 
Fair 
value 
is 
determined 
by 
projecting 
net 
servicing 
cash 
flows, 
which 
are 
then 
discounted 
to 
estimate 
the 
fair 
value. 
The 
Company 
actively 
hedges 
its 
MSR™
s 
change 
in 
fair 
value. 
The 
fair 
values 
of 
MSRs 
are 
impacted 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
prepayment 
assumptions, 
discount 
rates, 
delinquency 
rates, 
contractually 
specified 
servicing 
fees, 
servicing 
costs 
and 
underlying 
portfolio 
characteristics. 
The 
underlying 
assumptions 
and 
estimated 
values 
are 
corroborated 
by 
values 
received 
from 
independent 
third 
parties 
and 
comparisons 
to 
market 
transactions. 
The 
carrying 
value 
of 
MSRs 
is 
reported 
on 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets 
in 
other 
intangible 
assets. 
Servicing 
fees 
are 
recognized

Fair 
value 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
price 
that 
would 
be 
received 
to 
sell 
an 
asset 
or 
paid 
to 
transfer 
a 
liability 
in 
an 
orderly 
transaction 
between 
market 
participants 
at 
the 
measurement 
date. 
Depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
asset 
or 
liability
, 
the 
Company 
uses 
various 
valuation 
techniques 
and 
assumptions 
when 
estimating 
fair 
value. 
The 
Company 
prioritizes 
inputs 
used 
in 
valuation 
techniques 
based 
on 
the 
following 
fair 
value 
hierarchy:
Ł 
Level 
1 
Œ 
Assets 
or 
liabilities 
valued 
using 
unadjusted 
quoted 
prices 
in 
active 
markets 
for 
identical 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
that 
the 
Company 
can 
access 
at 
the 
measurement 
date, 
such 
as 
publicly-traded 
instruments 
or 
futures 
contracts.
Ł 
Level 
2

Assets 
and 
liabilities 
valued 
based 
on 
observable 
market 
data 
for 
similar 
instruments.
Ł 
Level 
3 
Œ 
Assets 
or 
liabilities 
for 
which 
significant 
valuation 
assumptions 
are 
not 
readily 
observable 
in 
the 
market; 
instruments 
valued 
based 
on 
the 
best 
available 
data, 
some 
of 
which 
may 
be 
internally 
developed, 
and 
considers 
risk 
premiums 
that 
a 
market 
participant 
would 
require.
When 
measuring 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
fair 
value, 
the 
Company 
considers 
the 
principal 
or 
most 
advantageous 
market 
in 
which 
it 
would 
transact 
and 
considers 
assumptions 
that 
market 
participants 
would 
use 
when 
pricing 
the 
asset 
or 
liability
. 
Assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
are 
required 
to 
be 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
recurring 
basis 
include 
trading 
securities, 
securities 
AFS

and 
derivative 
financial

Other 
assets

at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
non-recurring 
basis, 
such 
as

Standards adopted in 2014
ASU 2014-01, Accounting
for Investments in
Qualified Affordable
Housing Projects
The 
ASU 
allows 
the 
use 
of 
the 
proportional 
amortization 
method 
for 
investments 
in 
qualified 
af
fordable 
housing 
projects 
if 
certain 
conditions 
are 
met. 
Under 
the 
proportional 
amortization 
method, 
the 
initial 
cost 
of 
the 
investment 
is 
amortized 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
tax 
credits 
and 
other 
tax 
benefits 
received 
and 
the 
net 
investment 
performance 
is 
recognized 
in 
the 
income 
statement 
as 
a 
component 
of 
income 
tax 
expense. 
The 
ASU 
provides 
for 
a 
practical 
expedient, 
which 
allows 
for 
amortization 
of 
the 
investment 
in 
proportion 
to 
only 
the 
tax 
credits 
if 
it 
produces 
a 
measurement 
that 
is 
substantially 
similar 
to 
the 
measurement 
that 
would 
result 
from 
using 
both 
tax 
credits 
and 
other 
tax 
benefits.
January 1,
2014
The 
standard 
is 
required 
to 
be 
applied 
retrospectively; 
therefore 
amounts 
included 
in 
noninterest 
expense 
in 
periods 
prior 
to 
adoption 
have 
been 
reclassified. 
For 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2013 
and 
2012, 
$49 
million 
and 
$39 
million, 
respectively
, 
of 
investment 
amortization 
expense 
was 
reclassified 
from 
other 
noninterest 
expense 
to 
provision 
for 
income 
taxes 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of

The 
core 
principle 
of 
the

is 
that 
an

should 
recognize 
revenue 
to 
depict 
the 
transfer 
of 
promised 
goods

to 
customers 
in 
an 
amount 
that

Credit 
Quality 
Evaluation
The 
Company
 
evaluates 
the 
credit 
quality 
of 
its 
loan 
portfolio 
by 
employing 
a 
dual 
internal 
risk 
rating 
system, 
which 
assigns 
both 
PD
 
and 
LGD
 
ratings 
to 
derive 
expected 
losses. 
Assignment 
of 
PD
 
and 
LGD
 
ratings 
are 
predicated 
upon 
numerous 
factors, 
including 
consumer 
credit 
risk 
scores, 
rating 
agency 
information, 
borrower/guarantor 
financial 
capacity
, 
L
TV
 
ratios, 
collateral 
type, 
debt 
service 
coverage 
ratios, 
collection 
experience, 
other 
internal 
metrics/analyses, 
and/or 
qualitative 
assessments.
For 
the 
commercial 
portfolio, 
the 
Company
 
believes 
that 
the 
most 
appropriate 
credit 
quality 
indicator 
is 
an 
individual 
loan™
s 
risk 
assessment 
expressed 
according 
to 
the 
broad 
regulatory 
agency 
classifications 
of 
Pass 
or 
Criticized. 
The 
Company
's 
risk 
rating 
system 
is 
granular
, 
with 
multiple 
risk 
ratings 
in 
both 
the 
Pass 
and 
Criticized 
categories. 
Pass 
ratings 
reflect 
relatively 
low 
PD
s, 
whereas, 
Criticized 
assets 
have 
higher 
PD
s. 
The 
granularity 
in 
Pass 
ratings 
assists 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
pricing, 
loan 
structures, 
approval 
requirements, 
reserves, 
and 
ongoing 
credit 
management 
requirements. 
The 
Company
 
conforms 
to 
the 
following 
regulatory 
classifications 
for 
Criticized 
assets: 
 
Other 
Assets 
Especially 
Mentioned 
(or 
Special 
Mention), 
Adversely 
Classified, 
Doubtful, 
and 
Loss. 
However
, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
disclosure, 
management 
believes 
the 
most 
meaningful 
distinction 
within 
the 
Criticized 
categories 
is 
between 
Accruing 
Criticized 
(which 
includes 
Special 
Mention 
and 
a 
portion 
of 
Adversely 
Classified) 
and 
Nonaccruing 
Criticized 
(which 
includes 
a 
portion 
of 
Adversely 
Classified 
and 
Doubtful 
and 
Loss). 
This 
distinction 
identifies 
those 
relatively 
higher 
risk 
loans 
for 
which 
there 
is 
a 
basis 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
Company
 
will 
collect 
all 
amounts 
due 
from 
those 
where 
full 
collection 
is 
less 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

certain. 
Commercial 
risk 
ratings 
are 
refreshed 
at 
least 
annually
, 
or 
more 
frequently 
as 
appropriate, 
based 
upon 
considerations 
such 
as 
market 
conditions, 
borrower 
characteristics, 
and 
portfolio 
trends. 
Additionally
, 
management 
routinely 
reviews 
portfolio 
risk 
ratings, 
trends, 
and 
concentrations 
to 
support 
risk 
identification 
and 
mitigation 
activities. 
For 
consumer 
and 
residential 
loans, 
the 
Company
 
monitors 
credit 
risk 
based 
on 
indicators 
such 
as 
delinquencies 
and 
FICO
 
scores. 
The 
Company
 
believes 
that 
consumer 
credit 
risk, 
as 
assessed 
by 
the 
industry-wide 
FICO
 
scoring 
method, 
is 
a 
relevant 
credit 
quality 
indicator
. 
Borrower
-specific 
FICO
 
scores 
are 
obtained 
at 
origination 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
formal 
underwriting 
process, 
and 
refreshed 
FICO
 
scores 
are 
obtained 
by 
the 
Company
 
at 
least 
quarterly
. 
For 
government-guaranteed 
loans, 
the 
Company
 
monitors 
the 
credit 
quality 
based 
primarily 
on 
delinquency 
status, 
as 
it 
is 
a 
more 
relevant 
indicator 
of 
credit 
quality 
due 
to 
the 
government 
guarantee. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013

28%

, 
respectively
, 
of 
the 
guaranteed 
residential 
loan 
portfolio 
was 
current 
with 
respect 
to 
payments. 
The 
decline 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
current 
loans 
in 
LHFI
 
is 
solely 
due 
to 
the 
sale 
of 
approximately 
$2.0 
billion
 
in 
accruing 
current 
guaranteed 
residential 
loans 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2014.

, 
respectively
, 
of 
the

respect 
to

Loss 
exposure 
to

by 
the

Restructured 
Loans
TDR
s 
are 
loans 
in 
which 
the 
borrower 
is 
experiencing 
financial 
dif
ficulty 
and 
the 
Company
 
has 
granted 
an 
economic 
concession 
to 
the 
borrower 
that 
the 
Company 
would 
not 
otherwise 
consider
. 
When 
loans 
are 
modified 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
a 
TDR
, 
the 
Company
 
typically 
of
fers 
the 
borrower 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
loan 
maturity 
date 
and/or 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
original 
contractual 
interest 
rate. 
In 
certain 
situations, 
the 
Company
 
may 
of
fer 
to 
restructure 
a 
loan 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
ultimately 
results 
in 
the 
for

contractually 
specified 
principal 
balances.

Concentrations 
of 
Credit 
Risk
The 
Company
 
does 
not 
have 
a 
significant 
concentration 
of 
risk 
to 
any 
individual 
client 
except 
for 
the 
U.S.
 
government 
and 
its 
agencies. 
However
, 
a 
geographic 
concentration 
arises 
because 
the 
Company
 
operates 
primarily 
in 
the 
Southeastern 
and 
Mid-
Atlantic 
regions 
of 
the 
U.S.
 
The 
Company
 
engages 
in 
limited 
international 
banking 
activities. 
The 
Company
™
s 
total 
cross-
border 
outstanding 
loans 
were 
$1.3 
billion
 
and 
$956 
million
 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
respectively
.
The 
major 
concentrations 
of 
credit 
risk 
for 
the 
Company
 
arise 
by 
collateral 
type 
in 
relation 
to 
loans 
and 
credit 
commitments. 
The 
only 
significant 
concentration 
that 
exists 
is 
in 
loans 
secured 
by 
residential 
real 
estate. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
Company
 
owned 
$38.8 
billion
 
in 
residential 
loans, 
representing 
29%
 
of 
total 
LHFI
, 
and 
had 
$10.9 
billion
 
in 
commitments 
to 
extend 
credit 
on 
home 
equity 
lines 
and 
$3.3 
billion
 
in 
mortgage 
loan 
commitments. 
At 
December€31, 
2013
, 
the 
Company
 
owned 
$43.2 
billion
 
in 
residential 
loans, 
representing 
34%
 
of 
total

Goodwill
The 
Company
 
evaluates 
goodwill 
for 
impairment 
each 
year 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
or 
as 
events 
occur 
or 
circumstances 
change 
that 
would 
more-likely-than-not 
reduce 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
below 
its 
carrying 
amount.
The 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
is 
determined 
by 
using 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
analyses 
and, 
when 
applicable, 
guideline 
company 
information. 
The 
carrying 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
is 
determined 
using 
an 
equity 
allocation 
methodology 
that 
allocates 
the 
total 
equity 
of 
the 
Company

each 
of

, 
and 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the

test, 
the 
Company 
determined 
that 
there 
was 
no

When 
a 
transfer

other

occurs 
with 
a 
VIE, 
the 
Company
 
first 
determines 
if 
it

a 
VI

A
 
VI
 
is 
typically 
in 
the 
form 
of

retained 
interests 
in 
transferred 
assets 
and, 
at 
times,

collateral 
manager 
fees. 
If 
the 
Company
 
has 
a 
VI

an

, 
it 
then 
evaluates

not 
it

both 
(1)€the 
power

direct 
the

that 
most 
significantly 
impact 
the

and 
(2)€the 
obligation 
to 
absorb 
losses 
or 
the 
right 
to 
receive 
benefits 
that 
could 
potentially 
be 
significant 
to 
the 
VIE
 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
Company
 
should 
consolidate 
the 
VIE
.
Below

which 
resulted 
in 
pre-tax 
net 
gains 
of 
$224

In 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
securitizations, 
the 
Company
 
has 
received 
securities 
representing 
retained 
interests 
in 
the 
transferred 
loans 
in 
addition 
to 
cash 
(while 
also 
retaining

in

for 
the 
transferred 
loans. 
The 
received 
securities 
are 
carried 
at 
fair

At 
December 
31, 
2014

2013
, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
securities 
received 
totaled 
$55 
million
 
and 
$71 
million
, 
respectively
, 
and 
were 
valued 
using 
a 
third 
party 
pricing 
service.
The 
Company
 
evaluated 
these 
securitization 
transactions 
for 
consolidation 
under 
the 
VIE
 
consolidation 
guidance. 
As 
servicer 
of 
the 
underlying 
loans, 
the 
Company
 
is 
generally 
deemed 
to 
have 
power 
over 
the 
securitization 
entity
. 
However
, 
if 
a 
single 
party
, 
such 
as 
the 
issuer 
or 
the 
master 
servicer
, 
ef
fectively 
controls 
the 
servicing 
activities 
or 
has 
the 
unilateral 
ability 
to 
terminate 
the 
Company
 
as 
servicer 
without 
cause, 
then 
that 
party 
is 
deemed 
to 
have 
power 
over 
the 
entity
. 
In 
almost 
all 
of 
its 
securitization 
transactions, 
the 
Company
 
does 
not 
have 
power 
over 
the 
VIE
 
as 
a 
result 
of 
these 
rights 
held 
by 
the 
master 
servicer
. 
In 
certain 
transactions, 
the 
Company
 
does 
have 
power 
as 
the 
servicer; 
however
, 
the 
Company
 
does 
not 
also 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
absorb 
losses 
or 
the 
right 
to

If

to

concluded 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the

Return 
Swaps
The 
Company 
has 
involvement 
with 
various 
VIEs 
related 
to 
its 
TRS 
business. 
Under 
the 
matched 
book 
TRS 
business 
model, 
the 
VIEs 
purchase 
assets 
(typically 
commercial 
leveraged 
loans) 
from 
the 
market, 
which 
are 
identified 
by 
third 
party 
clients, 
that 
serve 
as 
the 
underlying 
reference 
assets 
for 
a 
TRS 
between 
the 
VIE 
and 
the 
Company 
and 
a

TRS 
between 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
third 
party 
clients. 
The 
TRS 
contracts 
between 
the 
VIEs 
and 
the 
Company 
hedge 
the 
Company™
s 
exposure 
to 
the 
TRS 
contracts 
with 
its 
third 
party 
clients. 
These 
third 
parties 
are 
not 
related 
parties 
to 
the 
Company
, 
nor 
are 
they 
and 
the 
Company 
de 
facto 
agents 
of 
each 
other
. 
In 
order 
for 
the 
VIEs 
to 
purchase 
the 
reference 
assets, 
the 
Company 
provides 
senior 
financing, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
demand 
notes, 
to 
these 
VIEs. 
The 
TRS 
contracts 
pass 
through 
interest 
and 
other 
cash 
flows 
on 
the 
assets 
owned 
by 
the 
VIEs 
to 
the 
third 
parties, 
along 
with 
exposing 
the 
third 
parties 
to 
decreases 
in 
value 
on 
the 
assets 
and 
providing 
them 
with 
the 
rights 
to 
appreciation 
on 
the 
assets. 
The 
terms 
of 
the 
TRS 
contracts 
require 
the 
third 
parties 
to 
post 
initial 
collateral, 
in 
addition 
to 
ongoing 
mar
gin 
as 
the 
fair 
values 
of 
the 
underlying 
assets 
change.
The 
Company 
evaluated 
the 
VIEs 
for 
consolidation, 
noting 
that 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
third 
party 
clients 
are 
the 
VI 
holders. 
As 
such, 
the 
Company 
evaluated 
the 
nature 
of 
all 
VIs 
and 
other 
interests 
and 
involvement 
with 
the 
VIEs, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
purpose 
and 
design 
of 
the 
VIEs, 
relative 
to 
the 
risks 
they 
were 
designed 
to 
create. 
The 
purpose 
and 
design 
of 
a 
VIE 
are 
key 
components 
of 
a 
consolidation 
analysis. 
The 
VIEs 
were 
designed 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
third 
parties 
and 
would 
not 
exist 
if 
the 
Company 
did 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
TRS 
contracts 
with 
the 
third 
parties. 
The 
activities 
of 
the 
VIEs 
are 
restricted 
to 
buying 
and 
selling 
reference 
assets 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
TRS 
contracts 
entered 
into 
between 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
third 
party 
clients 
and 
the 
risks/benefits 
of 
any 
such 
assets 
owned 
by 
the 
VIEs 
are 
passed 
to 
the 
third 
party 
clients 
via 
the 
TRS 
contracts. 
The 
TRS 
contracts 
between 
the 
Company 
and 
its 
third 
party 
clients 
have 
a 
substantive 
ef
fect 
on 
the 
design 
of 
the 
overall 
transaction 
and 
the 
VIEs. 
Based 
on 
its 
evaluation, 
the 
Company 
has 
determined 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
primary 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
VIEs, 
as 
the 
design 
of 
the 
TRS 
business 
results 
in 
the 
Company 
having 
no 
substantive 
power 
to 
direct 
the 
significant 
activities 
of 
the 
VIEs.
At 
December 
31, 
2014

the

nature 
of 
these

The

As

In 
limited 
circumstances, 
the 
Company 
owns 
both 
the

in 
which 
case 
the 
related

are 
not

are

The 
Company 
consolidated 
its 
af
fordable 
housing 
partnerships 
under 
such 
circumstances, 
and 
has 
designated 
those 
partnerships 
as 
held 
for 
sale, 
and 
accordingly 
has 
recognized 
them 
at 
the 
lower 
of 
their 
carrying 
value 
or 
estimated 
fair 
value 
less 
costs

At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
value 
of 
properties 
held 
for

was

and 
disposition 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
the 
first

.
When 
the 
Company 
is 
the 
limited 
partner 
and 
there 
is 
a 
third 
party 
general 
partner
, 
the 
Company 
has 
determined 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
primary 
beneficiary 
of 
these

accounts 
for 
its 
interest 
in

with 
the

Often 
times, 
the 
general 
partner 
or 
an 
af

of 
the

to 
the

the

from 
losses 
attributable 
to 
operating

credit 
allocation 
deficits. 
Assets 
of 
$1.6

The

The 
dif
ference 
between 
the 
maximum 
exposure

Stock-Based 
Compensation
The 
Company
 
provides 
stock-based 
awards 
through 
the 
2009 
Stock 
Plan 
under 
which 
the 
Compensation 
Committee 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
has 
the 
authority 
to 
grant 
stock 
options, 
stock 
appreciation 
rights, 
restricted 
stock, 
and 
RSU
s 
to 
key 
employees 
of 
the 
Company
. 
Some 
awards 
may 
have 
performance 
or 
other 
conditions, 
such 
as 
vesting 
tied 
to 
the 
Company
's 
total 
shareholder 
return 
relative 
to 
a 
peer 
group 
or 
vesting 
tied 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
an 
absolute 
financial 
performance 
tar
get. 
On 
January 
9, 
2014 
the 
Compensation 
Committee 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
approved, 
subject 
to 
shareholder 
approval, 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
2009 
Stock 
Plan 
as 
amended 
and 
restated 
ef
fective 
January 
1, 
2014, 
to 
remove 
the 
sub-limit 
on 
shares 
available 
for 
grant 
that 
may 
be 
issued 
as 
restricted 
stock 
or 
RSU
s. 
Following 
shareholder 
approval 
of 
the 
Plan 
amendment, 
which 
occurred 
on 
April 
22, 
2014, 
all 
of 
the 
17 
million
 
remaining 
authorized 
shares 
previously 
under 
the 
Plan 
became 
available 
for 
grant 
as 
stock 
options, 
stock 
appreciation 
rights, 
restricted 
stock, 
or 
RSUs. 
Prior 
to 
the 
Plan 
amendment, 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
such 
shares 
were 
available 
to 
be 
granted 
as 
either 
restricted 
stock 
or 
RSU
s. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014
, 
approximately 
18 
million
 
shares 
were 
available 
for 
grant.
Shares 
or 
units 
of 
restricted 
stock 
may 
be 
granted 
to 
employees 
and 
directors. 
Generally
, 
grants 
to 
employees 
either 
clif
f 
vest 
after 
three 
years 
or 
vest 
pro 
rata 
annually 
over 
three 
years. 
Restricted 
stock 
grants 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
one 
or 
more 
criteria, 
including 
employment, 
performance, 
or 
other 
conditions 
as 
established 
by 
the 
Compensation 
Committee 
at 
the 
time 
of 
grant. 
Any 
shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
that 
are 
forfeited 
will 
again 
become 
available 
for 
issuance 
under 
the 
Stock 
Plan. 
An 
employee 
or 
director 
has 
the 
right 
to 
vote 
the 
shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
after 
grant 
unless 
and 
until 
they 
are 
forfeited. 
Compensation 
cost 
for 
restricted 
stock 
and 
RSU
s 
is 
generally 
equal 
to 
the 
fair 
market 
value 
of 
the 
shares 
on 
the 
grant 
date 
of 
the 
award 
and 
is 
amortized 
to 
compensation 
expense 
over 
the 
vesting 
period. 
Dividends 
are 
paid 
on 
awarded 
but 
unvested 
restricted 
stock. 
The 
Company 
accrues 
and 
reinvests 
dividends 
in 
equivalent 
shares 
of 
SunT
rust 
common 
stock 
for 
unvested 
RSU 
awards, 
which 
are 
paid 
out 
only 
when 
the 
underlying 
RSU 
award 
vests. 
Generally
, 
RSU 
awards 
are 
classified 
as 
equity
. 
However
, 
during 
2012 
there 
were 
574,257
 
RSUs 
granted 
that 
were 
classified 
as 
a 
liability 
because 
the 
grant 
date 
had 
not 
been 
achieved 
as 
defined 
under 
U.S. 
GAAP
. 
The 
awards 
were 
granted 
with 
a 
fair 
value 
of 
$21.67
 
per 
unit 
on 
the 
grant 
date. 
The 
balance 
of 
these 
RSUs 
classified 
as 
a 
liability 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
 
was 
$21 
million
 
and 
$17 
million
, 
respectively
.
Consistent 
with 
the 
Company's 
decision 
to 
discontinue 
the 
issuance 
of 
stock 
options 
in 
2014, 
no 
stock 
options 
were 
granted 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014
. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
option 
grants 
was 
estimated 
on 
the 
date 
of 
grant 
using 
the 
Black-

The 
expected 
volatility 
represented 
the 
implied 
volatility 
of 
SunT
rust 
stock. 
The 
expected 
term 
represented 
the 
period 
of 
time 
that 
the 
stock 
options 
granted 
were 
expected 
to 
be 
outstanding 
and 
was 
derived 
from 
historical 
data 
that 
was 
used 
to 
evaluate 
patterns 
such 
as 
stock 
option 
exercise 
and 
employee 
termination. 
The 
Company 
used 
the 
projected 
dividend 
to 
be 
paid 
as 
the 
dividend 
yield 
assumption. 
The 
risk-free 
interest 
rate 
is

from 
the 
U.S. 
T
reasury

curve 
in 
ef
fect 
at 
the 
time 
of 
grant 
based 
on 
the 
expected 
life 
of 
the 
option. 
Stock 
options 
were 
granted 
at 
an 
exercise 
price 
that 
was 
no 
less 
than 
the 
fair 
market 
value 
of 
a 
share 
of 
SunT
rust
 
common 
stock 
on 
the 
grant 
date 
and 
were 
either 
tax-qualified 
incentive 
stock 
options 
or 
non-qualified 
stock 
options. 
Stock 
options 
typically 
vest 
pro-rata 
over 
three 
years 
and 
generally 
have 
a 
maximum 
contractual 
life 
of 
ten 
years. 
Upon 
exercise, 
shares 
are 
generally 
issued 
from 
treasury 
stock.

value 
of 
options 
granted

The 
Company 
monitors 
the

of 
the

closely 
and 
due 
to 
the 
current

the

noncontributory

("Retirement 
Benefit

for 
the

. 
The

unfunded, 
noncontributory 
nonqualified 
supplemental

that

of 
the

Inc. 
Restoration 
Plan 
(the 
ﬁRestoration 
Planﬂ), 
ef
fective 
January

is 
a 
nonqualified 
defined 
benefit 
cash 
balance 
plan 
designed 
to 
restore 
benefits 
to 
certain 
employees 
that 
are 
limited 
under 
provisions 
of 
the 
Internal 
Revenue 
Code 
and 
are 
not 
otherwise 
provided 
for 
under 
the 
ERISA
 
Excess 
Plan. 
The 
benefit 
formula 
under 
the 
Restoration 
Plan 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
PP
A
 
under 
the 
Retirement 
Plan.
On 
October€1, 
2004, 
the 
Company 
acquired 
NCF
. 
Prior 
to 
the 
acquisition, 
NCF
 
sponsored 
a 
funded 
qualified 
retirement 
plan, 
an 
unfunded 
nonqualified 
retirement 
plan 
for 
some 
of 
its 
participants, 
and 
certain 
other 
postretirement 
health 
benefits 
for 
its 
employees. 
Similar 
to 
the 
Company's 
Retirement 
Plan, 
due 
to 
the 
current 
funding 
status 
of 
the 
NCF
 
qualified 
Retirement 
Plan, 
the 
Company 
did 
not 
make 
a 
contribution 
for 
the 
2014
 
plan 
year
. 
The 
Retirement 
Plan, 
the 
SERP
, 
the 
ERISA
 
Excess 
Plan, 
and 
the 
Restoration 
Plan 
were 
each 
amended 
on 
November 
14, 
201

to 
cease 
all 
future 
benefit 
accruals. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
traditional 
pension 
benefit 
formulas 
(final 
average 
pay 
formulas) 
do 
not 
reflect 
future 
salary 
increases 
and 
benefit 
service

December 
31, 
201
1, 
and 
compensation 
credits 
under 
the 
Personal 
Pension

(cash 
balance 
formula) 
ceased. 
However
, 
interest 
credits 
under 
the 
Personal 
Pension 
Accounts 
continue 
to 
accrue 
until 
benefits 
are 
distributed 
and 
service 
continues 
to 
be 
recognized 
for 
vesting 
and 
eligibility 
requirements 
for 
early 
retirement. 
Additionally

the 
NCF 
Retirement

which 
had 
been 
previously

with 
respect

benefits 
if

at 
any

Ef
fective 
April 
1, 
2014, 
the 
Company 
amended 
the 
plan 
which 
now 
requires 
retirees 
age 
65 
and 
older 
to 
enroll 
in 
individual 
Medicare 
supplemental 
plans.€In 
addition, 
the 
Company 
will 
fund 
a 
tax-advantaged 
HRA
 
to 
assist 
some 
retirees 
with 
medical 
expenses.€
The 
plan 
amendment 
was 
measured 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2013 
and 
resulted 
in 
a 
decrease 
of 
$76 
million
 
in 
the 
liability 
and 
AOCI 
for 
the 
postretirement 
benefits 
plan. 
The 
Company 
contributed 
less 
than 
$1 
million
 
to 
the 
Postretirement 
W
elfare 
Plan 
during 
the 
year 
ended 
December

pre-tax 
long-term 
rate 
of 
return

for

is 
5.00%
 
for

.
Assumptions
Each 
year
, 
the 
SBFC
, 
which 
includes 
several 
members 
of 
senior 
management, 
reviews 
and 
approves 
the 
assumptions 
used 
in 
the 
year
-end 
measurement 
calculations 
for 
each 
plan. 
The 
discount 
rate 
for 
each 
plan, 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
present 
value 
of 
future 
benefit 
obligations, 
is 
determined 
by 
matching 
the 
expected 
cash 
flows 
of 
each 
plan 
to 
a 
yield 
curve 
based 
on 
long-term, 
high 
quality 
fixed 
income 
debt 
instruments 
available 
as 
of 
the 
measurement 
date. 
A
 
series 
of 
benefit 
payments 
projected 
to 
be 
paid 
by 
the 
plan 
is 
developed 
based 
on 
the 
most 
recent 
census 
data, 
plan 
provisions, 
and 
assumptions. 
The 
benefit 
payments 
at 
each 
future 
maturity 
date 
are 
discounted 
by 
the 
year
-appropriate 
spot 
interest 
rates. 
The 
model 
then 
solves 
for 
the 
discount 
rate 
that 
produces 
the 
same 
present 
value 
of 
the 
projected 
benefit 
payments 
as 
generated 
by 
discounting 
each 
year
™
s 
payments 
by 
the 
spot 
interest 
rate. 
Actuarial 
gains 
and 
losses 
are 
created 
when 
actual 
experience 
deviates 
from 
assumptions. 
The 
actuarial 
losses 
on 
obligations 
generated 
within 
the 
pension 
plans 
during 
2014
 
resulted 
primarily 
from 
lower 
interest 
rates. 
The 
actuarial 
gains 
during 
2013
 
resulted 
primarily 
from 
higher 
interest 
rates 
and 
better 
than 
expected 
asset 
returns.

. 
The 
Company™
s 
investment 
strategy 
with 
respect 
to 
pension 
assets 
is 
to 
invest 
the 
assets 
in 
accordance 
with 
ERISA
 
and 
related 
fiduciary 
standards. 
The 
long-term 
primary 
investment 
objectives 
for 
the 
pension 
plans 
are 
to 
provide 
a 
commensurate 
amount 
of 
long-term 
growth 
of 
capital 
(both 
principal 
and 
income) 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
the 
pension 
plan 
obligations 
without 
undue 
exposure 
to 
risk 
in 
any 
single 
asset 
class 
or

category
. 
The 
objectives 
are 
accomplished 
through 
investments 
in 
equities, 
fixed 
income, 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
using 
a 
mix 
that 
is 
conducive 
to 
participation 
in 
a 
rising 
market 
while 
allowing 
for 
protection 
in 
a 
declining 
market. 
The

viewed 
as 
long-term 
in 
its 
entirety

The 
basis 
for 
determining 
the 
overall 
expected 
long-term 
rate 
of 
return 
on 
plan 
assets 
considers 
past 
experience, 
current 
market 
conditions, 
and 
expectations 
on 
future 
trends. 
A
 
building

approach 
is

GUARANTEES
The 
Company
 
has 
undertaken 
certain 
guarantee 
obligations 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
business. 
The 
issuance 
of 
a 
guarantee 
imposes 
an 
obligation 
for 
the 
Company
 
to 
stand 
ready 
to 
perform 
and 
make 
future 
payments 
should 
certain 
triggering 
events 
occur
. 
Payments 
may 
be 
in 
the 
form 
of 
cash, 
financial 
instruments, 
other 
assets, 
shares 
of 
stock, 
or 
provision 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
services. 
The 
following 
is 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
guarantees 
that 
the 
Company
 
has 
issued 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
Company
 
has 
also 
entered 
into 
certain 
contracts 
that 
are 
similar 
to 
guarantees, 
but 
that 
are 
accounted 
for 
as 
derivatives 
as 
discussed 
in 
Note 
17
, 
ﬁDerivative 
Financial 
Instruments.ﬂ
Letters 
of 
Cr
edit
Letters 
of 
credit 
are 
conditional 
commitments 
issued 
by 
the 
Company
, 
generally 
to 
guarantee 
the 
performance 
of 
a 
client 
to 
a 
third 
party 
in 
borrowing 
arrangements, 
such 
as 
CP
, 
bond 
financing, 
and 
similar 
transactions. 
The 
credit 
risk 
involved 
in 
issuing 
letters 
of 
credit 
is 
essentially 
the 
same 
as 
that 
involved 
in 
extending 
loan 
facilities 
to 
clients 
and 
may 
be 
reduced 
by 
selling 
participations 
to 
third 
parties. 
The 
Company
 
issues 
letters 
of 
credit 
that 
are 
classified 
as 
financial 
standby
, 
performance 
standby
, 
or 
commercial 
letters 
of 
credit.
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
the 
maximum 
potential 
amount 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
obligation 
for 
issued 
financial 
and 
performance 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
was 
$3.0 
billion
 
and 
$3.3 
billion
, 
respectively
. 
The 
Company
™
s 
outstanding 
letters 
of 
credit 
generally 
have 
a 
term 
of 
less 
than 
one 
year 
but 
may 
extend 
longer
. 
Some 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
are 
designed 
to 
be 
drawn 
upon 
and 
others 
are 
drawn 
upon 
only 
under 
circumstances 
of 
dispute 
or 
default 
in 
the 
underlying 
transaction 
to 
which 
the 
Company
 
is 
not 
a 
party
. 
In 
all 
cases, 
the 
Company
 
is 
entitled 
to 
reimbursement 
from 
the 
applicant. 
If 
a 
letter 
of 
credit 
is 
drawn 
upon 
and 
reimbursement 
is 
not 
provided 
by 
the 
applicant, 
the 
Company
 
may 
take 
possession 
of 
the 
collateral 
securing 
the 
line 
of 
credit, 
where 
applicable. 
The 
Company
 
monitors 
its 
credit 
exposure 
under 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
it 
monitors 
other 
extensions 
of 
credit 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
credit 
policies. 
An 
internal 
assessment 
of 
the 
PD
 
and 
loss 
severity 
in 
the 
event 
of 
default 
is 
performed 
consistent 
with 
the 
methodologies 
used 
for 
all 
commercial 
borrowers. 
The 
management 
of 
credit 
risk 
regarding 
letters 
of 
credit 
leverages 
the 
risk 
rating 
process 
to 
focus 
greater 
visibility 
on 
higher 
risk 
and/or 
higher 
dollar 
letters 
of 
credit. 
The 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
associated 
with 
letters 
of 
credit 
is 
a 
component 
of 
the 
unfunded 
commitments 
reserve 
recorded 
in 
other 
liabilities 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets 
and 
is

Losses.ﬂ 
Additionally
, 
unearned 
fees 
relating

are 
recorded 
in 
other

The 
net

$5

, 
and 
non-

Prior

the 
Company
 
also 
sold 
loans 
through 
a 
limited 
number

When

representations

Subsequent

These

life 
of 
the 
mortgage

STM
™
s 
risk 
of 
loss 
under 
its 
representations 
and 
warranties 
is 
partially 
driven 
by 
borrower

performance 
since 
investors 
will 
perform 
extensive 
reviews 
of 
delinquent 
loans 
as 
a 
means 
of 
mitigating 
losses.
Non-agency 
loan 
sales 
include 
whole

sales 
and 
loans 
sold 
in 
private 
securitization 
transactions. 
While 
representations 
and 
warranties 
have 
been 
made 
related 
to

they 
dif
fer 
from 
those 
made 
in

sold 
to 
the 
GSE
s 
in 
that 
non-agency

required 
to 
demonstrate 
that

A
 
significant 
degree 
of 
judgment 
is 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
mortgage 
repurchase 
liability 
as 
the 
estimation 
process 
is 
inherently 
uncertain 
and 
subject 
to 
imprecision. 
The 
Company
 
believes 
that 
its 
reserve 
appropriately 
estimates 
incurred 
losses 
based 
on 
its 
current 
analysis 
and 
assumptions, 
inclusive 
of 
the 
Freddie 
Mac
 
and 
Fannie 
Mae
 
settlement 
agreements, 
GSE
 
owned 
loans 
serviced 
by 
third 
party 
servicers, 
loans 
sold 
to 
private 
investors, 
and 
future 
indemnifications. 
However
, 
the 
2013 
agreements 
with 
Freddie 
Mac
 
and 
Fannie 
Mae
 
settling 
certain 
aspects 
of 
the 
Company
's 
repurchase 
obligations 
preserve 
their 
right 
to 
require 
repurchases 
arising 
from 
certain 
types 
of 
events, 
and 
that 
preservation 
of 
rights 
can 
impact 
future 
losses 
of 
the 
Company
. 
While 
the 
repurchase 
reserve 
includes 
the 
estimated 
cost 
of 
settling 
claims 
related 
to 
required 
repurchases, 
the 
Company
's 
estimate 
of 
losses 
depends 
on 
its 
assumptions 
regarding 
GSE
 
and 
other 
counterparty 
behavior
, 
loan 
performance, 
home 
prices, 
and 
other 
factors. 
The 
liability 
is 
recorded 
in 
other 
liabilities 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheets, 
and 
the 
related 
repurchase 
provision 
is 
recognized 
as 
a 
contra-
revenue 
item 
in 
mortgage 
production 
related 
income 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income.

the 
carrying 
value 
of 
outstanding 
repurchased 
mortgage 
loans,

In 
addition 
to 
representations 
and 
warranties 
related 
to 
loan 
sales, 
the 
Company
 
makes 
representations 
and 
warranties 
that 
it 
will 
service 
the 
loans 
in 
accordance 
with 
investor 
servicing 
guidelines 
and 
standards, 
which 
may 
include 
(i) 
collection 
and 
remittance 
of 
principal 
and

(ii) 
administration 
of 
escrow

accounts, 
(iv) 
loss 
mitigation 
strategies 
including 
loan 
modifications,

The

rights

transferred;

servicing 
rights 
are 
occasionally 
sold

Contingent 
Consideration
The 
Company
 
has 
contingent 
payment 
obligations 
related 
to 
certain 
business 
combination 
transactions. 
Payments 
are 
calculated 
using 
certain 
post-acquisition 
performance 
criteria. 
The 
potential 
obligation 
is 
recorded 
as 
an 
other 
liability
, 
measured 
at 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
contingent

cause

The

is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
3.2

caused 
by 
the

During 
2012, 
the 
Card 
Associations 
and 
defendants 
signed 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
settlement 
agreement 
to 
resolve 
the 
plaintif
fs' 
claims 
in 
the 
Litigation. 
V
isa
's 
share 
of 
the 
claims 
represents 
approximately 
$4.4 
billion
, 
which 
was 
paid 
from 
the 
escrow 
account 
into 
a 
settlement 
fund 
during 
2012. 
During 
2013, 
various 
members 
of 
the 
putative 
class 
elected 
to 
opt 
out 
of 
the 
settlement 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
proportional 
decrease 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
settlement 
and 
a 
deposit 
of 
approximately 
$1.0 
billion
 
from 
the 
settlement 
fund 
back 
into 
the 
escrow 
account. 
During 
2014, 
V

an

$450

$1.5

Public 
Deposits
The 
Company 
holds 
public 
deposits 
from 
various 
states 
in 
which 
it 
does 
business. 
Individual 
state 
laws 
require 
banks 
to 
collateralize 
public 
deposits, 
typically 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
their 
public 
deposit 
balance 
in 
excess 
of 
FDIC
 
insurance 
and 
may 
also 
require 
a 
cross-guarantee 
among 
all 
banks 
holding 
public 
deposits 
of 
the 
individual 
state. 
The 
amount 
of 
collateral 
required 
varies 
by 
state 
and 
may 
also 
vary 
by 
institution 
within 
each 
state, 
depending 
on 
the 
individual 
state's 
risk 
assessment 
of 
depository 
institutions. 
Certain 
of 
the 
states 
in 
which 
the 
Company 
holds 
public 
deposits 
use 
a 
pooled 
collateral 
method, 
whereby 
in 
the 
event 
of 
default 
of 
a 
bank 
holding 
public 
deposits, 
the 
collateral 
of 
the 
defaulting

is 
liquidated 
to 
the 
extent 
necessary 
to 
recover 
the 
loss 
of 
public 
deposits 
of 
the

T
o 
the 
extent 
the 
collateral 
is 
insuf
ficient, 
the 
remaining 
public 
deposit 
balances 
of 
the 
defaulting 
bank 
are 
recovered

an 
assessment 
of 
the 
other 
banks 
holding 
public 
deposits 
in 
that 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

state. 
The 
maximum 
potential 
amount 
of 
future 
payments 
the 
Company 
could 
be 
required 
to 
make 
is 
dependent 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
the 
amount 
of 
public 
funds 
held 
by 
banks 
in 
the 
states 
in 
which 
the 
Company 
also 
holds 
public 
deposits 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
collateral 
coverage 
associated 
with 
any 
defaulting 
bank. 
Individual 
states 
appear 
to 
be 
monitoring 
this 
risk 
and 
evaluating 
collateral 
requirements; 
therefore, 
the 
likelihood 
that 
the 
Company 
would 
have 
to 
perform 
under 
this 
guarantee 
is 
dependent 
on 
whether 
any 
banks 
holding 
public 
funds 
default 
as 
well 
as 
the 
adequacy 
of 
collateral 
coverage.
Other
In 
the 
normal 
course 
of 
business, 
the 
Company 
enters 
into 
indemnification 
agreements 
and 
provides 
standard 
representations 
and 
warranties 
in 
connection 
with 
numerous 
transactions. 
These 
transactions 
include 
those 
arising 
from

The

of 
the 
Company's 
obligations 
under 
these

depends 
upon 
the 
occurrence 
of 
future

broker 
for 
losses 
that 
result 
from 
a 
customer's 
failure

As 
the

broker's 
rights 
to

Credit 
and 
Market 
Risk 
Associated 
with 
Derivatives
Derivatives 
expose 
the 
Company
 
to 
counterparty 
credit 
risk 
if 
counterparties 
to 
the 
derivative 
contracts 
do 
not 
perform 
as 
expected. 
The 
Company
 
minimizes 
the 
credit 
risk 
of 
derivatives 
by 
entering 
into 
transactions 
with 
counterparties 
with 
defined 
exposure 
limits 
based 
on 
credit 
quality 
that 
are 
reviewed 
periodically 
by 
the 
Company
™
s 
Credit 
Risk 
Management 
division. 
The 
Company

s 
derivatives 
may 
also 
be 
governed 
by 
an 
ISDA
 
or 
other 
master 
agreement, 
and 
depending 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
derivative, 
bilateral 
collateral 
agreements. 
The 
Company
 
is 
subject 
to 
OTC
 
derivative 
clearing 
requirements 
as 
a 
registered 
swap 
dealer
, 
which 
requires 
certain 
derivatives 
to 
be 
cleared 
through 
central 
clearing 
members 
in 
which 
the 
Company
 
is 
required 
to 
post 
initial

is 
received 
or 
paid 
daily 
based 
on 
the 
net 
asset 
or

position 
of 
the 
contracts. 
When 
the 
Company
 
has 
more 
than 
one 
outstanding 
derivative 
transaction 
with 
a 
single 
counterparty 
and 
there 
exists 
a 
legal 
right 
of 
of
fset 
with 
that 
counterparty
, 
the 
Company
 
considers 
its 
exposure 
to 
the 
counterparty 
to 
be 
the 
net 
market 
value 
of 
its 
derivative 
positions 
with 
that 
counterparty
. 
If 
the 
net 
market 
value 
is 
positive, 
then 
the 
counterparty 
asset 
value 
also 
reflects 
held 
collateral. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
these 
net 
derivative 
asset

were 
$1.1

other

of 
$386

that 
the

to 
these 
gain 
positions. 
At 
December€31, 
2013
, 
net

positions 
were 
$1.0

representing 
$1.5

of 
derivative 
net

adjusted 
for

of 
$523 
million
 
that 
the 
Company
 
held 
in 
relation 
to 
these 
gain 
positions.
Derivatives 
also 
expose 
the 
Company
 
to 
market 
risk. 
Market 
risk 
is 
the 
adverse 
ef
fect 
that 
a 
change 
in 
market 
factors, 
such 
as 
interest 
rates, 
currency 
rates, 
equity 
prices, 
commodity 
prices, 
or 
implied 
volatility
, 
has 
on 
the 
value 
of 
a 
derivative. 
Under 
an 
established 
risk 
governance 
framework, 
the 
Company
 
comprehensively 
manages 
the 
market 
risk 
associated 
with 
its 
derivatives 
by 
establishing 
and 
monitoring 
limits 
on 
the 
types 
and 
degree 
of 
risk 
that 
may 
be 
undertaken. 
The 
Company
 
continually 
measures 
this 
risk 
associated 
with 
its 
derivatives 
designated 
as 
trading 
instruments 
using 
a 
V
AR
 
methodology
. 
Other 
tools 
and 
risk 
measures 
are 
also 
used 
to 
actively 
manage 
derivatives 
risk 
including 
scenario 
analysis 
and 
stress 
testing.
Derivative 
instruments 
are 
priced 
with 
observable 
market 
assumptions 
at 
a 
mid-market 
valuation 
point, 
with 
appropriate 
valuation 
adjustments 
for 
liquidity 
and 
credit 
risk. 
For 
purposes 
of 
valuation 
adjustments 
to 
its 
derivative 
positions, 
the 
Company
 
has 
evaluated 
liquidity 
premiums 
that 
may 
be 
demanded 
by 
market 
participants, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
credit 
risk 
of 
its 
counterparties 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued
130
and 
its 
own 
credit. 
The 
Company
 
has 
considered 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
likelihood 
of 
default 
by 
itself 
and 
its 
counterparties, 
its 
net 
exposures, 
and 
remaining 
maturities 
in 
determining 
the 
appropriate 
fair 
value 
adjustments 
to 
recognize. 
Generally
, 
the 
expected 
loss 
of 
each 
counterparty 
is 
estimated 
using 
the 
Company
™
s 
internal 
risk 
rating 
system. 
The 
risk 
rating 
system 
utilizes 
counterparty-specific 
PD
 
and 
LGD
 
estimates 
to 
derive 
the 
expected 
loss. 
During 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
the 
Company 
enhanced 
its 
approach 
toward 
determining 
fair 
value 
adjustments 
of 
derivatives 
by 
leveraging 
publicly 
available 
counterparty 
information. 
In 
particular
, 
for 
purposes 
of 
determining 
the 
CV
A
, 
the 
Company 
started 
incorporating 
market-based 
views 
of 
counterparty 
default 
probabilities 
derived 
from 
observed 
credit 
spreads 
in 
the 
CDS
 
market 
when 
data 
of 
acceptable 
quality 
was 
available. 
This 
enhanced 
approach 
did 
not 
have 
a 
material 
impact 
on 
the 
Company's 
financial 
position, 
results 
of 
operations, 
or 
cash 
flows. 
For 
purposes 
of 
estimating 
the 
Company™
s 
own 
credit 
risk 
on 
derivative 
liability 
positions, 
the 
DV
A
, 
the 
Company 
began 
using 
market-based 
probabilities 
of 
default 
from 
observed 
credit 
spreads 
of 
Company-specific 
CDS
. 
Additionally
, 
counterparty 
exposure 
is 
evaluated 
by 
of
fsetting 
derivatives 
positions 
that 
are 
subject 
to 
legally 
enforceable 
master 
netting 
arrangements, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
considering 
the 
amount 
of 
marketable 
collateral 
securing 
the 
positions. 
All 
counterparties 
and 
defined 
exposure 
limits 
are 
explicitly 
approved 
under 
established 
internal 
policies 
and 
procedures. 
Counterparties 
are 
regularly 
reviewed 
and 
appropriate 
business 
action 
is 
taken 
to 
adjust 
the 
exposure 
to 
certain 
counterparties 
as 
necessary
. 
The 
Company
 
adjusted 
the 
net 
fair 
value 
of 
its 
derivative 
contracts 
for 
estimates 
of 
net 
counterparty 
credit 
risk 
by 
approximately 
$7 
million
 
and 
$13 
million
 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
respectively
.
Currently
, 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
derivatives 
contain 
contingencies 
that 
relate 
to 
the 
creditworthiness 
of 
the 
Bank
. 
These 
contingencies, 
which 
are 
contained 
in 
industry 
standard 
master 
netting 
agreements, 
may 
be 
considered 
events 
of 
default. 
Should 
the 
Bank
 
be 
in 
default 
under 
any 
of 
these 
provisions, 
the 
Bank
™
s 
counterparties 
would 
be 
permitted 
to 
close-out 
net 
at 
amounts 
that 
would 
approximate 
the 
then-fair 
values 
of 
the 
derivatives, 
resulting 
in 
a 
single 
sum 
due 
by 
one 
party 
to 
the 
other
. 
The 
counterparties 
would 
have 
the 
right 
to 
apply 
any 
collateral 
posted 
by 
the 
Bank
 
against 
any 
net 
amount 
owed 
by 
the 
Bank
. 
Additionally
, 
certain 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
derivative 
liability 
positions, 
totaling 
$1.1 
billion
 
and 
$941 
million
 
in 
fair 
value 
at 
December€31, 
2014
 
and 
2013, 
respectively
, 
contain 
provisions 
conditioned 
on 
downgrades 
of 
the 
Bank
™
s 
credit 
rating. 
These 
provisions, 
if 
triggered, 
would 
either 
give 
rise 
to 
an 
A
TE
 
that 
permits 
the 
counterparties 
to 
close-

net 
and 
apply 
collateral 
or
, 
where 
a 
CSA
 
is 
present, 
require 
the 
Bank
 
to 
post 
additional 
collateral. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
the 
Bank
 
carried 
senior 
long-term 
debt 
ratings 
of 
A3/A-/BBB+ 
from

. 
At

, 
A
TE
s 
have 
been 
triggered 
for 
approximately 
$1 
million
 
in 
fair 
value 
liabilities. 
The 
maximum 
additional 
liability 
that 
could 
be 
triggered 
from 
A
TE
s 
was 
approximately 
$27 
million
 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
$1.1 
billion
 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
derivative 
liabilities 
were 
subject 
to 
CSA

against 
which 
the 
Bank
 
has 
posted 
$1.0 
billion
 
in 
collateral, 
primarily 
in 
the 
form 
of 
cash. 
If 
requested 
by 
the 
counterparty 
pursuant 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
CSA
, 
the 
Bank
 
would 
be 
required 
to 
post

, 
of 
$20

Credit 
Derivatives
As 
part 
of 
its 
trading 
businesses, 
the 
Company
 
enters 
into 
contracts 
that 
are, 
in 
form 
or 
substance, 
written 
guarantees: 
specifically
, 
CDS
, 
risk 
participations, 
and 
TRS
. 
The 
Company
 
accounts 
for 
these 
contracts 
as 
derivatives 
and, 
accordingly
, 
recognizes 
these 
contracts 
at 
fair 
value, 
with 
changes 
in 
fair 
value 
recognized 
in 
trading 
income 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income.
The 
Company
 
writes 
CDS
, 
which 
are 
agreements 
under 
which 
the 
Company
 
receives 
premium 
payments 
from 
its 
counterparty 
for 
protection 
against 
an 
event 
of 
default 
of 
a 
reference 
asset. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
default 
under 
the 
CDS
, 
the 
Company
 
would 
either 
net 
cash 
settle 
or 
make 
a 
cash 
payment 
to 
its 
counterparty 
and 
take 
delivery 
of 
the 
defaulted 
reference 
asset, 
from 
which 
the 
Company
 
may 
recover 
all, 
a 
portion, 
or 
none 
of 
the 
credit 
loss, 
depending 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
reference 
asset. 
Events 
of 
default, 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
CDS
 
agreements, 
are 
generally 
triggered 
upon 
the 
failure 
to 
pay 
and 
similar 
events 
related 
to 
the 
issuer(s) 
of 
the 
reference 
asset. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
all 
written 
CDS
 
contracts 
reference 
single 
name 
corporate 
credits 
or 
corporate 
credit 
indices. 
When 
the 
Company
 
has 
written 
CDS
, 
it 
has 
generally 
entered 
into 
of
fsetting 
CDS
 
for 
the 
underlying 
reference 
asset, 
under 
which 
the 
Company
 
paid 
a 
premium 
to 
its 
counterparty 
for 
protection 
against 
an 
event 
of 
default 
on 
the 
reference 
asset. 
The 
counterparties 
to 
these 
purchased 
CDS
 
are 
generally 
of 
high 
creditworthiness 
and 
typically 
have 
ISDA
 
master 
netting 
agreements 
in 
place 
that 
subject 
the 
CDS
 
to 
master 
netting 
provisions, 
thereby 
mitigating 
the 
risk 
of 
non-payment 
to 
the 
Company
. 
As 
such, 
at 
December 
31, 
2014
, 
the 
Company
 
did 
not 
have 
any 
material 
risk 
of 
making 
a 
non-recoverable 
payment 
on 
any 
written 
CDS
. 
During 
2014
 
and 
2013
, 
the 
only 
instances 
of 
default 
on 
written 
CDS
 
were 
driven 
by 
credit 
indices 
with 
constituent 
credit 
default. 
In 
all 
cases 
where 
the 
Company
 
made 
resulting 
cash 
payments 
to 
settle, 
the 
Company
 
collected 
like 
amounts 
from 
the 
counterparties 
to 
the 
of
fsetting 
purchased 
CDS
. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
 
and 
2013, 
the 
written 
CDS
 
had 
remaining 
terms 
of 
four 
years
. 
The 
fair 
values 
of 
written 
CDS
 
were 
$1 
million
 
and 
$3 
million
 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
,

, 
as 
measured 
by

CDS
, 
were 
$20

and 
$60

the 
Company
 
typically 
receives 
initial 
cash 
collateral 
from 
the 
counterparty 
upon 
entering 
into 
the 
TRS
 
and 
is 
entitled 
to 
additional 
collateral 
if 
the 
fair

of 
the 
underlying 
reference

deteriorates. 
At 
December

there 
were 
$2.3

Cash 
Flow 
Hedges
The 
Company
 
utilizes 
a 
comprehensive 
risk 
management 
strategy 
to 
monitor 
sensitivity 
of 
earnings 
to 
movements 
in 
interest 
rates. 
Specific 
types 
of 
funding 
and 
principal 
amounts 
hedged 
are 
determined 
based 
on 
prevailing 
market 
conditions 
and 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
yield 
curve. 
In 
conjunction 
with 
this 
strategy
, 
the 
Company
 
may 
employ 
various 
interest 
rate 
derivatives 
as 
risk 
management 
tools 
to 
hedge 
interest 
rate 
risk 
from 
recognized 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
or 
from 
forecasted 
transactions. 
The 
terms 
and 
notional 
amounts 
of 
derivatives 
are 
determined 
based 
on 
management™
s 
assessment 
of 
future 
interest 
rates, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
factors. 
Interest 
rate 
swaps 
have 
been 
designated 
as 
hedging 
the 
exposure 
to 
the 
benchmark 
interest 
rate 
risk 
associated 
with 
floating 
rate 
loans. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
 
and 
2013, 
the 
hedge 
maturities 
for 
hedges 
of 
floating 
rate 
loans 
ranged 
from 
less 
than 
one
 
year 
to 
four
 
years 
and 
from 
less 
than 
one
 
year 
to 
five
 
years, 
respectively
, 
with 
the 
weighted 
average 
being 
1.9

2.0

respectively
. 
Inef

on 
these

was 
immaterial 
for 
all 
years 
presented. 
At 
December€31, 
2014
, 
$203

are 
expected 
to 
be 
reclassified 
to

over 
the 
next 
twelve 
months 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
recognition 
of 
interest 
income 
on 
these 
hedged 
items. 
The 
amount 
to 
be 
reclassified 
into 
income 
includes 
both 
active 
and 
terminated 
or 
de-designated 
cash 
flow 
hedges. 
The 
Company
 
may 
choose 
to 
terminate 
or 
de-
designate 
a 
hedging 
relationship 
in 
this 
program 
due 
to 
a 
change 
in 
the 
risk 
management 
objective 
for 
that 
specific 
hedge 
item, 
which 
may 
arise 
in 
conjunction 
with 
an 
overall 
balance

management 
strategy
.
During 
2008, 
the 
Company 
executed 
zero-cost 
equity 
collars 
on 
60 
million
 
common 
shares 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Agreements
, 
which 
were 
to 
be 
derivatives 
in 
their 
entirety
. 
The 
Company 
designated 
the 
collars 
as 
cash 
flow 
hedges 
of 
the 
Company's 
probable 
forecasted 
sales 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
common 
shares. 
The 
risk 
management 
objective 
was 
to 
hedge 
the 
cash 
flows 
on 
the 
forecasted 
sales 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
common 
shares 
at 
market

above 
the 
call 
strike 
price 
and 
equal

below 
the 
put 
strike 
price. 
The 
Company 
assessed 
hedge 
ef
fectiveness 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis 
and 
measured 
hedge 
inef
fectiveness 
with 
the 
ef
fective 
portion 
of 
the 
changes 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
Agreements
 
recognized 
in 
AOCI 
and 
any 
inef

portions 
recognized 
in 
trading 
income.
During 
2012, 
the 
Company 
and 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
Counterparty 
accelerated 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
Agreements
, 
and 
the 
Company 
sold 
in 
the 
market 
or 
to 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
Counterparty 
59 
million
 
of 
its 
60 
million
 
shares 
of 
The 
Coca-
Cola 
Company 
and 
contributed 
the 
remaining 
1 
million
 
shares 
to 
the 
SunT
rust 
Foundation 
for 
a 
net 
gain 
of 
$1.9 
billion
, 
which 
is 
net 
of 
a 
$305 
million
 
loss 
related 
to 
the

of 
the

. 
Upon 
approval 
by 
the 
Board 
to 
terminate 
the 
Agreements
 
and 
sell 
and 
donate 
The 
Coca-Cola 
Company 
shares, 
the 
Agreements
 
no 
longer 
qualified 
as 
cash 
flow 
hedges. 
Thus, 
subsequent 
changes 
in 
value 
of 
the 
Agreements
, 
totaling 
$60 
million
, 
were 
recognized 
in 
net

Amounts 
recognized

of 
Shareholders' 
Equity 
during 
the 
period 
the 
Agreements
 
qualified 
as 
cash 
flow 
hedges 
totaled 
$365 
million
 
in 
losses. 
These 
amounts 
remained 
in 
AOCI 
until 
the 
sale 
of 
The 
Coca-Cola

shares, 
at 
which

Activities
In

to 
designated 
hedging 
relationships, 
the 
Company
 
also 
enters 
into 
derivatives 
as 
an 
end 
user 
to 
economically 
hedge 
risks 
associated

and 
derivative 
instruments, 
along 
with 
entering 
into 
derivatives 
in 
a 
trading 
capacity 
with 
its 
clients.
The 
primary 
risks 
that 
the 
Company
 
economically 
hedges 
are 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
foreign 
exchange 
risk, 
and

Fair 
value 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
price 
that 
would 
be 
received 
to 
sell 
an 
asset 
or 
paid 
to 
transfer 
a 
liability 
in 
an 
orderly 
transaction 
between 
market 
participants 
at 
the 
measurement 
date. 
The 
Company
™
s 
recurring 
fair 
value 
measurements 
are 
based 
on 
a 
requirement 
to 
measure 
such 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
fair 
value 
or 
the 
Company
™
s 
election 
to 
measure 
certain 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
fair 
value. 
Assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
are 
required 
to 
be 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
recurring 
basis 
include 
trading 
securities, 
securities 
AFS
, 
and 
derivative 
financial 
instruments. 
Assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
the 
Company
 
has 
elected 
to 
measure 
at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
recurring 
basis 
include 
MSR

and 
certain 
LHFS
, 
LHFI
, 
trading 
loans, 
brokered 
time 
deposits, 
and 
issuances 
of 
fixed 
rate 
debt.
The 
Company 
elects 
to 
measure 
certain 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
fair 
value 
to 
more 
accurately 
align 
its 
financial 
performance 
with 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
actively 
traded 
or 
hedged 
assets 
or 
liabilities. 
The 
use 
of 
fair 
value 
also 
enables 
the 
Company 
to 
mitigate 
non-economic 
earnings 
volatility 
caused 
from 
financial 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
being 
carried 
at 
dif
ferent 
bases 
of 
accounting, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
more 
accurately 
portray 
the 
active 
and 
dynamic 
management 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
balance 
sheet.
The 
Company
 
uses 
various 
valuation 
techniques 
and 
assumptions 
in 
estimating 
fair 
value. 
The 
assumptions 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
value 
of 
an 
instrument 
have 
varying 
degrees 
of 
impact 
to 
the 
overall 
fair 
value 
of 
an 
asset 
or 
liability
. 
This 
process 
involves 
the 
gathering 
of 
multiple 
sources 
of 
information, 
including 
broker 
quotes, 
values 
provided 
by 
pricing 
services, 
trading 
activity 
in 
other 
identical 
or 
similar 
securities, 
market 
indices, 
and 
pricing 
matrices. 
When 
observable 
market 
prices 
for 
the 
asset 
or 
liability 
are 
not 
available, 
the 
Company
 
employs 
various 
modeling 
techniques, 
such 
as 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
analyses 
to 
estimate 
fair 
value. 
Models 
used 
to 
produce 
material 
financial 
reporting 
information 
are 
validated 
prior 
to 
use, 
and 
following 
any 
material 
change 
in 
methodology
. 
Their 
performance 
is 
monitored 
quarterly
, 
and 
any 
material 
deterioration 
in 
model 
performance 
is 
addressed. 
This 
review 
is 
performed 
by 
an 
internal 
group 
that 
reports 
to 
the 
Corporate 
Risk 
Function.
The 
Company
 
has 
formal 
processes 
and 
controls 
in 
place 
to 
support 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
its 
fair 
value 
estimates. 
For 
fair 
values 
obtained 
from 
a 
third 
party 
or 
those 
that 
include 
certain 
trader 
estimates 
of 
fair 
value, 
there 
is 
an 
independent 
price 
validation 
function 
that 
provides 
oversight 
for 
these 
estimates. 
For 
level 
2 
instruments 
and 
certain 
level 
3 
instruments, 
the 
validation 
generally 
involves 
evaluating 
pricing 
received 
from 
two 
or 
more 
other 
third 
party 
pricing 
sources 
that 
are 
widely 
used 
by 
market 
participants. 
The 
Company
 
evaluates 
this 
pricing 
information 
from 
both 
a 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative 
perspective 
and 
determines 
whether 
any 
pricing 
dif
ferences 
exceed 
acceptable 
thresholds. 
If 
these 
thresholds 
are 
exceeded, 
then 
the 
Company
 
assesses 
dif
ferences 
in 
valuation 
approaches 
used, 
which 
may 
include 
contacting 
a 
pricing 
service 
to 
gain 
further 
insight 
into 
the 
valuation 
of 
a 
particular 
security 
or 
class 
of 
securities 
to 
resolve 
the 
pricing 
variance, 
which 
could 
include 
an 
adjustment 
to 
the 
price 
used 
for 
financial 
reporting 
purposes.
The 
Company
 
classifies 
instruments 
within 
level 
2 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
hierarchy 
when 
it 
determines 
that 
external 
pricing 
sources 
estimated 
fair 
value 
using 
prices 
for 
similar 
instruments 
trading 
in 
active 
markets. 
A
 
wide 
range 
of 
quoted 
values 
from 
pricing 
sources 
may 
imply 
a 
reduced 
level 
of 
market 
activity 
and 
indicate 
that 
significant 
adjustments 
to 
price 
indications 
have 
been 
made. 
In 
such 
cases, 
the 
Company 
evaluates 
whether 
the 
asset 
or 
liability 
should 
be 
classified 
as 
level 
3.
Determining 
whether 
to 
classify 
an 
instrument 
as 
level 
3 
involves 
judgment 
and 
is 
based 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
subjective 
factors 
including 
whether 
a 
market 
is 
inactive. 
A
 
market 
is 
considered 
inactive 
if 
significant 
decreases 
in 
the 
volume 
and 
level 
of 
activity 
for 
the 
asset 
or 
liability 
have 
been 
observed. 
In 
making 
this 
determination 
the 
Company
 
evaluates 
the 
number 
of 
recent 
transactions 
in 
either 
the 
primary 
or 
secondary 
market, 
whether 
price 
quotations 
are 
current, 
the 
nature 
of 
market 
participants, 
the 
variability 
of 
price 
quotations, 
the 
breadth 
of 
bid/ask 
spreads, 
declines 
in 
(or 
the 
absence 
of) 
new 
issuances, 
and 
the 
availability 
of 
public 
information. 
When 
a 
market 
is 
determined 
to 
be 
inactive, 
significant 
adjustments 
may 
be 
made 
to 
price 
indications 
when 
estimating 
fair 
value. 
In 
making 
these 
adjustments 
the 
Company 
seeks 
to 
employ 
assumptions 
a 
market 
participant 
would 
use 
to 
value 
the 
asset 
or 
liability
, 
including 
consideration 
of 
illiquidity 
in 
the 
referenced 
market.

As

began 
failing 
in 
February 
2008 
and 
have 
been 
considered

securities 
due 
to 
the 
significant 
decrease 
in 
the 
volume 
and 
level 
of

in 
these 
markets, 
which 
has 
necessitated 
the 
use

The

also 
evaluated 
the 
relative 
strength 
of

and 
made 
appropriate 
downward 
adjustments 
in

based

the

the

continued

Company-sponsored 
securitizations 
of 
trust 
preferred 
collateral. 
The 
auctions 
related 
to 
these 
securities 
were 
failing, 
requiring 
the 
Company 
to 
make 
significant 
adjustments 
to 
valuation 
assumptions. 
As 
such, 
the

classified 
these

Under

No

AFS
 
include 
FHLB
 
of 
Atlanta

and 
Federal

which 
are

As 
such, 
observable

The 
Company
 
accounts 
for 
the

based 
on 
industry 
guidance 
that 
requires 
these

be 
carried 
at

and 
evaluated 
for

based 
on 
the 
ultimate 
recovery 
of

Derivative 
contracts
The 
Company
 
holds 
derivative 
instruments 
for 
both 
trading 
purposes 
and 
risk 
management 
purposes. 
Level 
1 
derivative 
contracts 
generally 
include 
exchange-
traded 
futures 
or 
option 
contracts 
for 
which 
pricing 
is 
readily 
available. 
The 
Company
™
s 
level 
2 
instruments 
are 
predominantly 
standard 
OTC
 
swaps, 
options, 
and 
forwards, 
measured 
using 
observable 
market 
assumptions 
for 
interest 
rates, 
foreign 
exchange, 
equity
, 
and 
credit. 
Because 
fair 
values 
for 
OTC
 
contracts 
are 
not 
readily 
available, 
the 
Company
 
estimates 
fair 
values 
using 
internal, 
but 
standard, 
valuation 
models. 
The 
selection 
of 
valuation 
models 
is 
driven 
by 
the 
type 
of 
contract: 
for 
option-based 
products, 
the 
Company
 
uses 
an 
appropriate 
option 
pricing 
model 
such 
as 
Black-Scholes. 
For 
forward-based 
products, 
the 
Company
™
s 
valuation 
methodology 
is 
generally 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
approach.
Level 
2 
derivative 
instruments 
are 
primarily 
transacted 
in 
the 
institutional 
dealer 
market 
and 
priced 
with 
observable 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued
146
market 
assumptions 
at 
a 
mid-market 
valuation 
point, 
with 
appropriate 
valuation 
adjustments 
for 
liquidity 
and 
credit 
risk. 
T
o 
this 
end, 
the 
Company
 
has 
evaluated 
liquidity 
premiums 
required 
by 
market 
participants, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
credit 
risk 
of 
its 
counterparties 
and 
its 
own 
credit. 
The 
Company
 
has 
considered 
factors 
such 
as 
the 
likelihood 
of 
default 
by 
itself 
and 
its 
counterparties, 
its 
net 
exposures, 
and 
remaining 
maturities 
in 
determining 
the 
appropriate 
fair 
value 
adjustments 
to

on 
the

's 
derivative 
contracts.
The 
Company
's 
level 
3 
derivatives 
include 
IRLC
s 
that 
satisfy 
the 
criteria 
to 
be 
treated 
as 
derivative 
financial 
instruments. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
IRLC
s 
on 
residential 
LHFS
, 
while 
based 
on 
interest 
rates 
observable 
in 
the 
market, 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
ultimate 
closing 
of 
the 
loans. 
These 
ﬁpull-
throughﬂ 
rates 
are 
based 
on 
the 
Company
™
s 
historical 
data 
and 
reflect 
the 
Company
™
s 
best 
estimate 
of 
the 
likelihood 
that 
a 
commitment 
will 
ultimately 
result 
in 
a 
closed 
loan. 
As 
pull-
through 
rates 
increase, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
IRLC
s 
also 
increases. 
Servicing 
value 
is 
included 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
IRLC
s, 
and 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
servicing 
is 
determined 
by 
projecting 
cash 
flows, 
which 
are 
then 
discounted 
to 
estimate 
an 
expected 
fair 
value. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
servicing 
is 
impacted 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
prepayment 
assumptions, 
discount 
rates, 
delinquency 
rates, 
contractually 
specified 
servicing 
fees, 
servicing 
costs, 
and 
underlying 
portfolio 
characteristics. 
Because 
these 
inputs 
are 
not 
transparent 
in 
market 
trades, 
IRLC
s 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
level 
3 
assets. 
During 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
the 
Company
 
transferred 
$245 
million
 
and 
$222

,

T
rading

The

engages 
in 
certain 
businesses 
whereby 
the 
election 
to 
measure 
loans 
at 
fair 
value 
for 
financial 
reporting 
aligns 
with 
the 
underlying 
business 
purpose. 
Specifically
, 
the 
loans 
that 
are 
included 
within 
this 
classification 
are: 
(i)€loans 
made 
or 
acquired 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Company

s 
TRS
 
business, 
(ii)€loans

Entities," 
and 
Note

, 
ﬁDerivative 
Financial 
Instruments,ﬂ 
for 
further 
discussion 
of 
this 
business. 
All 
of 
these 
loans 
are 
classified 
as 
level 
2, 
due 
to 
the 
market 
data 
that 
the 
Company
 
uses 
in 
the 
estimate 
of 
fair 
value.
The 
loans 
made 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Company
™
s 
TRS
 
business 
are 
short-term, 
demand 
loans, 
whereby 
the 
repayment 
is 
senior 
in 
priority 
and 
whose 
value 
is 
collateralized. 
While 
these 
loans 
do 
not 
trade 
in 
the 
market, 
the 
Company
 
believes 
that 
the 
par 
amount 
of 
the 
loans 
approximates 
fair 
value 
and 
no 
unobservable 
assumptions 
are 
used 
by 
the 
Company
 
to 
value 
these 
loans. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
the 
Company
 
had 
outstanding 
$2.3 
billion
 
and 
$1.5 
billion
, 
respectively
, 
of 
such 
short-term 
loans 
carried 
at 
fair 
value.
SBA
 
loans 
are 
similar 
to 
SBA
 
securities 
discussed 
herein 
under 
ﬁFederal 
agency 
securities,ﬂ 
except 
for 
their 
legal 
form. 
In 
both 
cases, 
the 
Company
 
trades 
instruments 
that 
are 
fully 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
U.S.
 
government 
as 
to 
contractual 
principal 
and 
interest 
and 
there 
is 
suf
ficient 
observable 
trading 
activity 
upon 
which 
to 
base 
the 
estimate 
of 
fair 
value. 
As 
these 
SBA
 
loans 
are 
fully 
guaranteed, 
the 
changes 
in 
fair 
value 
are 
attributable 
to 
factors 
other 
than 
instrument-specific 
credit 
risk.
The 
loans 
from 
the 
Company
™
s 
sales 
and 
trading 
business 
are 
commercial 
and 
corporate 
leveraged 
loans 
that 
are 
either 
traded 
in 
the 
market 
or 
for 
which 
similar 
loans 
trade. 
The 
Company
 
elected 
to 
measure 
these 
loans 
at 
fair 
value 
since 
they 
are 
actively 
traded. 
For 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014, 
2013, 
and 
2012
, 
the 
Company
 
recognized 
an 
immaterial 
amount 
of 
gains 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
fair 
value 
attributable 
to 
instrument-specific 
credit 
risk. 
The 
Company
 
is 
able 
to 
obtain 
fair 
value 
estimates 
for 
substantially 
all 
of 
these 
loans 
through 
a 
third 
party 
valuation 
service 
that 
is 
broadly 
used 
by 
market 
participants. 
While 
most 
of 
the 
loans 
are 
traded 
in 
the 
market, 
the 
Company
 
does 
not 
believe 
that 
trading 
activity 
qualifies 
the 
loans 
as 
level 
1 
instruments, 
as 
the 
volume 
and 
level 
of 
trading 
activity 
is 
subject 
to 
variability 
and 
the 
loans 
are 
not 
exchange-traded. 
The 
Company
 
believes 
that 
level 
2 
is 
a 
more 
appropriate 
presentation 
of 
the 
underlying 
market 
activity 
for 
the 
loans. 
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
$284

and 
$313 
million
,

values 
certain 
newly-originated

LHFS
 
predominantly 
at 
fair

based 
upon 
defined 
product 
criteria. 
The 
Company
 
chooses 
to 
fair 
value 
these 
mortgage 
LHFS
 
to 
eliminate 
the 
complexities 
and 
inherent 
dif

of

fees 
and

value 
is 
included 
in 
the

and 
initially 
recognized 
at 
the 
time 
the

of 
the

The 
mark-to-market

the 
associated 
economic

are 
captured 
in

For 
residential

that 
the 
Company
 
has 
elected 
to 
measure 
at 
fair

the 
Company
 
considers 
the 
component 
of 
the 
fair

changes 
due 
to 
instrument-specific 
credit 
risk, 
which 
is 
intended 
to 
be 
an 
approximation 
of 
the

change 
attributable 
to

ﬁCertain

the

was 
previously 
the

of 
a 
CLO
 
entity
, 
which 
resulted 
in 
the 
Company
 
consolidating 
the

During

of 
2014, 
in 
connection 
with

determined 
it

no 
longer 
the 
primary

, 
and 
accordingly
, 
the 
CLO
 
was 
deconsolidated. 
Prior 
to 
the 
second

the 
Company
 
elected 
to 
measure 
the

at 
fair

because 
the

LHFI
Level 
3 
LHFI
 
predominantly 
includes 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 
deemed 
not 
marketable, 
lar
gely 
due 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
loan 
defects. 
The 
Company
 
chooses 
to 
fair 
value 
these 
mortgage 
LHFI 
to 
eliminate 
the 
complexities 
and 
inherent 
dif
ficulties 
of 
achieving 
hedge 
accounting 
and 
to 
better 
align 
reported 
results 
with 
the 
underlying 
economic 
changes 
in 
value 
of 
the 
loans 
and 
related 
hedge 
instruments. 
The 
Company
 
values 
these 
loans 
using 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
approach 
based 
on 
assumptions 
that 
are 
generally 
not 
observable 
in 
current 
markets, 
such 
as 
prepayment 
speeds, 
default 
rates, 
loss 
severity 
rates, 
and 
discount 
rates. 
These 
assumptions 
have 
an 
inverse 
relationship 
to 
the 
overall 
fair 
value. 
Level 
3 
LHFI
 
also 
includes 
mortgage 
loans 
that 
are 
valued 
using 
collateral 
based 
pricing. 
Changes 
in 
the 
applicable 
housing 
price 
index 
since 
the 
time 
of 
the 
loan 
origination 
are 
considered 
and 
applied 
to 
the 
loan's 
collateral 
value. 
An 
additional 
discount 
representing 
the 
return 
that 
a 
buyer 
would 
require 
is 
also 
considered 
in 
the 
overall 
fair 
value.
Mortgage 
Servicing 
Rights
The 
Company
 
records 
MSR
 
assets 
at 
fair 
value. 
These 
values 
are 
determined 
by 
projecting 
cash 
flows, 
which 
are 
then 
discounted. 
The 
fair 
values 
of 
MSR
s 
are 
impacted 
by 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
prepayment 
assumptions, 
spreads, 
delinquency 
rates, 
contractually 
specified 
servicing 
fees, 
servicing 
costs, 
and 
underlying 
portfolio 
characteristics. 
For 
additional 
information, 
see 
Note 
9
, 
"Goodwill 
and 
Other 
Intangible 
Assets." 
The 
underlying 
assumptions 
and 
estimated 
values 
are 
corroborated 
by 
values 
received 
from 
independent 
third 
parties 
based 
on 
their 
review 
of 
the 
servicing 
portfolio, 
and 
comparisons 
to 
market 
transactions. 
Because 
these 
inputs 
are 
not 
transparent 
in 
market 
trades, 
MSR
s 
are 
classified 
as 
level 
3 
assets.

T

in 
connection 
with 
its 
sale 
of 
V
isa
 
Class 
B

, 
the 
Company
 
entered 
into 
a

contract 
whereby 
the 
ultimate 
cash 
payments 
received 
or 
paid, 
if 
any
, 
under 
the

are 
based 
on 
the 
ultimate 
resolution 
of 
litigation 
involving 
V

. 
The 
value 
of 
the

was 
estimated 
based 
on 
the 
Company

s 
expectations 
regarding 
the 
ultimate 
resolution 
of 
that

which 
involved 
a 
high

Accordingly
, 
the

The 
Company
 
elected 
to 
measure 
certain 
CD
s 
at 
fair 
value. 
These 
debt 
instruments 
included 
embedded 
derivatives 
that 
were 
generally 
based 
on 
underlying 
equity 
securities 
or 
equity 
indices, 
but 
may 
have 
been 
based 
on 
other 
underlyings 
that 
may 
or 
may 
not 
have 
been 
clearly 
and 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
host 
debt 
instrument. 
The 
Company
 
measured 
certain 
of 
these 
instruments 
at 
fair 
value 
to 
better 
align 
the 
economics 
of 
the 
CD
s 
with 
the 
Company
™
s 
risk 
management 
strategies. 
The 
Company
 
evaluated, 
on 
an 
instrument 
specific 
basis, 
whether 
a 
new 
issuance 
should 
be 
measured 
at 
fair 
value.
The 
Company
 
classified 
these 
CD
s 
as 
level 
2 
instruments 
due 
to 
the 
Company
™
s 
ability 
to 
reasonably 
measure 
all 
significant 
inputs 
based 
on 
observable 
market 
variables. 
The 
Company
 
employed 
a 
discounted 
cash

approach 
to 
the

component 
of 
the 
CD
, 
based 
on 
observable

of 
the 
CD
, 
and 
an 
estimate 
of 
the 
Bank
™
s

risk. 
For 
the 
embedded 
derivative 
features, 
the 
Company
 
used 
the

valuation 
methodologies 
as 
if 
the

as

Long-term 
debt
The 
Company
 
has 
elected 
to 
measure 
at 
fair 
value 
certain 
fixed 
rate 
debt 
issuances 
of 
public 
debt 
which 
are 
valued 
by 
obtaining 
quotes 
from 
a 
third 
party 
pricing 
service 
and 
utilizing 
broker 
quotes 
to 
corroborate 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
those 
marks. 
Additionally
, 
information 
from 
market 
data 
of 
recent 
observable 
trades 
and 
indications 
from 
buy 
side 
investors, 
if 
available, 
are 
taken 
into 
consideration 
as 
additional 
support 
for 
the 
value. 
Due 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
this 
information, 
the 
Company
 
determined 
that 
the 
appropriate 
classification 
for 
the 
debt 
is 
level 
2. 
The 
election 
to 
fair 
value 
the 
debt 
was 
made 
to 
align 
the 
accounting 
for 
the 
debt 
with 
the 
accounting 
for 
the 
derivatives 
without 
having 
to 
account 
for 
the 
debt 
under 
hedge 
accounting, 
thus 
avoiding 
the 
complex 
and 
time 
consuming 
fair 
value 
hedge 
accounting 
requirements.
The 
Company
™
s 
public 
debt 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
impacts 
earnings 
predominantly 
through 
changes 
in 
the 
Company
™
s 
credit 
spreads 
as 
the 
Company
 
has 
entered 
into 
derivative 
financial 
instruments 
that 
economically 
convert 
the 
interest 
rate 
on 
the 
debt 
from 
a 
fixed 
to 
a 
floating 
rate. 
The 
estimated 
earnings 
impact 
from 
changes 
in 
credit 
spreads 
above 
U.S. 
T
reasury
 
rates 
were 
losses 
of 
$19 
million
 
and 
gains 
of 
$40

and 
$78

for 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014, 
2013, 
and 
2012
, 
respectively
.
At 
December 
31, 
2014
, 
the 
Company
 
did 
not
 
measure 
any 
issued 
securities 
of 
a 
CLO
 
at 
fair 
value. 
Previously
, 
the 
Company
 
classified 
these 
types 
of 
securities 
as 
level 
2, 
as 
the 
primary 
driver 
of 
their 
fair 
values 
were 
the 
loans 
owned 
by 
the 
CLO
, 
which 
the 
Company
 
also 
elected 
to 
measure 
at 
fair 
value 
prior 
to 
the 
deconsolidation 
of 
the 
CLO, 
as 
discussed 
herein 
under 
ﬁLoans

The 
Company

s 
other

that 
are 
carried 
at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
recurring 
basis 
include 
contingent 
consideration 
obligations 
related 
to 
acquisitions. 
Contingent 
consideration 
associated 
with 
acquisitions 
is 
adjusted 
to 
fair 
value 
until 
settled.€
As 
the 
assumptions 
used 
to 
measure 
fair 
value 
are 
based 
on 
internal 
metrics 
that 
are 
not 
market 
observable, 
the 
earn-out 
is 
considered 
a 
level

.

The 
following 
is 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
valuation 
techniques 
and 
inputs 
used 
in 
developing 
fair 
value 
measurements 
for 
assets 
classified 
as 
level 
2 
or 
3 
that 
are 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
on 
a 
non-
recurring 
basis, 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
nature 
and 
risks 
of 
the 
instrument
.
Loans 
Held 
for
 
Sale
At 
December 
31, 
2014, 
LHFS
 
level 
1 
assets 
consisted 
of 
commercial 
and 
industrial 
loans. 
At 
 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
 
level 
2 
assets 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
agency 
and 
non-
agency 
residential 
mortgages, 
which 
were 
measured 
using 
observable 
collateral 
valuations, 
and 
corporate 
loans 
that 
are 
accounted 
for 
at 
LOCOM
. 
Level 
3 
assets 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
indirect 
auto 
loans 
and 
tax-exempt 
municipal 
leases. 
These 
loans 
were 
valued 
consistent 
with 
the 
methodology 
discussed 
in 
the 
Recurring 
Fair 
V
alue 
Measurement 
section 
of 
this 
footnote.
During 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
the 
Company
 
transferred 
$470 
million
 
of 
C&I 
loans 
to 
LHFS 
as 
the 
Company
 
elected 
to 
actively 
market 
these 
loans 
for 
sale, 
and 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
sold 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2015; 
$340 
million
 
of 
these 
were 
tax-
exempt 
municipal 
leases 
included 
in 
level 
3 
and 
the 
remainder 
were 
included 
in 
level 
1 
at 
December 
31, 
2014. 
Also, 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
the 
Company
 
transferred 
$38 
million
 
of 
residential 
mortgage 
NPL
s 
to 
LHFS
, 
which 
are 
included 
in 
level 
2 
at 
December 
31, 
2014, 
as 
the 
Company
 
elected 
to 
actively 
market 
these 
loans 
for 
sale. 
These 
transferred 
loans 
were 
predominantly 
reported 
at 
amortized 
cost 
prior 
to 
transferring 
to 
LHFS
; 
however
, 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
NPL
s 
were 
carried 
at 
fair 
value. 
Additionally
, 
during 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2014, 
the 
Company 
transferred 
approximately 
$600 
million
 
of 
indirect 
auto 
loans 
to 
LHFS
, 
which 
the 
Company 
elected 
to 
actively 
market 
for 
sale 
in 
anticipation 
of 
a 
first 
quarter 
2015 
sale. 
These 
loans 
are 
included 
in 
level 
3 
at 
December 
31, 
2014.
During 
2013, 
the 
Company 
transferred 
$25 
million
 
of 
residential 
mortgage 
NPLs 
to 
LHFS, 
as 
the 
Company 
elected 
to 
actively 
market 
these 
loans 
for 
sale. 
These 
loans 
were 
predominantly 
reported 
at 
amortized 
cost 
prior 
to 
transferring 
to 
LHFS; 
however
, 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
NPLs 
was 
carried 
at 
fair 
value. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
transferring 
the 
loans 
to 
LHFS, 
the 
Company 
recognized 
a 
$3 
million
 
char
ge-of
f 
to 
reflect 
the 
loans' 
estimated 
market 
value. 
These 
transferred 
NPL
 
loans 
were 
sold 
at 
approximately 
their 
carrying 
value 
during 
2013. 
The 
Company
 
also 
sold 
an 
additional 
$63 
million
 
of 
residential 
mortgage 
NPL
s 
which 
had 
either 
been 
transferred 
to 
LHFS
 
in 
a 
prior 
period 
or 
repurchased 
into 
LHFS
 
directly
. 
These 
additional 
loans 
were 
sold 
at 
a 
gain 
of 
approximately 
$12 
million
 
during 
2013.
Loans 
Held 
for
 
Investment
At 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
LHFI
 
consisted 
primarily 
of 
consumer 
and 
residential 
real 
estate 
loans 
dischar
ged 
in 
Chapter 
7 
bankruptcy 
that 
had 
not 
been 
reaf
firmed 
by 
the 
borrower
, 
as 
well 
as 
nonperforming 
CRE 
loans 
for 
which 
specific 
reserves 
had 
been 
recognized. 
As 
these 
loans 
have 
been 
classified 
as 
nonperforming, 
cash 
proceeds 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
the 
underlying 
collateral 
is 
the 
expected 
source 
of 
repayment 
for 
a 
majority 
of 
these 
loans. 
Accordingly
, 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
these 
loans 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
underlying 
collateral, 
incorporating 
market 
data 
if 
available. 
There 
were 
no 
gains 
or 
losses 
during 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
 
as 
the 
char
ge-of
fs 
related 
to 
these 
loans 
are 
a 
component 
of 
the 
ALLL
. 
Due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
market 
data 
for 
similar 
assets, 
all 
of 
these 
loans 
are 
considered 
level 
3.

is

are 
based 
on

Affordable 
Housing
The 
Company
 
evaluates 
its 
consolidated 
af
fordable 
housing 
properties 
for 
impairment 
whenever 
events 
or 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
indicate 
that 
the 
carrying 
amount 
may 
not 
be 
recoverable. 
Impairment 
is 
recognized 
if 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
the 
property 
exceeds 
its 
fair 
value. 
During 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2014
, 
the 
Company
 
decided 
to 
actively 
market 
for 
sale 
certain 
consolidated 
af
fordable 
housing 
properties, 
and 
accordingly
, 
recognized 
an 
impairment 
char
ge 
of 
$36 
million
 
to 
adjust 
the 
carrying 
values 
of 
these 
properties 
to 
their 
estimated 
net 
realizable 
values 
obtained 
from 
a 
third 
party 
broker 
opinion 
and 
were 
considered 
level 
3. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014
, 
the 
Company 
recognized 
gains 
of 
$15 
million
 
on 
these 
af
fordable 
housing 
properties 
as 
a 
result 
of 
increased 
estimated 
net 
realizable 
values. 
The 
Company 
anticipates 
that 
the 
sale 
of 
a 
majority 
of 
these 
properties 
will 
occur 
within 
the 
next 
three 
months.
At 
December 
31, 
2013, 
fair 
value 
measurements 
for 
af
fordable 
housing 
properties 
were 
derived 
from 
internal 
analyses 
using 
market 
assumptions. 
Significant 
assumptions 
utilized 
in 
these 
analyses 
included 
cash 
flows, 
market 
capitalization 
rates, 
and 
tax 
credit 
market 
pricing. 
Due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
comparable 
sales 
in 
the 
marketplace, 
these 
valuations 
were 
considered 
level 
3. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2013
, 
the 
Company 
recognized 
impairment 
of 
$3 
million
 
on 
its 
held 
for 
use 
consolidated 
af
fordable 
housing 
properties.
Other
 
Assets
Other 
assets 
consist 
of 
other 
repossessed 
assets, 
assets 
under 
operating 
leases 
where 
the 
Company
 
is 
the 
lessor
, 
land 
held 
for 
sale, 
and 
equity 
method 
investments.
Other 
repossessed 
assets 
consist 
of 
repossessed 
personal 
property 
that 
is 
measured 
at 
fair 
value 
less 
cost 
to 
sell. 
These 
assets 
are 
considered 
level 
3 
as 
their 
fair 
value 
is 
determined 
based 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
subjective 
unobservable 
factors. 
During 
the 
years 
ended 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
no 
losses 
were 
recognized 
by 
the 
Company
 
on 
other 
repossessed 
assets 
as 
the 
impairment 
char
ges 
on 
repossessed 
personal 
property 
are 
a 
component 
of 
the 
ALLL
.
The 
Company
 
monitors 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
assets 
under 
operating 
leases 
where 
the 
Company
 
is 
the 
lessor 
and 
recognizes 
impairment 
to 
the 
extent 
the 
carrying 
value 
is 
not 
recoverable 
and 
the 
fair 
value 
is 
less 
than 
its 
carrying 
value. 
Fair 
value 
is 
determined 
using 
collateral 
specific 
pricing 
digests, 
external 
appraisals,

The 
following 
methods 
and 
assumptions 
were 
used 
by 
the 
Company
 
in 
estimating 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
financial 
instruments:
(a) 
Cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
are 
valued 
at 
their 
carrying 
amounts 
reported 
in 
the 
balance 
sheet, 
which 
are 
reasonable 
estimates 
of 
fair 
value 
due 
to 
the 
relatively 
short 
period 
to 
maturity 
of 
the 
instruments.
(b) 
T
rading 
assets 
and 
derivatives, 
securities 
AFS
, 
and 
trading 
liabilities 
and 
derivatives 
that 
are 
classified 
as 
level 
1 
are 
valued 
based 
on 
quoted 
market 
prices. 
For 
those 
instruments 
classified 
as 
level 
2 
or 
3, 
refer 
to 
the 
respective 
valuation 
discussions 
within 
this 
footnote.
(c) 
LHFS
 
are 
generally 
valued 
based 
on 
observable 
current 
market 
prices 
or
, 
if 
quoted 
market 
prices 
are 
not 
available, 
on 
quoted 
market 
prices 
of 
similar 
instruments. 
Refer 
to 
the 
LHFS
 
section 
within 
this 
footnote 
for 
further 
discussion 
of 
the 
LHFS
 
carried 
at 
fair 
value. 
In 
instances 
for 
which 
significant 
valuation 
assumptions 
are 
not 
readily 
observable 
in 
the 
market, 
instruments 
are 
valued 
based 
on 
the 
best 
available 
data 
to 
approximate 
fair 
value. 
This 
data 
may 
be 
internally-developed 
and 
considers 
risk 
premiums 
that 
a 
market 
participant 
would 
require 
under 
then-current 
market 
conditions.
(d) 
LHFI
 
fair 
values 
are 
based 
on 
a 
hypothetical 
exit 
price, 
which 
does 
not 
represent 
the 
estimated 
intrinsic 
value 
of 
the 
loan 
if 
held 
for 
investment. 
The 
assumptions 
used 
are 
expected 
to 
approximate 
those 
that 
a 
market 
participant 
purchasing 
the 
loans 
would 
use 
to 
value 
the 
loans, 
including 
a 
market 
risk 
premium 
and 
liquidity 
discount. 
Estimating 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
when 
loan 
sales 
and 
trading 
markets 
are 
illiquid, 
or 
for 
certain 
loan 
types, 
nonexistent, 
requires 
significant 
judgment. 
Therefore,

estimated 
fair 
value 
can 
vary 
significantly 
depending 
on 
a 
market 
participant™
s 
ultimate 
considerations 
and 
assumptions. 
The 
final 
value 
yields 
a 
market 
participant™
s 
expected 
return 
on 
investment 
that 
is 
indicative 
of 
the 
current 
market 
conditions, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
Company
™
s 
estimated 
value 
from 
continuing 
to 
hold 
these 
loans 
or 
its 
lack 
of 
willingness 
to 
transact 
at 
these 
estimated 
values.
 
The 
Company
 
generally 
estimated 
fair 
value 
for 
LHFI
 
based 
on 
estimated 
future 
cash 
flows 
discounted, 
initially
, 
at 
current 
origination 
rates 
for 
loans 
with 
similar 
terms 
and 
credit

which 
derived 
an 
estimated 
value 
of 
100%
 
and 
99%
 
on 
the 
loan 
portfolio™
s 
net 
carrying 
value 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
, 
respectively
. 
The 
value 
derived 
from 
origination 
rates 
likely 
does 
not 
represent 
an 
exit 
price; 
therefore, 
an 
incremental 
market 
risk 
and 
liquidity 
discount 
was 
subtracted 
from 
the 
initial 
value 
at 
December 
31, 
2014 
and 
2013
. 
The 
discounted 
value 
is 
a 
function 
of 
a 
market 
participant™
s 
required 
yield 
in 
the 
current 
environment 
and 
is 
not 
a 
reflection 
of 
the 
expected 
cumulative 
losses 
on 
the 
loans. 
Loan 
prepayments 
are 
used 
to 
adjust 
future 
cash 
flows 
based 
on 
historical 
experience 
and 
prepayment 
model 
forecasts. 
The 
value 
of 
related 
accrued 
interest 
on 
loans 
approximates 
fair 
value; 
however
, 
it 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
carrying 
amount 
or 
fair 
value 
of 
loans. 
The 
value 
of 
long-term 
customer 
relationships 
is 
not 
permitted 
under

to 
be 
included 
in

such 
as 
DDA

at 
the

The

Œ 
CONTINGENCIES
Litigation 
and 
Regulatory 
Matters
In 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
business, 
the 
Company
 
and 
its 
subsidiaries 
are 
parties 
to 
numerous 
civil 
claims 
and 
lawsuits 
and 
subject 
to 
regulatory 
examinations, 
investigations, 
and 
requests 
for 
information. 
Some 
of 
these 
matters 
involve 
claims 
for 
substantial 
amounts. 
The 
Company
™
s 
experience 
has 
shown 
that 
the 
damages 
alleged 
by 
plaintif
fs 
or 
claimants 
are 
often 
overstated, 
based 
on 
unsubstantiated 
legal 
theories, 
unsupported 
by 
facts, 
and/or 
bear 
no 
relation 
to 
the 
ultimate 
award 
that 
a 
court 
might 
grant. 
Additionally
, 
the 
outcome 
of 
litigation 
and 
regulatory 
matters 
and 
the 
timing 
of 
ultimate 
resolution 
are 
inherently 
dif
ficult 
to 
predict. 
These 
factors 
make 
it 
dif
ficult 
for 
the 
Company
 
to 
provide 
a 
meaningful 
estimate 
of 
the 
range 
of 
reasonably 
possible 
outcomes 
of 
claims 
in 
the 
aggregate 
or 
by 
individual 
claim. 
However
, 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis, 
reserves 
are 
established 
for 
those 
legal 
claims 
in 
which 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
a 
loss 
will 
be 
incurred 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
such 
loss 
can 
be 
reasonably 
estimated. 
The 
actual 
costs 
of 
resolving 
these 
claims 
may 
be 
substantially 
higher 
or 
lower 
than 
the 
amounts 
reserved.
For 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
legal 
matters 
in 
which 
the 
Company
 
is 
involved, 
the 
Company
 
is 
able 
to 
estimate 
a 
range 
of 
reasonably 
possible 
losses. 
For 
other 
matters 
for 
which 
a 
loss 
is 
probable 
or 
reasonably 
possible, 
such 
an 
estimate 
is 
not 
possible. 
For 
those 
matters 
where 
a 
loss 
is 
reasonably 
possible, 
management 
currently 
estimates 
the 
aggregate 
range 
of 
reasonably 
possible 
losses 
as 
$0
 
to 
approximately 
$180 
million
 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
reserves, 
if 
any
, 
related 
to 
those 
matters. 
This 
estimated 
range 
of 
reasonably 
possible 
losses 
represents 
the 
estimated 
possible 
losses 
over 
the 
life 
of 
such 
legal 
matters, 
which 
may 
span 
a 
currently 
indeterminable 
number 
of 
years, 
and 
is 
based 
on 
information 
available 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
matters 
underlying 
the 
estimated 
range 
will 
change 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
and 
actual 
results 
may 
vary 
significantly 
from 
this 
estimate. 
Those 
matters 
for 
which 
an 
estimate 
is 
not 
possible 
are 
not 
included 
within 
this 
estimated 
range; 
therefore, 
this 
estimated 
range 
does 
not 
represent 
the 
Company

maximum 
loss 
exposure. 
Based 
on 
current

it 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
management 
that

entered 
an

holding 
that

explicitly 
stated

question 
of 
whether 
the

SunT

UGRIC 
counterclaimed 
for 
declaratory

interpretation 
of 
whether

obligated 
to 
continue

On 
UGRIC's 
counterclaim, 
the

granted 
judgment

held 
that

not 
entitled

this 
finding. 
The

Evaluation 
of 
Disclosure 
Controls 
and 
Procedures
The 
Company
 
conducted 
an 
evaluation, 
under 
the 
supervision 
and 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
its 
CEO
 
and 
CFO
, 
of 
the 
ef
fectiveness 
of 
the 
design 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
Company
™
s 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
(as 
defined 
in 
Rule 
13a-15
(e) 
of 
the 
Exchange 
Act
) 
at 
December€31, 
2014
. 
The 
Company
™
s 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
are 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
information 
required 
to 
be 
disclosed 
by 
the 
Company
 
in 
the 
reports 
that 
it 
files 
or 
submits 
under 
the 
Exchange 
Act
 
is 
recorded, 
processed, 
summarized, 
and 
reported 
within 
the 
time 
periods 
specified 
in 
the 
rules 
and 
forms 
of 
the 
SEC
, 
and 
that 
such 
information 
is 
accumulated 
and 
communicated 
to 
the 
Company
™
s 
management, 
including 
its 
CEO
 
and 
CFO
, 
as 
appropriate, 
to 
allow 
timely 
decisions 
regarding 
required 
disclosure. 
Based 
upon 
the 
evaluation, 
the 
CEO
 
and 
CFO
 
concluded 
that 
the

controls

ef
fective

Management™
s 
Report 
on 
Internal 
Control 
over 
Financial 
Reporting
Management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
adequate 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
(as 
defined 
in 
Rule 
13a-15(f) 
of 
the 
Exchange 
Act) 
for 
the 
Company
. 
The 
Company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
CEO 
and 
CFO 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
financial 
statements 
for 
external 
purposes 
in 
accordance 
with 
U.S. 
GAAP
.
Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
misstatements. 
Also, 
projections 
of 
any 
evaluation 
of 
ef
fectiveness 
to 
future 
periods 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
risk 
that 
controls 
may 
become 
inadequate 
because 
of 
changes 
in 
conditions 
or 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
policies 
or 
procedures 
may 
deteriorate.
Management 
has 
made 
a 
comprehensive 
review
, 
evaluation, 
and 
assessment 
of 
the 
Company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
at 
December€31, 
2014. 
In 
making 
its 
assessment 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
management 
utilized 
the 
updated 
framework 
issued 
in 
2013 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
Sponsoring 
Or
ganizations 
of 
the 
T
readway 
Commission 
("COSO") 
in 
Internal 
Contr
ol-Integrated 
Framework.
 
Based 
on 
that 
assessment, 
management 
concluded 
that, 
at 
December€31, 
2014, 
the 
Company™
s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
ef
fective.
