Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, ﬁWecontinue to generate strong growth in pre-provision net revenue,reflecting operating leverage improvement resulting from solidloan growth, a more profitable earning assets mix and controlledcore operating expenses. We are on track to achieve the goalswe established in mid-2015, leading to an efficiency ratio of 66%or better in 2016 and in the low 60% range in 2017 whileaccelerating revenue growth. Although energy-related creditlosses and related provisions largely offset these gains, recentimprovements in energy prices are encouraging, and creditperformance in the rest of the portfolio has been stellar. We™repleased with the progress made during the quarter in building astronger foundation for future growth and capital distributions.ﬂOPERATING PERFORMANCE2ZIONS BANCORPORATIONPress Release Œ Page 2April 25, 2016- more -The dollar change and percent change amounts presented in the following tables are calculated on amounts in thousands rather than millions.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet Interest Income1Q16 - 4Q151Q16 - 1Q15(In millions)1Q164Q151Q15$%$%Interest and fees on loans$421$430$416$(9)(2)%$51%Interest on money market investments765114235Interest on securities47382710262072Total interest income4754744481Š266Interest on deposits121212(1)(4)Š(2)Interest on short and long-term borrowings101319(3)(23)(9)(47)Interest expense222531(3)(12)(9)(29)Net interest income$453$449$417$41$359Net interest income increased to $453 million in the first quarter of 2016 from $449 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter of 2016, compared to 3.23% in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the prior quarter, the Company realized interest income of $13 million from loan recoveries and FDIC-supported loans that was not repeated in the first quarter. However, higher benchmark interest rates assisted in maintaining and increasing net interest income despite the aforementioned $13 million of elevated interest income in the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by a change in the mix of interest-earning assets; average money market investments declined by $2.7 billion, much of which was deployed into loans and term investment securities. Additionally, net interest income benefited from high cost long-term debt that matured in the fourth quarter of 2015. Interest and fees on loans decreased in the first quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of the previously mentioned interest recoveries on commercial loans that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase of $192 million in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter of 2016.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.Customer-related fees in the first quarter of 2016 were stable compared to the prior quarter and increased 7% from the prior year period. Most of the year-over-year increase was due to an increase in credit card and interchange fees and loan fees. Total noninterest income for the first quarter of 2016 was $117 million, compared to $119 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

The decrease in total noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease of $17 million in other noninterest expense, in addition to reductions in professional and legal services, FDIC premiums, and credit-related expense. The decrease in other noninterest expense was mostly attributable to elevated fourth quarter payments related to the loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC and an elevated fourth quarter accrual for legal-related matters. The decrease in these expenses in the first quarter of 2016 was partially offset by an increase of $22 million in salaries and employee benefits. The primary reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits were a seasonal increase of $6 million in the accrual related to annual restricted stock awards, which historically occurred in the second quarter, a seasonal increase of $7 million in payroll taxes, and a $9 million difference in incentive compensation accrual due to performance related reductions in the fourth quarter of 2015.The Company continued to make meaningful progress with its corporate restructuring and cost initiatives during the quarter.

Further attrition of total oil and gas-related loan balances and commitments during the next several quarters is expected, but at a slower pace than recent quarters. Unfunded lending commitments decreased by $130 million, primarily in the oilfield services and exploration and production portfolios.Consistent with management™s expectations, the majority of loan downgrades in the first quarter of 2016 reflected deterioration in the financial condition of companies in the oilfield services and the exploration and production portfolios. Oil and gas-related loan net charge-offs were $36 million in the first quarter of 2016 and were predominantly in the oilfield services portfolio, compared to $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Nonaccruing loans increased by $220 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily in the exploration and production and oilfield services portfolios. Approximately 91% of oil and gas-related nonaccruing loans were current as to principal and interest payments as of March€31, 2016, up from 71% as of December€31, 2015.

The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are included where applicable in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results. The Company believes that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which will assist regulators, investors, and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the Company and in predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the Company™s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance, for presentations of Company performance to investors, and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts. The Company further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.
