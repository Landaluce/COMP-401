ﬁ During a period when many have asked why banks aren™t doing more 
for small businesses, we take pride in knowing that we are among 
the nation™s leading providers of financing and banking services 
to small and medium sized businesses. The U.S. Small Business 

Administration recently ranked us third in the nation for meeting 

the needs of businesses with financing requirements of between 
$100,000 and $1,000,000. And Greenwich Associates, the nation™s 
premier financial services research firm, recently cited us as the only 

bank in the country to receive ﬁexcellentﬂ scores in every category 

of middle market Treasury Management products and services. 
PRESIDENT™SMESSAGEHarris H. SimmonsChairman, President and CEO
Many banks are currently attempting to increase their commercial 

business lending as a catalyst for loan and revenue growth. At Zions, 
we™ve been focused on this business for a very long time, and we do 
it exceedingly well.ﬂ 
2010 YEAR IN REVIEW1TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:Although the past year was once again a challenging one for Zions 
Bancorporation and for the banking industry generally, there are many 

 indications that economic conditions are strengthening, real estate 
values are stabilizing, and credit quality is significantly improving. Real 
gross domestic product (ﬁGDPﬂ) increased 2.8% in 2010 as compared 

to 0.2% in 2009. The Federal Reserve™s Open Market Committee cur
-rently projects that 2011 real GDP will grow at a rate of 3.4% Œ 3.9%, 

slightly better than the average growth rate of 3.4% over the past 

eighty years. 
What has come to be called the ﬁGreat Recessionﬂ began in late 2007 
and officially ended in June, 2009. But its effects continued to be felt 
in 2010 as persistently high rates of unemployment and ongoing soft
-ness in the housing sector contributed to weak loan demand and the 

continuation of a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates. 
In 2010 we also saw the consummation of legislative and regulatory 
responses to the traumatic events of the past few years in the finan
-
cial services industry. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the

20Actual Sales Changes 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010
issuance of a new capital framework known as Basel III by interna
-tional banking regulators signals the beginning of a new era of more 

stringent regulation of our industry.
A central tenet of both the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III framework 
is a requirement for strengthened capital standards throughout the 
global banking industry. Much of our work over the past year has been 

focused on increasing our capital and reducing risk in our business, 

as both 
 regulators and market participants have been requiring that 
capital positions be taken to higher levels.
Financial ResultsThe Company experienced a net loss applicable to common sharehold
-ers of $412.5 million, or $2.48 per diluted common share in 2010, as 

 compared to a net loss of $1,234.4 million or $9.92 per share in 2009. 
Some of the more significant elements contributing to our financial 
results in 2010 as compared to 2009 were the following:

 Net interest income totaled $1,727.4 million in 2010, a decrease 
of $170.1 million from the prior year. Most of the change, $167.8 

million, is attributable to increased non-cash amortization of dis
-
count resulting from the modification of much of the Company™s 

subordinated debt in 2009, providing the option for debt holders 
to convert their securities to preferred shares. 
 Net impairment expense on our securities portfolio was $85.4 
million in 2010, a reduction of $195.1 million from the 2009 

impairment expense of $280.5 million, reflecting an improving 

trend in the level of actual and expected defaults in our portfolio 

of collateralized debt obligations.
 The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $852.1 million, a 
substantial decrease from the $2,016.9 provision in 2009, owing 
to improved credit quality indicators, particularly in the latter half 

of 2010. Fair value and nonhedge derivative income related to interest rate 

and credit hedges produced a loss of $15.8 million in 2010, com
-
pared to a gain of $113.8 million in 2009. The loss in 2010 included 
$22.8 million as an initial negative fair value for a total return swap 

(ﬁTRSﬂ) we entered into with respect to approximately $1.16 billion 

of investment securities. The TRS transfers all credit risk to a third 

party and significantly improves our regulatory capital ratios.
 Several major extraordinary items incurred in 2009 were absent 

or substantially reduced in 2010 results. Items included $636.2 

million in goodwill impairment charges, a valuation loss of $212.1 

 million on securities purchased, acquisition related gains of 
$169.2 million, and gains resulting from the modification of sub
-
ordinated debt and the termination of related interest rate swaps 

of $508.9 million were absent or substantially reduced in 2010™s 

results. Additionally, gains of $84.6 million were recognized and 

recorded in retained earnings from the redemption or exchange 
of preferred stock into common shares. The income tax benefit totaled $106.8 million in 2010, a reduc
-tion of $294.5 million from the tax benefit recognized in 2009.Loan demand was exceptionally weak in 2010, as both the business 

and consumer sectors continued to reduce their indebtedness in the

wake of the recent recession. As might be expected, this phenom
-enon was especially pronounced in the real estate industry, where 

high levels of residential housing inventory and continuing weakness 

in commercial real estate markets has resulted in very modest levels 

of new construction activity. New housing starts in the Western United 
States in 2010 were essentially flat with the prior year, and about a 
quarter of the level experienced in 2006. 
Net loans and leases decreased by $3.4 billion or 8.6% to $36.7 billion 
 during 2010. Importantly, nearly 60% of the 
 
reduction in loan balances 
was in construction and land development loans. This portfolio cat
-egory has decreased by over $4.3 billion from its peak in 2007, and 

has been reduced from 21.8% of total loans in June 2007 to 9.7% 

of loans in December 2010. Over the past three years, this reduction 
in construction and land development loan balances has constituted 
approximately 180% of the net reduction in total loan and lease bal
-
ances of $2.2 billion. Although this significant reduction in construction 

and development loan balances has had a negative effect on interest 

income, credit risk has been substantially reduced.
The drag on net interest income from reduced lending activity has been 

largely mitigated by the exceptionally strong growth we™ve experienced 

in noninterest bearing demand deposits, and by our determination 

to maintain strong pricing discipline with respect to both loans and 

deposits. While average total deposits decreased 2.6% in 2010, aver
-age noninterest bearing demand deposit balances increased 20.5% 

to $13.3 billion, following a 20.9% increase the preceding year. At the 

same time, weighted average yields on our loans and leases increased 

to 5.71% from 5.65% in 2009, while average rates paid on interest-

bearing deposits decreased to 0.69% from 1.34% the prior year. With 

strong demand deposit growth and weak loan demand, the Company™s 

liquidity profile strengthened considerably during the past year, with 

average borrowed funds decreasing by $1.6 billion and average money 
market investments increasing by $1.7 billion. 
When adjusted for the aforementioned noncash amortization of discount 
on our modified subordinated debt, our net interest margin remains 

among the strongest in the universe of large U.S. banking organizations. 

This is despite the fact that we have been maintaining a great deal of 

our liquidity on deposit with Federal Reserve banks at very low short-

term rates, rather than investing the funds in longer-term fixed rate 
securities with higher rates. This reflects our belief that U.S. interest 

rates are being maintained at abnormally low levels through concerted 

monetary policy actions, and that the risk of a significant increase in 

interest rates in the not-distant future is greater than the foregone 
income from maintaining a short maturity for these investments.
Credit QualityBy most every measure, credit quality improved significantly as the 
past year progressed. After peaking at $5.2 billion in March, classi
-
fied lending-related assets decreased 34.1% to $3.4 billion at year 

end. Classified loans are those we deem to have material weak
-
nesses that, if not corrected, may jeopardize the prospect for full 
payment of principal and interest. Other real estate owned (ﬁOREOﬂ) 
decreased 27.5% from a peak of $414 million in March to $300 

million at year end. Nonperforming lending-related assets Œ a sub
-
set of classified assets consisting of OREO and loans on which we 

have ceased accruing interest because the collection of principal 

and interest in full is unlikely Œ also peaked in March at $2.8 billion, 
and decreased 34.4% in the last nine months of the year to $1.8 

billion at year end. 
Net loan and lease charge-offs decreased 17.4% to $969 million in 
2010 from $1,173 million in 2009, and our expectation is that we will 
see a material reduction in charge-offs in 2011. Nevertheless, we 
believe that the economic environment, while improving, continues 

to present high levels of risk. We have accordingly maintained our 

reserves for potential losses at a conservative level. The allowance for 

credit losses at year end was $1.6 billion, a 5.8% reduction from the 

level a year ago. The allowance was 4.22% of total loans and leases, 

compared to 4.10% a year ago.
Credit losses in our securities portfolio also diminished significantly 
in 2010. Net impairment losses totaled $85.4 million, a 70% reduc
-tion from the 2009 level. We expect this improving trend to continue 

through 2011. As previously mentioned, in July we executed a total 

return swap with regard to $1.16 billion of 
 collateralized debt obliga
-tions (ﬁCDOsﬂ), transferring the credit risk on these securities to a third 
party. This had the effect of substantially 
 improving the credit profile 
and regulatory risk weightings on these securities.
2010 YEAR IN REVIEW5Building Our CapitalZions Bancorporation, like most every major bank in the United States 
and throughout the world, has taken a number of steps to strengthen 

its  capital over the course of the recent economic cycle. In 2010, we 
raised $885 million in common equity through the sale of shares and 
 warrants, and through the exchange of subordinated debt into common 
equity. We also increased our preferred equity by $542 million through 

the  issuance of new shares, and through the conversion of subordi
-nated debt into preferred stock. 
Over the past three years, through the course of this economic cycle, 
we™ve raised $2.2 billion in additional regulatory ﬁTier 1ﬂ capital, 

excluding TARP capital and the net effect of accounting gains from the 
modification of subordinated debt. The capital we™ve raised has con
-sisted of $1.7 billion in new common equity, and $0.5 billion in net new 

preferred equity. Additionally, we™ve increased the allowance for credit 

losses by the net amount of $1.1 billion during this period.These extraordinary actions have been costly, resulting in a net issu
-ance of 75.7 million common shares during this period, a 71% increase 
in outstanding shares. Nevertheless, we believe the variety of methods 

we™ve used to raise capital have minimized, to the extent possible, 

dilutive effects to our shareholders while allowing us to bolster our 

capital through a difficult economic period. At year end 2010, our Tier 

1 risk-based capital ratio was 14.78%, compared to 10.53% a year 

ago; our Tier 1 common ratio was 8.95%, compared to 6.73% at year 
end 2009.Our Changing Regulatory Environment
History has shown that, virtually without exception, significant changes 
to the legislative and regulatory framework in which our industry oper
-ates always come in response to periods of economic turmoil. This 

economic cycle has proven to be no exception, with the passage in 

2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act. This statute will produce the most sweeping changes in financial 
services regulation since the Great Depression, and was the climax of 

a series of regulatory and legislative responses to the events of the 

past three years in our economy. Late in 2010 the Basel Committee 

on Banking Supervision also issued new standards for global bank 
6supervision of capital and liquidity, known as Basel III. These new 
standards, when combined with the numerous regulations to be issued 

under the Dodd-Frank Act, will result in significant changes in our 

industry™s regulatory environment. 
The Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions that are intended 
to better enable regulators to wind down large or complex failing 

 institutions. Among many other provisions, the statute allows for the 
payment of interest on business checking accounts; introduces new 

constraints on incentive compensation arrangements; requires that 

bank holding company capital standards be no less stringent than stan
-
dards for depository institutions; phases out trust preferred securities 

as a source of capital for larger financial institutions; prohibits many 

types of proprietary trading and investing activities; and establishes a 
new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with broad authority to 
establish and enforce consumer protection rules with respect to finan
-
cial products and services.
One of the more significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act for 
Zions Bancorporation is the designation of bank holding companies 
with total assets of $50 billion or more as ﬁSystemically Important 

Financial Institutions.ﬂ Zions, together with other designated firms, 

will be required to engage in a variety of enhanced risk management 

practices, including ﬁstress testingﬂ its balance sheet for purposes of 

determining capital adequacy. New capital requirements promulgated 
under the Dodd-Frank Act, when combined with the capital standards 
established under Basel III, will also require us to maintain higher lev
-
els of capital, and particularly of common equity. 
A feature of the legislation which will likely be particularly costly is 
known as the ﬁDurbin Amendment.ﬂ It requires the Federal Reserve 

Board to establish price controls on interchange fees received by 

issuers of debit cards. Preliminary estimates based on the proposed 

regulation pegs the annual total cost to the commercial banking indus
-try at between $12 billion and $15 billion; we estimate that it will cost 
Zions Bancorporation 
 approximately $50 million, per year, pretax. As a 
result of this and other costly new regulations, most banks Œ including 
our own Œ will re-price consumer deposit accounts and other products 

and services to at least partially adjust for the shortfall.

2010 YEAR IN REVIEW7It remains a challenging time for banks. The good news is that the 
products and services we provide are critical to a growing economy. 

We are not obsolete. And there is a growing notion Œ a ﬁGoldilocksﬂ 

sentiment, if you will Œ that regional banking firms such as ours, which 

are neither too large to be effectively managed, nor too small to pro

that do an outstanding job of serving their customers, will play a much 

larger role in the financial services industry in the years ahead. 
Zions Bancorporation is well positioned to meet that challenge. We have 
a superb reputation for meeting the needs of our customers. The U.S. 

Small Business Administration recently ranked us third in the nation 

for meeting the needs of small businesses with credit requirements of 

between $100,000 and $1 million. Zions is the only such large bank
-ing organization in the Western U.S. that Greenwich Associates, the 
nation™s premier financial services research firm, recently cited as one

thousands of commercial customers surveyed in both the Small and 

Middle Market Business segments, and the only bank in the nation 
to receive Excellent ratings in every single facet of Middle Market 

Treasury Management products and services. We serve some of the 

very best markets in the nation, and we have an extraordinary team 

of banking professionals who have become stronger as a result of the

Together, they bring over 30 years of experience in design, manufacturing and distribution of 

postal products. They have built a team of dedicated professionals committed to providing pre

designs are developed and tested in-house with an eye to providing an aesthetically pleasing 

design while maintaining quality workmanship and providing a safe and secure environment for 

mail and parcel receipt.During 2010, the company determined that it needed additional financing capacity in order to 
support the operational growth of the business. As Chris and Vanessa started reaching out to 

other financial institutions, it became apparent that the banks they were speaking to were not 
making the necessary effort in order to gain comfort for new financing. The issue, in large part, 
involved an operating loss the company reported in 2009 tied to a number of special items and 

the untimely closure of Expo, a large customer and subsidiary of The Home Depot. Expo was a 

significant product channel for the company in terms of visibility and revenue.
Fortunately, Chris and Vanessa maintained a long-standing banking relationship with California 
Bank & Trust bankers John Hartwig and Chris Dewhurst. Throughout the years, California Bank 

& Trust worked closely with the company establishing a consistent line of communication. When 
the time came to assess additional financing, the bank worked closely with Vanessa and Chris 
to map their future plans for expansion and prioritize needs by grasping the intricacies of the 

company, their position and reputation in the mailbox manufacturing space and understanding 
the ramifications of the fallout that resulted from the failure of Expo. In conjunction with a thor
-ough review of the realized and forecasted expansion of the company, California Bank & Trust 
gained the comfort that other institutions could not and renewed a line of credit that included an 

increase for additional capital. Vanessa remembers that they were ﬁgood at listening to what our 

concerns were and working with us on what we could afford, our plan, and helping us modify 

plans using their expertise and background. If you share the good and the bad, the bank rolls 

with the punches.ﬂVanessa now predicts that Architectural Mailboxes will see about 38 percent growth in the

financing companies. As a result of the recent economic downturn, Elephant™s Delicatessen 
sought additional banking guidance and services in order to provide business stability in hopes

PORTS, founded in 1995, is a national leader in indoor sports facilities, provid

Sports is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life in communities by providing high quality, fun 

and safe sports and recreation for people of all ages. In fact, Arena Sports has grown to offer 

leagues, clinics and classes for adults, youth and children to more than 80,000 participants. 
Nearly 25,000 individuals on 2,000 teams participate in league play and another 60,000 indi
-viduals attend classes, camps and clinics each year.
In 2005, Arena Sports attempted to establish the first public-private joint venture with the city 
of Seattle in an effort to refurbish a historic 90,000 square foot Navy WWII Hanger at Seattle™s 

Magnuson Park (Formerly Navy Air Base Sandpoint). Estimates of an $8.6 million project expense 

proved to be too large for a company that was still building on its early successes. In view of 

that, the company sought the services of The Commerce Bank of Washington (ﬁTCBWﬂ) which 
initially developed a solution that included a $5.3 million loan from TCBW and a Small Business 
Administration loan application of up to $2.0 million. Supplementary to this outcome, continued 

efforts by Arena Sports were rewarded with a $1.6 million federal historical tax credit to be 

applied towards the project. Unfortunately, after nine months of coordinating with the SBA group, 

a once promising SBA loan fell apart due to transaction complexities.
In spite of the setback in obtaining financing, Arena Sports flourished as the souring economy 
influenced families to find cheaper entertainment alternatives. Coupled with the heightened 
exposure of the 2010 World Cup, parents signed up their young kids in record numbers. The 
city of Seattle contacted Arena Sports after the Obama Administration came out with the 

American Recovery Act. Arena Sports qualified for the Recovery Zone Facility Bond program. 

TCBW worked with the company, the city of Seattle, Zions Capital Markets and local counsel to 

help Arena Sports receive $6.0 million in proceeds from bonds issued to support investments 
in Washington™s local development, energy conservation and infrastructure projects. If it were 
not for TCBW™s confidence in ownership and management teams along with the hard work of all 

parties involved, this project would not have reached its success. Today the facility is a gem in 

Seattle™s 350 acre park on the shores of Lake Washington and a shining example of how public-

private joint venture with the city can work. The company is off to a very strong start in 2011 and 

the newly-renovated facility finished sign-ups for winter quarter–up 125%.

Ozuna Family 
2010 YEAR IN REVIEW19HABITAT
 FOR H
UMANITY Œ The foreclosure crisis in Arizona has devastated families 
and caused deterioration in many neighborhoods. In the summer of 2010, one of the homes 
taken back through foreclosure by National Bank of Arizona was in Glendale, Arizona. During the 

process, people in the neighborhood kept the Bank informed of activities in the area, especially 

as they related to this particular home. The home was in a state of almost total disrepair. The 
neighbors were concerned for the overall well being of their quiet, older neighborhood. Many of 
the residents had been there since the development was completed back in the 1960™s.
Dave Zanath, National Bank of Arizona™s Real Estate Manager approached the Community 
Reinvestment Officer Kathy Pechman to see if there was a non-profit who would accept the home 

as a donation, help a deserving family and help preserve the neighborhood. She approached 

Roger Schweirjohn, President of Habitat for Humanity Central Arizona. They gladly accepted 

the donation and the transaction was completed in July 2010. Habitat quickly contacted the 
neighborhood representatives to let them know they would be seeing people coming and going 
and that renovation on the home would start in October. Habitat agreed to have National Bank of 

Arizona employees assist in the 7 week rehab project. 
The Ozuna family was selected for the home, and went through credit counseling and first time 
home buyer classes in order to qualify for their mortgage with Habitat for Humanity Central 

Arizona. Lorenza Ozuna is a single mom with two daughters. She works for Cox Communications 

in Phoenix. In order to afford the rent on their previous home, they needed a boarder living with 
them which meant Lorenz shared a room with her daughters.(from left, back row): 



(sitting):


Each week, a different group of National Bank of Arizona employees teamed up with Habitat to 
completely renovate the home. There were 118 bank employees and family members who par
-ticipated. National Bank of Arizona executive leaders Keith Maio, Deborah Bateman, Curt Hansen, 

Pete Hill, Dianne James, Zac Price, Craig Robb and Greg Wessel supported the 
 project through 
service and by encouraging their teams to join them as they built walls, painted, sanded and 
landscaped each week. Since the renovation was completed other homeowners in the neighbor
-hood have started sprucing up their homes with paint, new roofs and improved landscaping.
ﬁThis project demonstrated National Bank of Arizona™s commitment to the communities where we 
do business,ﬂ said Kathleen Pechman. ﬁIt allowed us to come together as a team, without regard 

for title or job function, and work to provide a safe, affordable home to a deserving family.ﬂ

2010 YEAR IN REVIEW21LAKEVIEW C
HEESE Œ Founder Greg Gaglio has been in the cheese and food distribu
-tion industry for more than 30 years. He learned the trade from his father who owned a cheese 

factory in Italy. Prior to opening the company with his wife Debbie in 2009, Greg owned and 

operated several different cheese plants and food distribution companies nationwide.
At their southern Nevada facility, Lakeview Cheese grates Parmesan and Romano cheeses, 
and shreds and dices both natural and imitation cheese varieties. They produce an assortment 

of custom blends and private label products for the food service, retail and food processing 

industries. In addition to processing their own cheeses, they also distribute a wide variety of 

cheese products.Since its inception in mid-2009, Lakeview Cheese has experienced explosive growth. As a 
result, they needed to establish a new line of credit in order to expand the existing facility, 
purchase new equipment and set up a new operating line. At the time, Lakeview Cheese had a 

30+ year relationship with a large, national financial institutionŠa relationship that included 

 significant deposit accounts, a $3 million business line of credit, personal mortgage and credit 
cards. Despite their considerable account holdings with the existing institution, Greg and Debbie 

wanted to explore other financing options. 
Seeking a smaller bank that could provide quality, personalized service, Lakeview Cheese 
reached out to Nevada State Bank to determine whether it could meet their expansion needs. 
Relationship manager Rosalee Hedrick and her Small Business Development colleagues imme
-
diately recognized the potential opportunity with Lakeview Cheese. 









After an initial visit with the owners, Rosalee conducted an extensive tour of the facility and 
was able to affirm Nevada State Bank™s ability to support Greg and Debbie™s thriving business. 

The first step was to establish an equipment loan and operating line of credit for the company. 

Since then, the company opened a deposit account, received two credit line increases, and 

was approved for a company credit card. In addition, Lakeview Cheese management met with 
Nevada State Bank™s Treasury Management group and will soon be benefiting from their added 
financial services. 
At the end of November 2010, the company approached $26 million in gross revenuesŠa figure 
projected to reach $50 million by the end of 2011. Greg is expecting to introduce a new line of 

Mexican cheese within the next few months and anticipates that the company will reach $80 
million in revenues within the next couple of years.

2010 YEAR IN REVIEW23GTM S
ALES Œ 
After growing up as the son of an oilfield and heavy highway contractor in the 
Pennsylvania oilfields and graduating from The University of Pittsburgh as a civil engineer, Griff 
Bell spent 25 years honing his heavy construction and oilfield skills working for various large 

general contractors, a major Caterpillar dealership and then a 10 year stint with Ritchie Bros. 

Auctioneers International before founding GTM Sales, Inc. in April 1996. Specializing in large, 
used Caterpillar scrapers, dozers, loaders, off highway trucks and graders as well as heavy spec 
and mechanic trucks, the company grew to become a recognized leader as a supplier of ﬁquality 

used equipment for the contractorﬂ on a worldwide scale. With strong growth in the home build
-
ing and construction sectors from 1996 to 2005, GTM™s gross sales grew to exceed $33 million 

in 2005. But as the U.S. fell into the recent recession, sales fell dramatically to roughly $7 million 

in 2009 Œ the company™s worst year since inception.
During unpredictable and challenging times, GTM always maintained its operations with minimal 
overhead. It did so by maximizing productivity through its 10 full-time employees and several 
additional subcontractors. But as the economy worsened and sales continued to fall, GTM, in 

order to survive, was forced to drastically cut operating expenses by reducing its staff by 60% 

and applying reduced pay levels and benefit packages to its remaining employees. Despite the 

effort to reduce costs to weather the storm, Griff felt his business was still threatened given the 

news circulating in the media regarding reduced and/or frozen credit linesŠa lifeline to GTMs 

business modelŠto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 



After expressing this concern with its key financial partner, Vectra Bank Colorado, GTM gained 
comfort in realizing the bank was committed to maintaining the relationship. With the help and 

patience of Vectra Bank Colorado, a new credit structure was established which allowed the 

company to continue to access funds under its credit line with the flexibility to access additional 

credit to reflect demand changes as economic and business conditions recover. This achieve
-ment allowed GTM to manage its inventory to fit the needs and pricing of today™s clientele and 
new economy. For 2010, GTM realized sales exceeding $13 million and is once again positioned 

to grow as the economy rebounds. Equally exciting, sales in 2011 have been extremely favorable 

compared to sales a year ago.

SCENTSY is a direct selling, wickless candle company 
 
headquartered in Meridian, Idaho. The 
company is owned by Orville and Heidi Thompson and sells its products through a field sales 
force of independent sales representatives known as Independent Scentsy Consultants, who 

market and sell Scentsy products through home parties. The story of Scentsy is the story of how 

a simple ideaŠoffer a safe, wickless alternative to scented candles through home partiesŠ
grew into one of the most successful companies that the direct selling industry has ever seen. 
Since establishing its direct selling model in July 2004, Scentsy has experienced phenomenal 

growth in both revenue and the number of consultants.
The significant amount of growth Scentsy is realizing has been counter-cyclical to the rest of 
the economy. Realizing that they needed additional working capital capacity at a time when the 

banking industry was practicing strict credit terms, Orville and Heidi looked to their proven bank
-
ing relationship with Zions Bank. For the Thompson™s, it was important to explore options with 
Zions because the bank previously demonstrated faith in the business during another complex 
environment in 2007 and when others had difficulty grasping the trajectory of the business. 
The significant amount of growth the company was experiencing was familiar to Zions Bank. 
Coupled with the banks confidence in Orville and Heidi™s accomplished ability to manage a pros
-
pering business provided the assurance to be able to offer a large incremental increase in the 




2010 YEAR IN REVIEW25company™s line of credit, despite a wavering economy. Furthermore, Zions Bank assisted Scentsy 
in obtaining additional credit via the Recovery Zone Bonds initiative established in 2009. The pro
-
ceeds received by Scentsy will be used to construct a new warehouse and distribution facilities 

that will consolidate many of Scentsy™s campuses and create much needed expansion space.
Today, the company™s family of more than 100,000 passionate Independent Scentsy Consultants 
shares the Scentsy experience and the Scentsy difference throughout the United States, Puerto 

Rico, Guam, and Canada, with a European expansion currently underway.
