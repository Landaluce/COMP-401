In 2014,
 BB&T
 made
 important investments
 to meet
 our
 long-term
 objective
 of growing,
 sustained
 and
 predictable
 returns
 for
 our
 clients,
 associates,
 communities
 and
 shareholders.
To succeed
 in a challenging
 banking
 environment,
 we believe
 diversi˜cation
 and
 scale
 are
 becoming increasingly
 important with
 higher
 regulatory
 and
 other
 costs.
 We continued
 to make
 investments
 to expand
 our
 Mid-Atlantic
 franchise
 and
 our
 rapidly
 growing
 Texas
 presence.
 At the
 same
 time,
 we have
 built
 the
 infrastructure
 we need
 to succeed
 in an increasingly competitive
 world,
 while
 remaining
 relentless
 in eliminating
 expenses
 we do not
 need.
Anchoring
 BB&T™s
 strategy
 is the
 marketplace™s
 best
 value proposition
 based
 on quality
 and
 our
 most
 important
 distinguishing
 characteristic
 Œ a common
 culture
 committed
 to our
 vision
 of creating
 the
 best
 ˜nancial
 institution
 possible.
 We do
 not say
 ﬁlargestﬂ
 because
 we
 do not
 believe
 in
 growth
 for
 growth™s
 sake.
 We
 grow
 because
 that
 is how
 we optimize
 the
 long-term
 return
 to our
 shareholders.
 And
 we do not
  
say
 ﬁbestﬂ
 to brag.
 That
 commitment
 is affirmed
 by consistent
 independent
 rankings
 demonstrating
 BB&T™s
 superior
 service
 quality.
At BB&T,
 we
 believe
 leadership
 drives
 our
 growth.
 We help
 our
 associates
 grow
 and
 become
 better
 leaders
 through
 training
 and
 education.
 We help
 our
 clients lead
 and
 grow
 their
 businesses. When
 we help
 our
 clients™
 leadership
 teams
 become
 more
 effective,
 for
 example,
 they
 make
 better
 decisions,
 their businesses
 grow
 faster
 and
 we
 get
 more
 loans,
 deposits
 and
 fees.
 We give
 back
 to
 our
 communities
 so they
 grow
 into
 better
 places
 to live
 and
 do business.
 If our
 associates,
 clients
 and
 communities
 grow,
 we
 grow
 Œ and
 our
 shareholders
 bene˜t.
 Everyone
 wins.
While
 most
 banks
 are measured
 by traditional
 offerings
 like
 loans
 and
 deposits
 Œ and
 BB&T
 excels
 by
 those
 measures
 Œ we
 believe
 another
 important
 quality
 is how
 we help
 our
 clients
 and
 communities
 grow
 through
 leadership
 development.
 In 2014,
 we increased
 our
 investment
 in leadership
 by sharing
 our
 time-tested
 leadership
 model
 with
 our
 clients
 and
 the next
 generation
 of leaders
 through
 programs
 for
 educators
 and
 students.
 We will
 signi˜cantly
 expand
 that
 investment
 through The
 BB&T
 Leadership
 Institute
 in 2015.
We are
 optimistic
 about
 2015
 because
 of our
 accomplishments
  
in 2014,
 including:
Significantly
 broadening
 our
 franchise
 in the
 attractive
 Mid-
Atlantic
 region
. Our
 plan
 to acquire
 Susquehanna Bancshares
 opens
 exciting
 new
 opportunities
 in the
 contiguous
 states
 of Pennsylvania
 and
 New
 Jersey,
 including
 the
 af˚uent
 Philadelphia
 market,
 while
 also
 improving
 our
 market
 share
 in Maryland
 and
 Baltimore.
 In addition,
 our
 pending
 acquisition
 of The Bank
 of Kentucky
 gives
 us access
 to diversi˜ed
 markets
 in northern
 Kentucky
 and
 greater Cincinnati™s
 rich
 base
 of corporate
 banking
 and
 capital
 markets
 clients.
Building
 our
 base
 in the
 vibrant
 Texas
 market.
 Our
 acquisition
 of a total
 of 62 Citibank
 branches doubles
 our
 presence
 in Dallas
 and
 creates
 retail
 and
 commercial
 banking
 opportunities
 in other
 fast-growing
 markets
 such
 as Bryan-College Station,
 Houston
 and
 Midland.
 Since
 we
 entered
 Texas
 with
 the
 Colonial
 Bank
 acquisition
 in
 2009,
 BB&T™s
 market
 share has
 grown from
 51st
 to 12th.
Continued
 national
 expansion
 of
 our
 Capital
 Markets
 Corporate
 Banking
 capabilities.
 With
 eight
 national
 loan
 production
 of˜ces,
 including
 a new
 corporate
 banking
 team
 based
 in New
 York
 City
 to serve
 clients
 in the
 Northeast,
 we are
 positioning
 BB&T
 to be an active
 market
 participant
 as the economy
 improves
 and
 corporate
 America
 makes
 needed
 infrastructure
 investments.
Leveraging
 our
 large
 insurance
 business.
 Insurance
 is the
 leading
 driver
 of our
 diversi˜cation,
 representing
 18%
 of BB&T
 revenue,
 and
 we™re
 now
 the ˜fth-largest
 insurance
 distributor
 in the U.S.
 Among
 the
 new
 growth
 opportunities:
 offering
 life
 insurance
 products
 acquired
 through
 our
 2012
 Crump

 to our
 wealth

 and
 employee-bene˜t
 packages
 acquired
 through
 our
 2011
 Precept
 Group
 acquisition
 to our
 small business
 clients.
Broad
 improvement
 in our
 credit
 quality.
 Our
 strongest
 performance
 in seven
 years
 is
 a
 reflection
 of
 BB&T™s
 long-held
 conservative
 principles
 and
 significant
 investment
 in a
 comprehensive
 risk
 governance
 system.

Extending our specialized lending and dealer financial services. 
Now 14% of our revenues, these businesses provide additional 

products and services to our clients while increasing our geographic 

and revenue diversi˜cation. One of many examples is our equipment 

˜nance business, with a ˜ve-year compound annual growth rate 
 of 23%, working in tandem with our corporate bankers. (See page 16.)
Expanding our retail delivery options.
 We™re constantly improving 
our online banking experience to meet clients™ rapidly changing 
preferences. Today, 25% of our checking and savings account clients 

use our mobile banking services, up from 3% only four years ago, 
 and we are planning exciting new offerings for our clients in the 

future. Keynote has ranked BB&T ˜rst for overall customer experience 

among U.S. retail banking websites for three straight years.
Continued investment in cutting-edge processes.
 Our new general 
ledger and risk governance systems increase our ef˜ciency, give us an 
edge over our peers and proactively address new banking regulations.
Rewarding our shareholders.
 We have achieved higher returns with 
lower volatility than our peers over the last 10 years, and have one 
 of the best dividend yields.

Our accomplishments are noteworthy at a time when our country 
and industry still face challenges. While we remain encouraged 

by an improving U.S. economy and signs of positive change in 

Washington, we must remain vigilant. In 2015, we expect still-tepid 

domestic growth, a volatile global environment, higher regulatory 

costs, and increasing competition from traditional banks and new 

entrants seeking to win parts of our business. We also recognize 

that most of our competitors offer the same products and, candidly, 

similar strategies. We know the most successful companies will be 

those with the best execution of their strategies. In turn, excellent 

execution requires consistency of purpose and an environment where 

everyone is engaged in pursuing a common goal.
Careful readers of our annual reports will notice a consistency 
 in our message. This is not accidental. The consistency reflects 
our fundamental view that successful businesses are operated for 

the long term. We don™t respond to fads and engage in short-term 

thinking. We don™t remake ourselves every few years. For example, 

when we expanded our presence in Florida in 2009 in the middle 
 of the recession, the pundits were warning of the state™s demise amid 

overbuilding. We preferred to look at the long term: nearly 20 million 

people live in Florida and it™s warm in the winter. Since then, Florida 

has become one of BB&T™s most lucrative markets. We™re now hearing 

some of the same short-term thinking about Texas because of worries 

that lower oil prices will impact the state™s large energy sector. Our 

response: 27 million people live in Texas, with 1,000 more moving 

there every day, attracted by the nation™s strongest job market. 
We believe profitability and predictability go hand in hand. Our 

community banks have been operating largely the same for 30 

years, with local autonomy and responsiveness that results in 

consistently better client service quality. Our client service has won 

top scores year after year from respected research organizations. 
 Our acquisition strategy also has been consistent over the years 

as we have steadily built our franchise by acquiring banks with 

contiguous markets, long heritages and compatible cultures Œ most 

recently with the announced Susquehanna transaction.
Our long-term view also extends to our communities. We believe in 
helping our communities for two reasons: it™s the right thing to do, 

and frankly, it helps our bottom line. Banks are nothing more than 

a reflection of our communities. Among my proudest moments 
 is watching BB&T™s associates volunteer in community-service projects 

as part of our Lighthouse Project Œ more than 6,600 projects, touching 

the lives of 9.7 million people, since we launched the project six years 

ago to help our communities as they struggled through the recession.
Our long-term consistency is most deeply rooted in our value system. 
We believe the best and only way to operate a large organization 
 is to make sure that everyone holds, and lives, the same fundamental 

values. At BB&T, we talk with our associates constantly about 

the values of character, judgment, success and happiness. Why 

happiness? Because if associates are happy in their lives, they have 

a sense of self-esteem and pride in their work and believe they™re 

doing something worthwhile Œ and they are at BB&T. That is not just 

a bromide with us. It is the way we live. We come in every morning 

to help our clients and communities be successful. We believe it is the 

most important part of our business. Those values have served us well 

for 143 years, and will continue to serve us for many decades to come.

BB&T
 produced
 record
 earnings
 in 2014,
 with
 strong
 performances
 throughout
 the
 company
 reflecting
 the effectiveness
 of our
 key
 strategies.
 Net
 income
 available
 to common
 shareholders
 increased
 more
 than
 25%
 to a record
 $2 billion
 for
 the
 year.
 Our
 diversi˜ed
 fee-income
 businesses,
 including insurance,
 investment
 banking,
 bankcard
 and
 trust,
 reported
 record
 revenue.
 We produced
 solid
 growth
 in both
 loans
 and
 lower-cost
 deposits.
 We very
 effectively
 controlled
 expenses.
 Our
 credit
 quality
 indicators
 all
 showed
 sharp
 improvement.
 Our
 capital
 levels
 remained
 strong across
 the
 board.
 Earnings
 per
 diluted
 share increased
 25.6%
 to $2.75
 for
 2014,
 compared
 with
 $2.19
 in 2013.
 Average
 loans
 and
 leases,
 excluding
 loans
 acquired
 from
 the
 FDIC,
 grew
 by 3.6%,
 a solid
 performance
 in a relatively
 slow
 economy.
 The
 growth
 was
 broad-based,
 including
 corporate
 lending,
 auto
 lending,
 commercial
 real
 estate
 lending
 and
 retail
 lending.
 The
 4.8%
 growth
 in commercial
 real
 estate
 re˚ected
 improvement
 in several
 areas
 hurt
 by the
 recession,
 including single-family
 construction,
 industrial
 and
 hospitality.
 Thanks
 to excellent
 execution
 by
 our
 community
 bank,
 we enjoyed
 strong
 momentum
 in direct
 retail
 loans,
 led
 by home
 equity
 lines
 of
 credit.
 Our
 specialized
 lending
 businesses,
 including
 Grandbridge
 Real Estate
 Capital
 and
 Shef˜eld
 Financial
 power
 and sports
 equipment
 finance,
 reported
 strong
 growth.
 Residential
 mortgages
 declined
 as part
 of
 our
 decision
  
in 2014
 to
 sell
 a larger
 portion
 of our
 mortgage
 originations
 and
 to sell
 non-performing
 loans.
 We achieved loan
 growth
 in a competitive
 market
 through
 our
 strategies
 and
 diversi˜cation,
 not
 by lowering
 underwriting
 standards.
 We believe
 our
 core
 loan
 growth
 rate
 for
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 of
 6.2%,
 which
 excludes
 residential
 mortgages,
 seasonal
 ˚uctuations
 and
 expected
 runoff of
 FDIC-covered
 loans
 acquired
 in our
 Colonial
 acquisition,
 best
 determines
 future
 earnings
 opportunities,
 assuming
 stability
 in the broader
 economy.
 We
 are
 optimistic
 about
 continued
 solid
 loan growth
 in 2015,
 provided
 the
 economy
 continues
 to improve.
 Average
 noninterest-bearing
 deposits
 increased
 by 10.0%
 in 2014
 compared
 with
 the
 prior
 year,
 re˚ecting
 the
 success
 of our
 strategy
 to grow
 lower-cost
 deposits.
 The
 mix
 of noninterest
 deposit
 balances
 to total
 deposits
 improved
 to 28.9%
 in
 2014
 from
 26.4%
 in 2013
 and
 20.4%
 in
 2011.
 We have
 made
 signi˜cant
 progress
 in growing
  
and
 diversifying
 our
 deposits
 in recent
 years.
Our
 strong
 results
 were
 driven
 partly
 by across-the-board
 improvement
 in credit
 quality.
 Total
 nonperforming
 assets
 as
  
a percentage
 of average
 assets
 declined
 every
 quarter
 to 0.42%
 at year
 end.
 Delinquent
 loans,
 both
 early stage
 and
 those
 90 or more
 days
 past
 due,
 continued
 to fall.
 Net
 charge-offs
 for
 the fourth
 quarter
 were
 0.39%
 of average
 loans, an
 18.3%
 decrease
 from
 the third
 quarter
 of 2014.
 Our
 allowance
 coverage
 ratios remain
 strong.
BB&T™s
 fully
 taxable
 equivalent
 net
 interest income
 declined
 4.3%
  
to
 $5.5
 billion
 and
 the
 net
 interest
 margin
 declined
 to
 3.42%
 from
 3.68%
 in
 2013.
 Both
 declines
 were
 anticipated,
 reflecting in
 part
 lower
 interest
 rates
 on new
 loans.
 All banks
 are
 challenged
 to grow
 interest
 income in
 this
 prolonged
 low-rate
 environment.
 The
 net
 interest
 margin,
 key
 to a bank™s
 pro˜tability,
 is the
 difference
 between
 the
 interest
 received
 on loans
 and
 investments
 and
 the
 interest
 paid
 on deposits
 and
 other
 funding,
 expressed
 as a percentage
 of average
 earning
 assets.
 Our
 margin
 still
 compares
 favorably
 with
 the
 3.12%
 average
 of our
 peers,
 and
 should
 remain
 fairly
 stable
 due
 to our
 ability
 to offset
 lower
 new
 loan
 yields
 with an
 improved
 funding mix.
 The
 margin
 could
 improve
 slightly
 later
 in 2015
 if the
 Federal
 Reserve starts
 to increase interest
 rates,
 as anticipated
 in the middle
 of the
 year.

 pending
 acquisition
 of Susquehanna
 Bancshares
 opens opportunities
 for
 BB&T
 to create
 new
 relationships,
 and
 deepen
 existing
 ones,
 with
 top
 corporations
 in greater
 Philadelphia.
 One

 is Liberty
 Property
 Trust,
 a BB&T
 client
 since

The
 $8.9
 billion
 real

 to a 58-story

 in 2008,
 both
 for

 Corporation.
 State-
of-the-art
 offices
 being
 developed
 by
 Liberty
 also
 are
 giving
 new
 life
 to the
 reborn
  
Philadelphia
 Navy

 BB&T
 was selected
 as a participant
 in Liberty™s
 line
 of credit
 because
 of
 its stability,
 strong
 interest in
 the
 REIT
 industry
 and
 ﬁa footprint
 that
 overlays
 nicely

Our
 noninterest
 income
 totaled
 $3.8
 billion
 for
 the
 year,
 down
 3.9%
 from
 2013,
 but
 ˜nished
 the
 year
 with
 a very
 strong
 fourth
 quarter
 performance,
 exceeding
 $1 billion,
 a 29% annualized
 increase
 compared
 with
 the prior
 quarter.
 The
 increase
 was
 driven
 by insurance,
 mortgage
 banking,
 investment
 banking
 and
 brokerage.
 Insurance
 income
 was
 up
 8.3%
 in
 2014,
 the
 best
 year
 in
 our
 history,
 due
 to new
 business
 growth
 and
 client
 retention.
 Mortgage
 banking
 was
 down
 for
 the
 year
 as the
 refinance
 boom
 ended
 in 2014.
 However,
 applications
 and
 income
 improved
 in the fourth
 quarter,
 re˚ecting
 higher
 net
 mortgage
 servicing
 rights
 performance.
 Investment
 banking
 and
 brokerage
 enjoyed
 a record
 year,
 bene˜ting
 from
 increased
 capital
 markets
 activity.
 BB&T™s
 fee
 income
 ratio
 increased
 to a record
 44.3%
 for
 the
 year,
 compared with
 our
 peer
 average
 of 37.5%.
 A higher
 value
 indicates
 a bank
 is producing
 more
 of its
 revenue
 from
 noninterest
 income
 and
 re˚ects
 the
 success
 of
 our
 strategy
 diversifying
 our
 sources
 of income.
Our
 intense
 focus
 on controlling
 BB&T™s
 expenses
 resulted
 in a 13%
 reduction
 in BB&T™s
 adjusted
 noninterest
 expense
 in the fourth
 quarter,
 due
 largely
 to lower
 insurance-related
 and
 information
 technology
 costs,
 and
 a decline in
 full-time
 equivalent
 positions.
 In part
 because
 of our
 long-term
 investment
 in risk
 management
 and
 other
 systems
 and
 the
 impact
 of some
 costs that
 will
 not
 recur,
 expenses
 increased
 slightly
 to $5.9
 billion
 for
 the
 year.
 Our
 ef˜ciency
 ratio
 Œ which
 measures
 expenses
 as a percentage
 of revenues,
 so lower
 percentages
 signal
 better
 performance
 Œ improved
 to 56.7%
 in the
 fourth
 quarter
 of 2014
 from
 59.9%
 a year
 earlier,
 and
 compares
 favorably
 with
 the fourth
 quarter
 average
 of our
 peers.
 We remain
 committed
 to tightly controlling
 our
 expenses
 in 2015.
BB&T™s
 return
 on average
 assets
 was
 a solid
 1.20%,
 up from
 .95%
 in 2013,
 and
 superior
 to
 our
 peer
 average
 of
 1.07%.
 Our return
 on
 average
 common shareholders™
 equity
 increased
 to 9.40%
 from
 8.06%,
 and
 was
 superior
 to our
 peer
 average
 of 9.10%.
 A key
 to superior
 long-term
 returns
 is minimum
 volatility.
 Some companies
 are
 comfortable
 seeking
 higher
 returns
 with higher
 risk.
 We are
 not.
 Over
 the
 last
 10 years,
 we have
 achieved
 superior
 performance
 with
 less
 volatility
 than
 our
 peers.
 Our
 pre-tax
 pro˜tability
 relative
 to assets
 averaged
 2.2%,
 compared
 to 1.8%
 for
 our
 national
 peers.
 For
 the same
 10-year
 period,
 BB&T™s
 standard
 deviation
 of that
 measure
 was
 0.3%,
 compared
 to 0.4%
 for
 our
 national
 peers.
In
 summary,
 BB&T
 continued
 to signi˜cantly
 improve
 our
 ˜nancial
 performance
 in 2014
 with
 positive
 growth
 trends
 in key
 areas,
 including
 loans
 and
 deposits,
 and
 fee
 income,
 combined
 with
 strong
 and
 improving
 credit
 quality
 and
 expense control.
 All of our
 long-
term
 strategies
 are
 showing
 excellent
 results.
 We feel
 very positive
 about
 our
 prospects
 in 2015
 and
 beyond.

The
 bottom
 line
 of our
 mission
 is to optimize
 the
 long-term
 return
  
to our
 shareholders,
 while
 providing
 a safe
 and
 sound
 investment.
  
We
 achieve
 that
 through
 steady
 performance,
 less
 volatility
 in our
 results,
 and
 growth
 in our
 diverse
 franchise,
 our
 dividends
 and
 ultimately
 our
 share
 price.
The
 emphasis
 is on long
 term.
 We believe
 the
 best
 long-term
 measure
 of stock
 performance
 is total
 return
 to shareholders,
 which
 includes
 the
 change in
 stock
 price
 plus
 dividends
 paid.
 In 2014,
 our
 total
 return
 to shareholders was
 6.8%.
 Consistent with
 BB&T™s
  
mission,
 our
 long-term
 returns
 exceeded
 our
 peers
 and
 have
 been
 the
 most
 consistent
 among
 our
 peers
 during
 the last
 10 years.
 BB&T™s
 20-year
 annualized
 return
 to shareholders
 has
 been
 10.9%,
 compared
 with
 the
 7.8%
 average
 of our
 peers.
 We also
 outperformed
 our
 peers
 and
 the
 S&P 500
 ˜nancials
 index
 over
 the
 last
 seven-year,
 10-year
 and
 15-year
 periods.
Predictable
 dividends
 are
 also
 very
 important
 to us.
 Nearly
 half
  
of our
 shareholders
 are
 individuals who
 have
 accumulated
 their
 shares
 over
 many years
 and
 depend
 on
 a steady
 stream
 of
 dividends.
 We are
 proud
 that
 BB&T
 has
 consistently
 had
 among
 the highest
 dividend
 yields
 and
 payout
 ratios,
 compared
 to
 our
 peers.
 BB&T
 has
 paid
 a
 cash
 dividend
 to shareholders
 every
 year
 since
 1903.
 In the ˜rst
 quarter
 of 2014,
 we increased
 our
 quarterly dividend
 to $0.24
 per
 share,
  
a 4.3%
 increase
 from
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 of 2013.
 We are
 committed
 to continue
 making
 predictability
 a priority
 at BB&T.

BB&T
 is one
 of the
 nation™s
 best

 Œ and

A bank™s
 capital
 levels,
 which basically
 measure
 how

 if

 are

 the

 We spent much

 positioning
 BB&T
 to
 increase
 its
 capital
 distribution
 when appropriate.
 We follow
 clear priorities
 in distributing
 capital.
 We focus
 on organic

 Regular

 are
 a strong
 second.
 Strategic
 opportunities
 such
 as mergers

 are
 third

 Our
 announced
 acquisition
 of Susquehanna

 in late
 2014,
 structured
 with
 30%

 represents

While

 instructive.
 By

We have focused intently on leadership at BB&T for many decades. 
To meet our vision of creating the best ˜nancial institution possible, 

we need the best possible leaders. But it is more than that. We believe 

leadership is also the driver of the growth and success for all BB&T™s 

constituents Œ our clients, associates, communities and shareholders. 

For our clients, the differentiator is not only who can provide the best 

products and services, but also how we can best help them as they 

lead and grow their businesses. For our associates, BB&T™s extensive 

leadership training programs are built around a simple but powerful 

mantra: ﬁIt™s not about us.ﬂ Rather, our mission is to make a positive, 

meaningful difference in the lives of as many people as possible. 

We believe if we can help make that difference Œ and help create 

better leaders Œ in communities throughout our marketplace, we all 

bene˜t. Our shareholders share in the growth made possible by our 
 collective leadership.
BB&T™s leadership model is based on a simple premise: people 
primarily behave in a manner that is consistent with their beliefs. 

We reject the quick and frequently misapplied solution of stronger 

and stronger demands to compel associates to behave in a certain 

way. Instead, we have learned that for people to change and perform 

better over the long term, they must believe what they are doing 
 is right. That is why the values we constantly stress to associates are 

so important Œ values like honesty, independent thinking, teamwork 

and pride in their work. When our behavior is anchored by our beliefs 

and values, we get the right results. In other words, beliefs drive 

behaviors, which create results.
Our model is also grounded in the power of positive thinking. 
Unfortunately, many people allow themselves to be consumed by 

the negatives of situations, caused in part by society setting limits 

on what we should not do and imposing penalties when we make 

a mistake. It takes a concerted effort to focus on the positive rather 

than the negative, on the opportunities rather than the obstacles. 
 To counteract that, our leadership model stresses the positives Œ 

positive reinforcement and an enthusiastic, positive attitude.
We believe so deeply in the importance of leadership that we 
have started sharing what we have learned more widely through 
 The BB&T Leadership Institute. We will continue our commitment 

to our associates with a program that has offered leadership 

development to thousands of associates over the last three 

decades. In 2014, we added three other audiences Œ our corporate 

clients, educators and students. The BB&T Leadership Institute 

has incorporated the closely aligned leadership philosophy of 
 Farr Associates, which has helped top U.S. companies with leadership 

development programs for more than a half century. This long-time 

BB&T subsidiary is now part of The BB&T Leadership Institute.
In addition to discussing banking staples like deposits, credit needs 

and treasury services, we are starting conversations with clients 

about how BB&T can help them attain their business goals in 

areas such as leadership development and succession planning. 
 Our approach begins with learning about a company™s strategic and 

tactical goals, so our work is closely aligned with achieving its most 

critical performance objectives. 
We have begun offering our time-tested, five-day ﬁMastering 
Leadership Dynamicsﬂ course to our corporate clients. Our program 

is based in part on greater awareness. We do not believe leaders 

can fully meet their potential until they understand themselves, 

their associates and their environment. For example, how do they 

react to different people and different situations? How do they act 

under stress? What are their emotional triggers? Virtually all (97%) 
 company executives who have completed the course say the self-

awareness experience prompted them to establish a clear path 
 to improve their leadership practices.
We also are reaching out to educators and students because our 
future leaders are sitting in classrooms today. After a successful pilot 

program in 2014, we will offer our unique leadership development 

program to several hundred school principals in 2015. Studies 

have shown principals have among the biggest impact on student 

achievement by creating an environment for learning. In addition, 

we are collaborating with universities across our footprint to develop 
 a leadership curriculum for their students. We also are expanding our 

outreach to high school and other students with ˜nancial literacy 

education through the BB&T Financial Foundation and our innovative 

ﬁLEGACY: A BB&T Leadership Challengeﬂ mobile gaming application 

that teaches leadership skills. We are looking for opportunities 

to reach young leaders wherever we find them. One example: 
 a leadership development program, including a new merit badge, 
 for a Girl Scout council in North Carolina.
BB&T™s leadership initiative is not intended to gain recognition 
 or promote our products, although our clients regularly tell us how 
much they value our focus on an area that is typically not discussed 

by their other business partners. Rather, our commitment to 

leadership development is a crucial part of our mission to help our 

clients, associates, communities and shareholders succeed, thereby 

making the world a better place to live. If we can help create better 

leaders, our marketplaces, our capitalistic system and our country 

will prosper.

Each year BB&T™s senior management team sets our strategic 
objectives. Our tactics may change, but BB&T has not veered from 

our primary strategies in recent years Œ a re˜ection of our consistency 

of purpose and commitment to our vision of creating the best 

˚nancial institution possible.
We always start with a clear-eyed analysis of the challenges 
 to achieving our objectives. The global economic and geopolitical 
environment remains volatile, with a succession of crises ranging 

from the ISIS terrorist threat, the Ebola outbreak and cybersecurity 

breaches to economic worries in China, Japan and much of Europe. 

In many ways, the U.S. is doing better than the rest of the world, but 

that uncertainty ˚lters down to our country and industry, restraining 

the con˚dence of our clients. CEOs constantly tell me they are still 

hesitant about investing. The good news is the tremendous pent-up 

demand in our economy following the long recession. We believe 

business and consumer con˚dence will gradually improve in 2015 

with a strengthening U.S. economy and hopefully continued signs 
 of change in Washington. 
In the banking industry, one worrisome sign is intensifying competition 
in commercial lending, forcing down prices and prompting some 

banks to take on excessive credit risk. We have not, and will not, 

lower BB&T™s credit standards, but we are concerned that some in 

our industry have forgotten lessons we should have learned from 

the recession. We also are concerned about the growing in˜uence 
 of nonbank companies, particularly in the payments industry. While 

we do not object to the competition Œ and indeed aggressively 

support the trend toward mobile payments Œ we believe nonbank 

participants should be subject to the same regulations as big U.S. 

banks, in part because of their vulnerability to computer hackers 
 or even terrorist threats.
We view the consolidation of our industry as a huge opportunity for 
BB&T. We have never had a goal to reach a certain size, but we are 
 a growth organization because that is how we optimize the long-term 

return to our shareholders, the opportunities for our associates and 

the health of our communities. We focus primarily on organic growth, 

but believe we can supplement that in a year™s period by growing 5% 
 to 10% of our asset size through acquisitions. Our disciplined 

approach to acquisitions imposes three tests: the transaction must 

make strategic sense, create a good cultural ˚t and provide long-term 

shareholder value. 
As you will see in the following sections, we are very positive about 
the future of our business because all of our key strategies are 

working well Œ for the bene˚t of our clients, associates, communities 
 and shareholders.
Deliver the BB&T Value Promise Enterprise-wide 
 and Across All Delivery Channels, Thereby Creating 
 the Perfect Client Experience
Our overarching long-term strategy is to provide the best value 
proposition in the marketplace by offering the best quality service. 

Whether in banking or any other business, we believe people 

ultimately move to the best value, based on quality over price.
Our community banks have long been the locomotive of our banking 
operation and a big reason for our success in delivering the Perfect 

Client Experience Œ service that is reliable, responsive, empathetic and 

competent. Our community bankers have the autonomy to make 

most decisions locally. At the same time, as the nation™s 10th largest 

bank by deposits, we can offer our clients a diverse menu of banking 

and nonbanking services. We are partners and consultative, trusted 

advisors who create deep relationships with our clients, not order 

takers or salespeople. So we talk less about ourselves and our products, 

and more about what we can do to help our clients be successful.
In an increasingly online world, many more of our clients want to 
do their banking digitally. A cross-divisional team of senior BB&T 

managers is focused on redesigning our retail delivery, leveraging digital 

technology to serve our clients more ef˚ciently. We are committed to 

creating a seamless client experience that is easier, simpler, faster, more 

personal and more secure, regardless of how the service is delivered. 

We see mobile banking and other electronic channels as complements 

to the experience in our branches, and vice versa. While many 

clients prefer our mobile banking services for routine transactions, 

for example, we recognize that clients still want to deal with people 
 for advice and more complex transactions. What is 
not
 changing is the 
responsiveness and consultative approach of our community banking 

model. That remains at the core of BB&T™s value promise. 
We are proud that our superior service quality has been consistently 
af˚rmed by independent sources for both our retail and commercial 

operations. Since 2009, Greenwich Associates has presented BB&T™s 

small business and middle market banking groups 103 excellence awards 

Œmore than any other bank. Keynote has ranked BB&T™s retail banking

website ˚rst in all four customer experience categories. For the third year 

in a row, BB&T Wealth was named one of the ﬁTop 40 Wealth Managersﬂ 

by 
Barron™s
 magazine. For the last 13 years, 
Training
 magazine has named 
BB&T a top-ranked bank for our associate training program. 
As a testament to our consistency, consider this ad for BB&T, placed 
100 years ago: ﬁSelect a bank with a heart and soul, not a ˚nancial 

institution that simply considers its own strength. Choose a bank that 

can most readily pay out money and extend help by giving honest 

advice.ﬂ It was the simple truth then and still is today.
OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
43872_Text.indd   123/2/15   2:49 PM13
Annual Report
™14
Ensure
 a Strong
 Associate
 Value
 Proposition
We are
 committed
 to creating
 a place
 where
 our
 associates
 can
 learn,
 grow
 and
 be ful˜lled
 in their
 work.
 This
 associate
 value
 proposition
  
is directly
 related
 to our
 value
 promise
 to clients.
 We deliver
 superior
 service
 quality
 because
 engaged
 associates
 come
 in
 every
 morning
 focused
 on helping
 our
 clients
 be successful.
 We start with
 a strong
 package
 of health
 and
 wellness,
 education,
 vacation
 and
 other
 associate
 benefits.
 BB&T
 is one
 of
 the
 few
 companies
 that
 offers
 both a
 pension
 program
 and
 an employer-
matched
 401k
 retirement
 plan.
 Our
 bene˜ts
 help
 ensure
 stability:
 BB&T™s
 turnover
 rate
 is one
 of the lowest
 in the industry.
 If our
 associates
 feel
 positive
 about
 achieving their
 own
 ˜nancial
 security,
 they
 can
 focus
 on helping
 our
 clients
 do
 the
 same.
 When
 I talk
 to BB&T
 leaders,
 I tell
 them
 their
 ˜rst
 job
 every
 day
 is to see
 how
 their
 associates
 are doing.
 Do they
 have
 any
 challenges
 in business?
 How
 are
 things
 going
 at home?
 What
 can
 we do to help
 you
 be more
 successful
 and
 happy,
 both
 at work
 and
 away
 from
 work?
 Some may say
 leaders
 should
 stick
 to workplace
 issues.
 We disagree.
 Happiness
 is foremost
 among
 the
 fundamental
 values
 that
 form
 the foundation
 of everything
 we do at BB&T.
 We focus
 with
 our
 associates
 on
 trying
 to achieve
 a level
 of happiness
 in business
 and
 in
 life,
 because
 that
 leads
 to
 a
 sense of
 self-esteem,
 pride
 in
 what
 we have
 accomplished,
 and
 a belief
 that we
 are doing
 something
 worthwhile
 Œ that
 we make
 a difference.
 We also
 believe
 helping
 our
 communities
 is directly
 related
 to
 achieving
 our
 vision
 of creating
 the
 best
 ˜nancial
 institution
 possible.
 The
 sum of the
 assets
 and
 liabilities
 in the
 community
 becomes
 the
 net
 worth
 of the
 bank.
 Our
 communities
 have
 served
 us very
 well
 for
 143
 years;
 we
 have
 an
 obligation
 to
 give
 back
 what
 we have
 received.
 When
 our
 communities
 were
 struggling
 during
 the last
 recession,
  
we launched
 Project
 Lighthouse,
 giving
 our
 associates
 time
 off
 work
 with
 BB&T
 ˜nancial
 support,
 to volunteer
 time
 on community
 projects
 such
 as helping
 to alleviate
 homelessness. Hundreds
 of our
 associates
 have
 told
 me, with
 tears
 in their
 eyes,
 how
 much
 better
 they
 feel
 about
 BB&T,
 and
 themselves,
 because
 of their
 work
 on Project
 Lighthouse.
 It all
 ties
 together.
 When
 associates feel
 they
 are
 part
 of
 their communities,
 it
 raises
 their
 self-esteem
 and
 makes
 them
 more
 engaged
 in serving
 our
 clients.
 Our
 value
 proposition
 is not
 only
 about
 delivering
 value
 to
 our
 clients.
 It
 is
 about
 living
 our
 values
  
in everything
 we do.
Drive
 Revenue
 Growth
 in a Very
 Challenging
 Environment
  
Both
 Organically
 and
 Through
 Strategic
 Opportunities
 Diversi˜cation
 is the driver
 of BB&T™s
 revenue
 growth,
 which
 in turn
 produces
 our
 stable
 and
 growing
 returns
 to our
 shareholders.
 BB&T™s
 diversi˜cation
 extends
 to our
 markets,
 products
 and
 loan
 portfolios.
 Geographically,
 the
 steady
 growth
 of our
 primary
 Southeast
 and
 Mid-Atlantic
 markets
 is balanced,
 for
 example,
 with
 the robust
 growth
 of newer
 markets
 in Texas
 and
 Florida.
 In Texas,
 our
 acquisition
 of a total
 of 62 Citibank
 branches
 in 2014
 significantly
 advances
 our
 multi-faceted
 strategy
 in one
 of the nation™s
 fastest-growing
 states.
 We have
 rapidly
 expanded
 our
 market
 share
 in
 six
 years
 by immediately
 tapping
 into
 the
 vibrant
 Texas
 commercial
 banking
 opportunities
 with
 new
 commercially
 focused
 branches
 while
 pursuing
 a longer-term
 strategy of
 creating
 a balanced
 retail/commercial franchise
 in key
 Texas
 markets.
 We are anticipating more
 rapid
 growth
 from
 that
 base,
  
primarily
 organically.

With our pending acquisition of The Bank of Kentucky, we will nearly 
double our statewide deposits, increase our market share from fourth 

to second and add new markets in Kentucky™s ﬁGolden Triangleﬂ 

between Lexington, Louisville and northern Kentucky. Signi˜cantly, 

we also will gain access to contiguous Cincinnati and Ohio and 
 the many manufacturing and industrial companies in those markets.
Greater diversification is also a principal benefit of the planned 
Susquehanna acquisition. We will significantly expand our 
 Mid-Atlantic footprint by adding other attractive contiguous markets. 

The acquisition will add 245 retail branches with approximately $13.6 

billion in deposits and $18.6 billion in assets. BB&T™s wealth business 

will gain access to 12 of Pennsylvania™s 20 most af˚uent counties. 
 Our experienced energy team will form relationships in the large 

energy sector in Pennsylvania, the nation™s third-largest producer 

of natural gas. We will bolster our market share in the Maryland 

and Delaware Valley markets, with their rich base of world-leading 

education, healthcare and research institutions. After spending time 

with many Susquehanna associates, clients and leaders in their 

communities, I am even more excited about our common culture and 

vision than when we announced the acquisition in November 2014.
Our community bank, representing just under half of our revenue, 
 is balanced with a diverse mix of fee-income businesses. These 
national businesses diversify our balance sheet with non-real 

estate and low-cost deposits, bolster our margins and sustain our 

pro˜tability during slower economic cycles.
BB&T™s national Capital Markets Corporate Banking group is 
increasingly important to our balance sheet and earnings growth. It 

provides diversi˜cation three ways Œ in our commercial and industrial 

loan portfolio, geographically, and by diversifying risk through 
specialization in sectors such as energy, nonpro˜t senior living, and 

food, beverage and agribusiness. Since 2011, our total commitments 

have expanded by 25% to $24 billion, with more than 70% of annual 

new-money loan production coming from new markets and new 

industry coverage. A key to our success has been to put experienced 

corporate bankers in markets throughout BB&T™s franchise and 

nationally. We now have loan production offices in Chicago, 

Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Louisville, New York and 
 San Francisco. In 2014, we based a new corporate banking team in 

New York City to focus on developing new relationships and providing 

strategic ˜nancial advice to corporate and institutional clients in the 

Northeast. With a full complement of equity, debt, sales distribution, 

research, merger and acquisition and advisory capabilities Œ breadth 

few regional banks can match Œ BB&T is well positioned as corporate 

America expands investment in an improving economy. At the same 

time, we are expanding our retail reach with our fast-growing wealth 

business, which received 25,000 referrals from our community bank 

in 2014, and BB&T Scott & Stringfellow brokerage, which added 
 28 ˜nancial advisors. 
Insurance, a core BB&T business founded in 1922, is the biggest 
contributor to a diversi˜ed revenue stream, increasing its contribution 

to 18% in 2014 from 12% in 2005. In 2014, we expanded our 

presence on the Carolina coasts with the acquisition of Woodbury 

& Co. and our coverage of the aviation industry with our acquisition 

of Caledonian Insurance Group Inc. Insurance balances our interest-

rate-sensitive lending business, providing a stable revenue source 

resilient in all business cycles. Within the insurance segment, 

we are diversified between wholesale and retail and across 

all insurance types. From our clients™ perspective, insurance 

products are a key complement to needed financial services,

opening
 doors
 to
 our
 bankers
 in all
 segments
 as a lead-in
 product
  
to create new relationships.
 We see
 many
 opportunities
 ahead.
 One
 example:
 Our
 AmRisc
 subsidiary,
 which
 insures
 property
 against
 wind-related
 catastrophes,
 has
 been
 invited
 by the state of
 Florida
  
to exclusively
 write
 commercial
 condominium
 coverage.
Our
 specialized
 lending
 businesses
 add
 more
 geographic
 and
 revenue
 diversi˜cation
 because
 they
 are
 nationwide,
 are
 not
 linked
 to real
 estate
 and
 are
 primarily
 either consumer
 or small business
 ˜nance.
 We have
 developed
 or acquired
 the businesses
 to provide
 additional
 products
 and
 services
 to our
 clients.
 Most
 businesses
 operate independently
 with
 a strong
 client
 base.
 Our
 specialized
 lending
 associates
 often
 are
 located
 alongside
 our community
 and
 corporate bankers,
 creating
 cross-selling
 opportunities
 for
 our
 associates
 and
 one-stop
 shopping
 for
 our
 clients.
 For
 example,
 we often
 provide
 insurance
 premium
 ˜nance
 to our
 commercial
 insurance
 clients
 from
 AFCO/CAFO
 Prime
 Rate,
 one
 of the
 largest
 insurance
 premium
 ˜nance
 companies
 in the
 U.S.
 and
 Canada.
 All of our
 specialized
 lending
 adheres
 to BB&T™s
 strict
 credit
 quality
 standards.
 Regional
 Acceptance
 Corporation,
 for
 instance,
 remains
 very
 selective
 as
 a
 subprime
 lender
 in
 auto
 ˜nance, booking
 only
 about
 5% of applications.
 We typically
 do not
 convert
 traditional
 bankers
 into
 specialist
 roles.
 We recruit
 only
 the
 top
 specialists
 in their
 disciplines,
 with an
 average
 of 20-plus
 years
 of experience.
Continue
 Efforts
 to Optimize
 BB&T™s
 Risk
 Governance
 Framework,
 Including
 Capital
 and
 Liquidity
 Management,
 Positioning
 the
 Organization
 for
 Strategic
 Opportunities
 Our
 intent
 with
 BB&T™s
 risk
 governance framework,
 as it is with
 every
 strategy,
 is to align
 our
 risk
 management
 with
 our
 vision, mission
 and
 values.
 Thus,
 we position
 ourselves
 from
 a risk standpoint
 for
 sustainable,
 resilient
 performance
 with
 less
 earnings
 variability
 and
 stable
 returns
 through
 all business
 conditions.
 We start with
 a conservative
 risk
 culture
 that has
 served
 us well
 during
 even
 the
 toughest
 economic
 cycles,
 including
 the
 most
 recent
 recession
 when
 BB&T
 was
 one
 of the
 few
 banks
 to remain
 pro˜table.
 But we
 recognize
 we must
 build
 on that
 solid
 credit
 foundation
 as
 BB&T
 gets
 bigger
 amid
 a zero-tolerance
 regulatory
 environment.
 Over
 the
 last
 two
 years,
 we have
 made
 enormous
 investments
 in people,
 systems
 and
 processes
 to build
 an integrated,
 comprehensive
 risk
 governance
 framework,
 including
 capital
 and
 liquidity
 management.
 Our new
 Enterprise
 Resource
 Planning
 system
 leapfrogs
 existing
 peer
 technologies
 and
 signi˜cantly
 reduces risk
 by providing
 consistent,
 reliable
 and
 reconcilable
 data
 and
 ˚exible,
 rapid
 reaction
 to upcoming
 regulatory
 changes, among
 many
 other
 capabilities.
 We
 stress
 role
 clarity
 and
 accountability
 at every level
 of the company.
 Every
 associate
 shares
 responsibility
 for
 some
 aspect
 of
 risk
 management,
 whether
 in a first-line
 business
 unit,
 in the risk
 organization
  
or elsewhere
 in the
 company.

 In addition
 to constantly replacing
 their

 to our
 shareholders:
 building
 an integrated,
 comprehensive
 risk
 governance
 and
 capital
 management
 framework.
 Our
 more
 robust
 program
 allows
 us to more
 efficiently
 and
 effectively
 analyze
 risk,
 determine
 our
 capital
 adequacy
 and
 evaluate
 how
 we will
 perform
 in the
 ﬁstress
 testsﬂ
 used
 by regulators
 to gauge
 how
 banks
 fare
 under
 multiple
 economic
 scenarios.
 In turn,
 our
 tremendous
 strides
 in those
 areas
 allow
 us to deploy
 our
 capital
 for
 vital
 purposes,
 including
 increasing
 our
 dividends
 and
 making
 the
 strategic
 investments
 essential
 to our
 growth.
 None
 of
 this
 would
 have
 been
 possible
 without
 the
 relentless
 efforts
 of cross-functional
 teams
 who
 met
 demanding
 deadlines
 developing,
 testing
 and
 reviewing
 our
 improved
 processes.
 Their
 work
 gives
 us a competitive
 advantage
 over our
 peers and
 supports
 BB&T™s
 long-term
 growth
 for
 the
 bene˜t
 of
 our
 shareholders.

43872_Text.indd   173/2/15   2:52 PM18Annual Report
™14
Our framework is governed by very strict limits with rigorous 
inspection, whether on single-name exposures or portfolio 

concentrations, and we don™t make exceptions. For example, we do 

not participate in high-risk ventures like leveraged lending. Quite 

simply, if we don™t fully understand the risk, we don™t feel we can 

manage it, and we don™t participate. That does not mean we avoid 

risk; our strategy is to identify those areas where the risk is predictable 

and where we can be compensated for assuming it. So we focus 

on ˜nding those businesses with the least amount of risk and the 

highest return opportunity with the least variability. One example: 

Shef˜eld Financial, BB&T™s direct installment lender in power and 

sports equipment, with both strong credit quality and loan growth. 
A key lesson of the recession is the danger of too much concentration. 
Our five-year diversification plan has reduced exposure to more 

volatile real estate and increased our focus on more stable 

commercial and industrial and consumer loans, while also improving 

the mix of our deposit structure. 
One clear benefit of all our hard work in enhancing our risk 
governance framework is the operational freedom to act on 

strategic opportunities Œ a crucial advantage in today™s regulatory 

environment when any gaps or de˜ciencies in a bank™s risk system 

can quickly shut down strategic initiatives such as acquisitions. 

Of course, every bank claims to control risk. For an independent 

evaluation, we asked a leading consultant for exhaustive examination 

of BB&T™s risk culture. The results: BB&T outperformed our peers on 

nine out of 10 key cultural parameters. ﬁBB&T™s risk culture, which 

is strongly conservative, in˚uences the entire bank positively and 

signi˜cantly,ﬂ the consultant wrote.
Aggressively Control Expenses While Optimizing Our 
 Cost Structure by Reconceptualizing and Enhancing 
 the Effectiveness of Our Businesses
Our approach to increasing our efficiency and controlling our 
expenses underscores two of our fundamental beliefs at BB&T: 
 We must think long term in setting our strategies, and we must be 

laser focused every day in executing those strategies.
We have made very substantial, strategic investments in our people, 
processes and systems over the last two years to become more 

ef˜cient in an environment of increasing competition and regulatory 

requirements. Investments in general ledger and commercial loan 

systems, for example, will allow us to significantly increase our 

cost savings and maximize our referrals and cross-selling revenue. 
 Of course, investing in infrastructure increases costs over the short-

term. The good news is those higher expenses are largely behind us 

as we enter 2015 and, more importantly, we will begin to see the 

long-term bene˜ts in greater ef˜ciency.
At the same time, we have been focused on executing our strategy 
by continuing to be brutally intense in controlling expenses, including 

closing suboptimal branches. We recognize that we cannot control 

some expenses, such as higher regulatory costs. Rather, we believe 

limiting expenses we can control must be a permanent mindset 

of every associate, every day, in every area of BB&T. We also are 

aggressively reconceptualizing and restructuring our businesses 
 to operate more ef˜ciently. Just as a top-down approach to layoffs 

is rarely effective, we do not mandate how our businesses are 

redesigned; we challenge and empower our associates closest to the 

business to show us a better way.

Our
 long-term
 adherence
 to our
 culture,
 vision,
 mission
 and
 values
  
is a shared
 commitment
 that has
 set
 BB&T
 apart
 for
 143
 years.
 I would
 like
 to express
 my deep
 appreciation
 to our
 talented
 executive
 management
 team,
 who
 lead
 that
 steadfast
 commitment
 every
 day.
 The
 team
 is relatively
 young
 in age,
 with an
 average
 age
 of 56.
 But
 it is very
 deep
 in experience, with an
 average
 of 30
 years
 with
 BB&T,
 typically
 starting in
 our
 leadership
 development
 program.
 The
 guidance
 of BB&T™s
 strong
 board
 of directors
 also
 has
 been
 crucial
 in helping
 me and
 our
 leadership
 team steer
 a steady
 course
 in a challenging,
 rapidly
 changing
 environment.
 We are
 excited
 that
 Susquehanna
 Chairman
 and
 CEO
 William
 J. Reuter
 and
 Susquehanna
 board
 member
 Christine
 Sears
 will
 join
 the
 BB&T
 board
 upon
 closing
 of that
 transaction.
I am also
 indebted
 to every
 BB&T
 associate
 who shares the
 commitment
 to do our
 best
 for
 our
 clients
 as much
 as I
 do as CEO.
 During
 a talk
 to 500 Rotarians
 recently,
 a gentleman
 asked
 me to give
 one
 reason
 why
 he should
 bank
 with
 BB&T.
 My answer:
 Because
 our
 associates
 get
 up every
 morning
 focused
 on how
 we can
 help
  
our
 clients
 be more
 successful.
Consider
 the
 words
 of
 just
 one
 associate,
 Dontá
 Wilson,
 president
 of BB&T™s
 Atlanta-based
 Northern
 Georgia
 region,
 in a recent
 interview:
 ﬁFor
 me, being
 a banker
 is not
 a job
 or a career.
 It™s
 a calling
 to do
 meaningful,
 impactful,
 purposeful
 work–.
 Bankers
 do
 the
 noble
 work
 of
 caring
 for
 and
 educating
 our
 fellow
 neighbors
 so
 that
  
we can
 change
 our
 neighbors™ ˜nancial
 trajectory
 and
 give
 them an
 opportunity
 to achieve
 economic
 success
 and
 ˜nancial
 security.ﬂ
 His
 words
 underscore
 why
 our
 common
 culture
 is
 so powerful,
  
and
 what
 makes
 me
 proud
 of all
 of our
 associates
 and
 con˜dent
 about
 our future.
The
 naysayers say
 the
 U.S.
 has
 seen
 its
 best
 days
 and
 focus
 on our
 industry™s
 dif˜culties.
 We
 absolutely
 reject
 that.
 The
 U.S.
 capitalistic
 system
 is the greatest
 economic
 engine
 in the world.
 At BB&T,
 we know
 each
 day
 will
 bring challenges
 and
 opportunities.
 We confront
 the
 challenges
 but
 don™t
 obsess
 over
 them.
 We look
 for
 the
 potential,
 rather
 than
 the
 ˚aws,
 so we can
 identify
 and
 take
 advantage
 of all
 the
 opportunities.
 We maintain
 an enthusiastic,
 positive
 attitude.
 Despite
 a challenging
 regulatory
 and
 business
 environment,
 BB&T
  
is well
 positioned
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 our
 opportunities
 and
 leverage
 our
 strengths,
 ultimately
 achieving
 our
 long-term
 purpose
 of rewarding
 our
 shareholders
 for
 their
 investments.
 Our
 opportunities
 are
 enormous.
 We
 have
 outstanding
 core
 markets,
 with
 expansion
 opportunities
 when
 they
 arise
 and
 make
 sense.
 We have
 outstanding
 products
 and
 services.
 We
 have
 an
 outstanding
 leadership
 team,
 board
 of directors
 and
 associates.
 With
 a shared commitment
  
to growth,
 leadership,
 our culture
 and
 the
 success
 of our
 clients,
 and
 with
 your
 continuing
 support,
 I am con˜dent
 that
 BB&T™s
 best
 days
 are
 ahead.

 BB&T operates in markets that have a diverse employment base covering numerous industries. Management strongly 
believes that BB&T™s community bank approach to providing client service is a competitive advantage that strengthens the 
Company™s ability to effectively provide financial products and 
services to businesses and individuals in its markets. 
Furthermore, BB&T believes its current market area will su
pport growth in assets and deposits in the future. 
     
9  Competition
  The financial services industry is highly competitive and constantly evolving. BB&T™s subsidiaries compete actively with 

national, regional and local financial servic
es providers, including banks, thrifts, 
securities dealers, mortgage bankers, fina
nce companies and insurance companies. In recent years, compe
tition has increased from institutions not subject to the same 
regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and BHCs. Consumers have the opportunity to select from a variety of traditional 

and nontraditional alternatives. The industry frequently sees me
rger activity, which affects competition by eliminating some 
regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers. For additional information concerning 

markets, BB&T™s competitive position and business strategies 
and recent government interventions, see ﬁMarket Areaﬂ 
above and ﬁGeneral Business Developmentﬂ below. 
 General Business Development  
 BB&T is a regional FHC and has maintained a long-term focus 
on a strategy that includes
 expansion of asset size and 
diversification in terms of revenues and sources of profita
bility. This strategy encompasses both organic growth and 
acquisitions of complementary banks and financial businesses. 
 
Merger and Acquisition Strategy 
  
BB&T™s growth in business, profitability and market share ha
s historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and 
acquisitions. Management intends to remain disciplined and focused with regard to future merger and acquisition 
opportunities. BB&T will continue to assess bank and thrift acq
uisitions subject to market conditions, primarily within or 
contiguous to BB&T™s existing footprint, and will pursue economically advantageous acquisitions of insurance agencies, 
specialized lending businesses, and fee income generating fi
nancial services businesses. BB&T™s strategy is currently 
focused on meeting the following three acquisition criteria:  

  must be strategically attractive Œ meaning that any bank 
acquisition should be in BB&T™s existing footprint to allow 
for cost savings and economies of scale or in contiguous states to provide market diversification, or the transaction 

must be otherwise strategically compelling;  
  any risk-related issues would need 
to be quantified and addressed; and 
  the transaction must meet BB&T™s financial criteria. 
 During 2014, BB&T completed the 
purchase of 21 bank branches in Texas, 
providing $1.2 billion in deposits. BB&T reached 
an agreement and obtained regulatory approval to acquire 41 additional retail branches in Texas with approximately $2.3 

billion in deposits.  

 BB&T also reached agreements to acquire 
The Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation, which has $1.9 billion in assets, 
$1.6 billion in deposits and 32 branches with a strong ma
rket share in the northern Kentucky/Cincinnati market, and 
Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., which has $18.7 billion in assets, 
$13.7 billion in deposits and 245 branches in Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, New Jersey, and West Virginia
 (balances as of December 31, 2014). 
 Regulatory Considerations 
  The following discussion describes elements
 of an extensive regulatory framework 
applicable to BHCs, FHCs and banks and 
contains specific information about BB&T. Regulation of banks, BHCs and FHCs is intended primarily for the protection of 

depositors, the DIF and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. As
 described in more detail below, comprehensive reform of the le
gislative and regulatory landscape occurred with the passage 
of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2014. 

In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agen
cies, BB&T is subject to various other laws, regulations, 
supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and 
management of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. 
     
10 
 BB&T™s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in state and federal laws and 
regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including
 those referred to in this section. Proposals to change the
 laws and regulations to which BB&T is subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood 
and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on BB&T is impossible to determine with any 
certainty. The description herein summarizes the significant stat
e and federal laws to which BB&T currently is subject. To 
the extent statutory or regulatory provisions are described in 
this section, such descriptions
 are qualified in their entirety 
by 
reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions. 
 Financial Regulatory Reform  
 During the past several years, there has been a significant in
crease in regulation and regulatory
 oversight for U.S. financial 
services firms, primarily resulting from the Dodd-Frank 
Act. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive, complicated and 
comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization, representing a significant overhaul o
f many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching 

changes that affect financial companies, incl
uding banks, BHCs and FHCs such as BB&T.  
 Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation 

by the applicable federal regulators. BB&T will continue to evaluate the impact of any new regulations so promulgated, 
including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB and 
the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others. 

 As a BHC and a FHC under federal law, BB&T is subject to 
regulation under the BHCA and the examination and reporting 
requirements of the FRB. Branch Bank
, a North Carolina state-ch
artered commercial bank, is subject to regulation, 
supervision and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC and the CFPB. 

 State and federal law govern the activities in which Branch Bank
 engages, the investments it makes and the aggregate amount 
of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various cons
umer and compliance laws and 
regulations also affect its 
operations. Branch Bank also is affected by the actions of the FRB as it implements monetary policy.  

 
In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including 
those that engage in securities underwritin
g, dealing, brokerage, investment adviso
ry and insurance activities, are subject to 
other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies 

and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, 
NYSE and various state insurance and securities regulators. 
 FHC Regulation  
 
Under current federal law, as a BHC, BB&
T has elected to become a FHC, which a
llows it to offer customers virtually any 
type of service that is financial in na
ture or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related thereto, 
securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) an
d merchant banking. In order to maintain its status as a 
FHC, BB&T and all of its affiliated depo
sitory institutions must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a 
satisfactory CRA rating. The FRB has responsibility for overs
eeing compliance with these requirements and monitoring FHC 
status. If the FRB determines that a FHC is not well-capitalized
 or well-managed, the FHC has a period of time to comply, 
but during the period of noncompliance,
 the FRB can place any limitations on the 
FHC that it believes to be appropriate. 
Furthermore, if the FRB determines that a FHC has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be able to 
commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the FHC would still be 
allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and ma
ke investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking 
activities.  
 Most of the financial activities that are permissible for FHCs al
so are permissible for a bank™s ﬁfinancial subsidiary,ﬂ except
 for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investme
nts, real estate investments and development, and merchant 
banking, which must be conducted by a FHC. In order for a financial subsidiary of a bank to engage in permissible financial 

activities, federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister
-bank affiliates) to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the 
aggregate consolidated assets of all of th
at bank™s financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated
 total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest
 national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements. 
     
11 
 Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which the FRB is the umbrella regulator for 
BHCs, but BHC affiliates are principally regulated by functiona
l regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank 
affiliates, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insuran
ce regulators for insurance affiliates. Certain specific activit
ies, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a 

ﬁbrokerﬂ or a ﬁdealerﬂ in securities for purposes of functiona
l regulation. Although states generally must regulate bank 
insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate 
bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes new prudential regulation on depository institutions and their holding companies. As such, 

BB&T is subject to more stringent standards and requiremen
ts with respect to (1) bank and nonbank acquisitions and 
mergers, (2) the ﬁfinancial activitiesﬂ in which it engages as a 
FHC, (3) affiliate transactions and (4) proprietary trading, 
among other provisions. 
 Enhanced Supervision Standards for Systemically Important Financial Institutions 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to monitor emerging risks 
to financial stability and establish enhanced supervision and 
prudential standards applicable to large, interconnected financial institutions, including BHCs like BB&T, with total 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (often referred to 
as systemically important financ
ial institutions). During Februar
y 2014, the FRB published the final rule implementing the enha
nced prudential standards required to be established under 
section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The enhanced prudential st
andards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, 
liquidity standards, risk management and risk committee requirements, stress test requirements and a debt-to-equity limit for 
companies that the Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability were they to fail such limits.  
 
Resolution Planning and Regulation QQ 
 
FRB and FDIC regulations requi
re ﬁcovered companiesﬂ such as BB&T and sy
stemically important financial institutions 
such as Branch Bank to file, maintain and update plans for a 
rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial 
distress or failure (a ﬁliving willﬂ). Both the FRB and the FD
IC must review and approve BB&T™s and Branch Bank™s living 
wills and are authorized to impose restrictions on BB&T™s and Branch 
Bank™s growth and activities or operations if deemed 
necessary. The public portions of BB&T™s and Branch Bank™s 
resolution plans are available in the Additional Disclosures 
section of the Investor Relations site at www.bbt.com.  
 CCAR and Stress Test Requirements 
 Current FRB rules require BB&T and other 
BHCs with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets to submit annual 
capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios. BB&T and othe
r such BHCs are also required 
to collect and report certain 
related data on a quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor the companies™ progress against their annual capital plans. 

Covered BHCs, including BB&T, may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has 
been reviewed by the FRB and as to which the FRB has not ob
jected. The rules also require, among other things, that a 
covered BHC may not make a capital distribution unless, after gi
ving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum 
regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of Basel I Tier 1 co
mmon capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 5%. In addition
, effective January 1, 2015, BB&T must maintain a Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 4.5%. See Table 3 for 
additional information about Basel III requirements. The FRB 
did not object to BB&T™s 2014 capital plan. The 2015 capital 
plan was submitted during January 2015.  
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to conduct an annual su
pervisory stress test for BHCs, such as BB&T, with $50 
billion or more of total consolidated assets. The FRB™s stress test rules also require that 
BB&T (as well as other covered 
BHCs) conduct a separate mid-year stress test, file the results 
of such test with the FRB and publicly disclose details of the 
scenario and the impact on its capital. BB&T™s annual and mi
dcycle stress test results are available in the Additional 
Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site on 
www.bbt.com
.  
During October 2014, the FRB adopted a rule that amends the capita
l plan and stress test rules to modify the start date of the 
capital plan and stress test cycles
 from October 1 to January 1 of the following calendar year. This rule is effective for 2015
. The rule also amends the capital plan rule to limit a BHC™s 
ability to make capital distributions to the extent the BHC™s actua
l capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its ca
pital plan under baseline conditi
ons, measured on a quarterly 
basis.  
     
12 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC
 to conduct an annual supervisory stress test for FDIC-insured state nonmember 
banks such as Branch Bank with $50 billion or more of total 
consolidated assets and requires such institutions to conduct 
annual company-run stress tests. The results of the annual supe
rvisory stress test are included in the annual capital plan 
submitted to the FDIC.  
 The FDIC published rulemaking that revises FDIC rules and regulations regarding the annual stress testing requirements for 

state non-member banks and state savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. FDIC 
regulations, which implement section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank
 Act, require covered banks to conduct annual stress tests 
and report the results of such stress tests to the FDIC and the FRB and publicly disclose a summary of the results of the 
required stress tests. The FDIC modified the ﬁas-ofﬂ dates fo
r financial data that covered banks will use to perform their 
stress tests as well as the reporting dates and public disclosure
 dates of the annual stress tests. The revisions to the regula
tions 
will become effective January 1, 2016. 
 Acquisitions  
 BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquis
ition activity. Under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or 
indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the 
voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or 
bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the FRB.  

 Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of bank
s and BHCs without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank 
headquartered in one stat
e is authorized to merge with a bank headquarter
ed in another state, subject to market share 
limitations and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of 

time. After a bank has established branches in a state through 
an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and 
acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a 
bank headquartered in that state could have established or 
acquired branches under applicable federal 
or state law. These regulatory consideratio
ns are applicable to privately negotiated
 acquisition transactions.  

 During 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement sect
ion 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits a 
financial company from combining with another company if the ratio of the resulting company's liabilities exceeds 10 percent 
of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.  
 Other Safety and Soundness Regulations  
 
The FRB has enforcement powers 
over BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities 
that represent unsafe or unsound practices 
or constitute violations of law, rule, 
regulation, administrative order or written 
agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exer
cised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil 
money penalties or other actions. 

 There also are a number of obligations and restrictions impos
ed on BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries by 
federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce po
tential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository 
institutions and to the FDIC insurance fund in the event the depository institution is insolvent or is in danger of becoming 

insolvent. For example, under 
requirements of the FRB with respect to BHC 
operations, a BHC is required to serve as a 
source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository in
stitutions and to commit financial resources to support such 
institutions in circumstances where it might 
not do so otherwise. In 
addition, the ﬁcross-guaranteeﬂ provisions of federal law 
require IDIs under common control to reimburse the FDIC for an
y loss suffered or reasonably 
anticipated by the DIF as a 
result of the insolvency of commonly controlled IDIs or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to commonly controlled 
IDIs in danger of failure. The FDIC™s claim for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of 
shareholders of the IDI or its holding company but is subordin
ate to claims of depositors, s
ecured creditors and nonaffiliated 
holders of subordinated debt of the commonly controlled IDI. 
 Federal and state banking regulators also have broad enforcement powers over Branch Bank, including the power to impose 
fines and other civil and criminal penalties, 
and to appoint a receiver in order to cons
erve the assets of Branch Bank for the 
benefit of depositors and other creditors. The North Carolina Commissioner of Banks also has the authority to take 

possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such 

bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an 
unsafe or unsound condition to transact its busine
ss or has an impairment of its capital stock. 
     
13 
 Payment of Dividends; Capital Requirements  
 The Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from 
Branch Bank and its subsidiaries. The majority of the Parent 
Company™s revenue is from dividends paid by Branch Bank. Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the 
amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, BB&T and Branch Bank
 are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to 
the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain 
capital at or above regulatory 
minimums, and to remain ﬁwell-
capitalizedﬂ under the prompt corr
ective action regulations summari
zed elsewhere in this section.
 Federal banking regulators 
have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (1) the organization™s net income available 
to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of 

earnings retention appears consistent with
 the organization™s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
BB&T™s 2015 capital actions will depend on the 
FRB™s review of BB&T™s 2015 capital plan. 
 North Carolina law states that, provided a bank does not make
 distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable 
required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North Carolina may declare such distributions as

     The federal banking agencies, including the FRB and the FDIC, ar
e required to take ﬁprompt corr
ective actionﬂ in respect of 
depository institutions and their BHCs that do not meet mi
nimum capital requirements. The law establishes five capital 

categories for IDIs for this purpose: 
ﬁwell-capitalized,ﬂ ﬁadequately capitali
zed,ﬂ ﬁundercapitalized,ﬂ ﬁsignificantly 
undercapitalizedﬂ and ﬁcritically undercapitalized.ﬂ To be consid
ered ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ under these standards, an institution 
must maintain the ratios shown above and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a 

specific capital level for any capital measure. 

 Federal law also requires the bank regulatory agencies to im
plement systems for ﬁprompt corrective actionﬂ for institutions 
that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five ca
pital categories, with progressive
ly more severe restrictions 
on operations, management and capital dist
ributions according to the category in wh
ich an institution is placed. Additionally, 
failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to 
be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law further 
mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management, asset 

quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such 
standards. 

 In addition to the ﬁprompt corrective actionﬂ directives, failur
e to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization
 to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additi
onal substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, 
termination of deposit insurance by the 
FDIC and, under certain co
nditions, the appointment of 
a conservator or receiver. 
     
14 
 U.S. Implementation of Basel III 
 During 2013, the FRB published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking 

organizations known as Basel III. The rules substantially revise
 the risk-based capital requirements applicable to BHCs and 
depository institutions, including BB&T and Branch Bank, compared
 to the current U.S. risk-bas
ed capital rules. The rules 
define the components of capital and address other issues af
fecting banking institutions' regul
atory capital ratios. The rules 
also address risk weights and other issues affecting the de
nominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and 
replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived 
from Basel I capital accords of the BCBS, with a more risk-
sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach
 in the BCBS's 2004 ﬁBasel IIﬂ
 capital accords. The Basel III 
rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the D
odd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the 
federal banking agencies' rules. BB&T qualifies as a standardiz
ed approach banking organization and must comply with the 
new requirements beginning on January 1, 2015. Institutions with
 greater than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in foreign 
assets are considered advanced approach banking organizations, which requires a more conservative calculation of risk-

weighted assets.   

 The Basel III rules, among other things, (1) introduce a new capita
l measure referred to as comm
on equity Tier 1; (2) specify 
that Tier 1 capital consist of Tier 1 common equity and additi
onal Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements; 
(3) define Tier 1 common equity narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be 

made to Tier 1 common equity and not to the other components of capital; and (4) expand the scope of the 
deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. 

 The Basel III rules prescribe a standardized
 approach for risk weightings that expa
nd the risk-weighting categories from the 
current four Basel I-derived categories 
(0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larg
er and more risk-sensitive number of 
categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ra
nging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 
600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weig
hts for a variety of asset categ
ories. In addition, the rules 
provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repu
rchase-style transactions cleared
 through a qualifying central 
counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and 
eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 
 The Basel III rules revise the ﬁprompt corr
ective actionﬂ directives by establishing
 more conservative ratio levels for well-
capitalized status. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, all banks must hold additional capital, the 
capital conservation buffer (which is in the form of common e
quity), to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions,
 such as dividend payments, discretionary payments on Tier 1 instruments, share buybacks, and certain discretionary bonus 

payments to executive officers, including heads of major business lines and similar employees. The required amount of the 
capital conservation buffer will be phased-in annually through January 1, 2019. 

 During September 2014, the FDIC, FRB and OCC issued a final 
rule on the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR rule. 
Under the final rule, BB&T will be considered a ﬁmodified LCRﬂ holding company. BB&T would be subject to full LCR 

requirements if its operations were to fall under the ﬁinternationally activeﬂ rules, which would generally be triggered if 
BB&T™s assets were to increase above $250 billion. BB&T implemented balance sheet changes to support its compliance 
with the rule and to optimize its balance sheet based on the final rule. These actions included changing the mix of the 

investment portfolio to include more GNMA and U.S. Treasu
ry securities, which qualify as Level 1 under the rule, and 
changing its deposit mix to increase retail and commercial deposits. Based on management™s interpretation of the final rule, 

BB&T™s LCR was approximately 130% at December 31, 2014, co
mpared to the regulatory minimum of 90% that will be 
effective January 1, 2016, which puts BB&
T in full compliance with the rule. The regulatory minimum will increase to 100% 
on January 1, 2017. The final rule requires each financial in
stitution to have a method for determining ﬁoperational depositsﬂ 

as defined by the rule. The number above includes an estimate of operational deposits; however, BB&T continues to evaluate 

its method to identify and measure operational deposits.

Home Mortgage Disclosure (Regulation C) 
 
The CFPB published proposed amendments to Regulation C to implement changes to HMDA made by section 1094 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the CFPB 
proposed several changes to revise the tests for determining which financial 
institutions and housing-related credit tran
sactions are covered under HMDA. The CFPB
 also proposes to require financial 
institutions to report new data points identified in the Dodd-Fran
k Act, as well as other data points the CFPB believes may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of HMDA. Further, the CFPB proposes to better align the requirements of Regulation C 
to existing industry standards where practicable. To improve 
the quality and timeliness of HMDA data, the CFPB proposed 
to require financial institutions with large 
numbers of reported transactions to submit 
their HMDA data on a quarterly, rather 
than an annual, basis. 

 
Enhanced Prudential Standards for BHCs and Foreign Banking 
 
The FRB has adopted amendments to Regulation YY to implement certain components of the enhanced prudential standards 

required to be established under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank
 Act. The amendments became e
ffective on June 1, 2014. The 
enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for 

overall risk management, stress-test requirements, and a 15-t
o-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Council has 
determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The amendments also establish risk committee requirements and capital 
stress-testing requirements for certain BHCs
 and foreign banking organizations with 
total consolidated assets of $10 billion 
or more.  
     
16 
 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and Conforming Regulations 
 In May 2014, the IRS issued 
Notice 2014-33 (the ﬁNoticeﬂ) regarding FATCA 
and its related withholding provisions. The 
Notice announces that calendar years 2014 and 2015 will be regard
ed as a transition period for purposes of IRS enforcement 
and administration with respect to the implementation of FATC
A by withholding agents, foreign financial institutions and 
other entities with IRC chapter 4 responsibilities. The Notice also announces the IRS™s intention to further amend the 

regulations under Sections 1441, 1442, 1471, and 1472 of the IRC. Prior to the IRS issuing these amendments, taxpayers may 
rely on the provisions of the Notice regarding the proposed amendments to the regulations. The transition period and other 
guidance described in the Notice are intended to facilitate an 
orderly transition for withholding agent and foreign financial 
institution compliance with FATCA™s requirements and respond 
to comments regarding certain aspects of the regulations 
under chapters 3 and 4 of the IRC. BB&T expects to be in
 compliance with FATCA and its related provisions by the 
applicable effective dates. 
 Volcker Rule 
 The Volcker Rule implements section 619 of the Dodd-Frank
 Act and prohibits IDIs and affiliated companies ("banking 
entities") from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of
 certain securities, derivatives, and commodity futures, and 
options on these instruments, for their own account. The fina
l rules also impose limits on banking entities' investments in, an
d other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. Like the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules provide exemptions for 
certain activities, including market making, underwriting, he
dging, trading in government obligations, insurance company 
activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private eq
uity funds. The rules also clarify that certain activities are
 not 
prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian.  

 
The compliance requirements under the rules vary based on the size of the banking entity and the scope of activities 
conducted. Banking entities with significant trading operations 
will be required to establish a detailed compliance program, 
and their Chief Executive Officers will be required to attest th
at the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance 
with the final rules. Independent testing and analysis of an 
institution's compliance program also will be required. The final 
rules reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex institutions
 by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements. 
Additionally, a banking entity that does not engage in covered trading activities will not need to establish a compliance 
program.  
 Banking entities must conform proprietary trading activities to th
e final rule by July 21, 2015. The FRB has extended the 
compliance deadline to July 21, 2016 for purposes of conforming investments in and relationships with covered funds and 

foreign funds that were in place prior to
 December 31, 2013. The FRB also announc
ed its intention to grant banking entities 
an additional one-year extension of the conformance period fo
r legacy funds to July 21, 2017. These requirements are not 
expected to have a material impact on BB&T™s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

 
Deposit Insurance Assessments  
 
Branch Bank™s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up 
to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes 
a risk-based deposit premium assessment syst
em that determines assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate 
calculator, which is based on a number of
 elements to measure the risk each IDI 
poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is 
applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as define
d under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can 
change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subj
ect to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are 
assessed quarterly. 

 
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations 
 
In connection with its lending and leasing 
activities, Branch Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to
 protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Re
porting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts. 

     
17 
 CFPB  The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection 

laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending la
ws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and 
primary enforcement authority with respect to depository in
stitutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service 
providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt 
collectors and consumer reporting agencies. The CFPB has 
authority to prevent 
unfair, deceptive or abusive practices 
in connection with the offering of
 consumer financial products. The
 Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at 

the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state 
attorneys general to enforce co
mpliance with both the state and 
federal laws and regulations. 
 The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a 
variety of mortgage-related to
pics required under the Dodd-
Frank Act, including mortgage origina
tion disclosures, minimum 
underwriting standards and ability to repay, high-cost 
mortgage lending, and servicing practices. The rules related to
 ability to repay, qualified mortgage standards and mortgage 
servicing became effective in January 2014. The escrow and loan originator co
mpensation rules became effective during 
2013. A final rule integrating disclosure required by the Trut
h in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures 
Act becomes effective August 1, 2015. As 
a result of these rules, BB&T transferred 
the management of certain home equity 
loans from direct retail lending within the Community Banking segment to the Residential Mortgage Banking segment.  
 Interchange Fees 
 The FRB adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to 
certain electronic debit transactions are ﬁr
easonable and proportionalﬂ to the costs in
curred by issuers for such transactions.
 Interchange fees, or ﬁswipeﬂ fees, are charges that merchants pay to BB&T and other card-issuing banks for processing 
electronic payment transactions.  
 
During 2013, a U.S. Federal District Court judge ruled against the debit card interchange fee limits imposed by the FRB, 
resulting in the potential for further reductions to these caps.
 During March 2014, the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of 
Appeals overturned the 2013 lower court decision. During January 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, 
which preserved the limits established by the FRB.  
 Privacy 
 
Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy pr
otection provisions, including substantial customer privacy 
protections provided under th
e Financial Services Modernization Act of 19
99 (commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act). Under these provisions, a financial institution must pr
ovide to its customers, at the inception of the customer 
relationship and annually thereafter, the institution™s policies an
d procedures regarding the handling of customers™ nonpublic 
personal financial information. These provisions also provide
 that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may 
not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third par
ties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such 
information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it 

a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature 
by fraudulent or
 deceptive means. 
 CRA  
The CRA requires Branch Bank™s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank™s record in meeting 

the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. 
Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: ﬁOutstandi
ng,ﬂ ﬁSatisfactory,ﬂ ﬁNeeds to Improveﬂ or ﬁSubstantial 
Noncompliance.ﬂ This assessment is reviewed for any bank that 
applies to merge or consolidate 
with or acquire the assets or 
assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to ope
n or relocate a branch office.
 The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC, 
such as BB&T, also is assessed by the FRB in conn
ection with any acquisition or merger application. 
     
18 
 Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation  
 The FRB and FDIC have enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered 

by financial institutions. Regulation E prohibits financial instituti
ons from charging consumers fe
es for paying overdrafts on 
automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unle
ss a consumer consents, or opts 
in, to the overdraft service
 for those types of transactions. Financial institutions must also
 provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial 
institution™s overdraft services, including th
e fees associated with the service and th
e consumer™s choices. In addition, FDIC-
supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment prog
rams for ﬁexcessive or chroni
cﬂ customer use and undertake 
ﬁmeaningful and effectiveﬂ follow-up action with customers that
 overdraw their accounts more 
than six times during a rolling 
12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily li
mits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing 
procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and ensure board and 

management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs. 
 Patriot Act  
 The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering measures a
ffecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain other financial 
institutions. The Patriot Act includes the IMLAFA, which requi
res such financial institutions to implement policies and 
procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad 

authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements an
d restrictions on financial institutions™ operations. In additi
on, 
the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies 
to consider the effectiveness of
 a financial institution™s anti-
money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BH
C acquisitions. The U.S. Treasu
ry has issued a number of 
regulations to implement the Patriot Act, which impose obligations
 on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, 
procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing.  
 Other Regulatory Matters  
 BB&T is subject to examinations by federal and state banking 
regulators, as well as the SEC, the FINRA, the NYSE, various 
taxing authorities and various st
ate insurance and securities regulators. BB&T pe
riodically receives requests for information 
from regulatory authorities in various states, including state 
insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities 
regulators and other regulatory author
ities, concerning BB&T™s business and 
accounting practices. Such requests are 
considered incidental to the 
normal conduct of business. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2014, BB&T had approxima
tely 33,400 employees, the majority of
 which were full time, compared to 
approximately 35,000 employ
ees at December 31, 2013. 
 Website Access to BB&T™s Filings with the SEC
  BB&T™s electronic filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, 

Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act, as amended, are made av

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following discussion sets forth some of the more important
 risk factors that could materially affect BB&T™s financial 
condition and operations. When a risk factor spans several risk 
categories, the below risks have been listed by their primary 
risk category. Other factors that could affect the Company™s 
financial condition and operations are discussed in the ﬁForward-
Looking Statementsﬂ section above
. However, there may be additional risks that
 are not presently ma
terial or known, and 
factors besides those discussed below, or elsewhere in this or other reports that BB&T filed or furnished with the SEC, that 
also could adversely affect the Company. 
 Compliance Risk 
 Changes in banking laws could have a material adverse effect on BB&T. 
 BB&T is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the 

protection of depositors, federal DIFs and the banking system as 
a whole. In addition, BB&T is subject to changes in federal 
and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations and governmental economic and monetary policies. Any 

of these changes could adversely and materially affect BB&T. 
The current regulatory environment for financial institutions 
entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements
 and associated costs, includi
ng those related to consumer 
credit, with a focus on mortgage lending.  

 
Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These 
supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, 
higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on BB&T™s 
activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. 
 The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, and its 
related rulemaking activities, may result in lower revenues, 
higher costs and ratings downgrades. In addition, failure to meet the FRB™s capital planning and adequacy requirements and 
liquidity requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and other b
anking laws may limit the ability to pay dividends, pursue 
acquisitions and repurchase common stock. 
 
The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, 
addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial 
protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Under Dodd-
Frank, BB&T is deemed to be a ﬁsystemically importantﬂ institution. During 2014, federal agencies continued 
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of these provisions remain subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and 

interpretation by the applicable federal regulators, such as the 
Council, which will regulate the systemic risk of the financia
l system. Additionally, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant
 rules that impact nearly ever
y aspect of the lifecycle of 
a residential mortgage. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the 

Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Proc
edures Act. These rules have a direct impact on BB&T™s 
operations, as BB&T is both a mortgage originator and a servicer. 

 
Due to BB&T™s size, it is subject to additional regulations such as the ﬁliving willﬂ requirements relating to the rapid and 
orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions
 in the event of material fi
nancial distress or failure. BB&
T cannot predict the additional effects that compliance with th
e Dodd-Frank Act or any regulations will have on BB&T™s 
businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunitie
s. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act 
may materially adversely affect BB&T™s business, financ
ial condition or results of operations. See ﬁRegulatory 
Considerationsﬂ for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act and its impact upon BB&T. 
 In addition, BB&T has been subject to assessment by the FRB as part of the CCAR program. CCAR is an annual exercise by 
the FRB to ensure that institutions have 
forward-looking capital planning processes 
that account for their 
risks and sufficient
 capital to continue operations throughout times of economic an
d financial stress. BB&T cannot be certain that the FRB will 
have no objections to BB&T™s future capital plans submitte
d through the CCAR program. Failu
re to pass the CCAR review 
could adversely affect BB&T™s ability to pay dividends,
 enter into acquisitions and repurchase common stock.
     
22 
  BB&T may be subject to more stringent capital requirements, which could diminish its ability to pay dividends or require 
BB&T to reduce its operations. 

 The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk-based capital requirements and 
leverage limits applicable to banks and BHCs. During 2013, the FRB approved final rules that established a new 

comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and established a more conservative definition of capital. 
Once adopted and fully phased in, banking organizations such as BB&T would be required to meet enhanced minimum 
capital and leverage ratios. These requirements, and any other new regulations, including those that have been proposed but 

not yet implemented as a result of the requirements established by the BCBS, could adversely affect BB&T™s ability to pay 
dividends, or could require BB&T to limit certain business activitie
s or to raise capital, which may adversely affect its resul
ts of operations or financial condition. In addition, the co
sts associated with complyi
ng with more stringent capital 
requirements, such as the requirement to formulate and subm
it capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios on an 
annual basis, could have a material adverse effect on BB&T. See ﬁRegulatory Considerationsﬂ for additional information 

regarding the capital requirements unde
r the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. 
 
Differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations and
 any potential resulting litigation may adversely impact BB&T™s 
financial statements. 
 Local, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws
 and regulations differently than BB&T and challenge tax 
positions that BB&T has taken on its tax returns. This may re
sult in differences in the treat
ment of revenues, deductions, 
credits and/or differences in the timing of
 these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes
, interest or penalties that could have a material adverse effe
ct on BB&T™s results. For example, as discussed in Note 13 
ﬁIncome Taxesﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Stat
ements,ﬂ in February 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory 
notice of deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liab
ility for taxes, penalties and interest of approximately $892 
million. Related developments resulted in a $516 million charge in 2013. Potential developments in BB&T™s litigation or in 

similar cases could adversely affect BB&T™s financial position or results of operations. 
 Credit Risk 

 Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions and deterioration in the geographic and financial markets in 
which BB&T operates could lead to higher loan charge-offs and reduce BB&T™s net income and growth. 
 BB&T™s business is subject to periodic fluctuations based 
on national, regional and lo
cal economic conditions. These 
fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on BB&T™s operations and 
financial condition even if other favorable events occur. BB&T™s banking operations are locally oriented and community-
based. Accordingly, BB&T expects to continue to be dependent
 upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the 
local residential and CRE markets it serves. 
For example, an increase in unemployment,
 a decrease in real estate values or 
increases in interest rates, as well as
 other factors, could weaken the economie
s of the communities BB&T serves. Weakness 
in BB&T™s market area could depress its earnings 
and consequently its financial condition because: 
  customers may not want or need BB&T™s products or services;  
  borrowers may not be able or willing to repay their loans;  
  the value of the collateral securing loans to borrowers may decline; and  
  the quality of BB&T™s loan portfolio may decline. 
 Any of the latter three scenarios could require BB&T to charge off a higher percentage of loans and/or increase provisions for 
credit losses, which would reduce BB&T™s net income. Credit deteri
oration, combined with flat to declining real estate 
values, would result in increased loan charge-offs and higher provisions for credit losses, which may negatively impact 
BB&T™s net income. 
 
A systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in 
the financial sector, volatility in the financial markets and/or 
reduced business activity could materially 
adversely affect BB&T™s business, financ
ial condition and results of operations. 
     
23 
 Further downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material 
adverse effect on BB&T™s operations, earnings and financial condition. 
 
In 2011, the S&P credit rating agency lowered its long term 
sovereign credit rating on the United States from AAA to AA+, 
which reflected S&P™s view that an August 2011 agreement of
 U.S. lawmakers regarding the debt ceiling fell short of what 
would be necessary to stabilize the U.S. government™s medium term debt dynamics. In June 2013, S&P reaffirmed that 

rating, while raising its outlook from ﬁNegativeﬂ to ﬁStable.ﬂ 
The three other major credit rating agencies did not downgrade 
their previously issued U.S. sovereign credit ratings, though some have issued negative outlooks at various times over the last
 several years. While the risk of a sovereign credit ratings do
wngrade of the U.S. government, including the rating of U.S. 
Treasury securities, has been reduced, the possibility still re
mains. It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived 
creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed
 by institutions or agencies directly linked to the U.S. 
government could also be correspondingly affected by any such downgrade. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the 

balance sheets of financial institutions, including BB&T, and are 
widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet 
their day-to-day cash flow needs in the short-term debt market. 
 A possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived 
creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could im
pact BB&T™s ability to obtain funding that is collateralized 
by affected instruments, as well as affect
 the pricing of that funding when it is 
available. A downgrade may also adversely 
affect the market value of such instru
ments. BB&T cannot predict if, when or ho
w any changes to the credit ratings or 
perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect
 economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a 
significant adverse impact on BB&T. For example, BB&T™s secu
rities portfolio consists largely of MBS issued by GSEs, 
such as FHLMC and FNMA. Among other things, a further downgrade in the U.S. government™s credit rating could 

adversely impact the value of these securities and may trigger 
requirements that the Company post additional collateral for 

trades relative to these securities. A down
grade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings o
f related institutions, agencies or instrument
s would significantly exacerbate the other 
risks to which BB&T is subject and any 
related adverse effects on the business, fi
nancial condition and results of operations. 
 The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BB&T. 
 
Financial services institutions are interrela
ted as a result of trading, clearing, co
unterparty, or other relationships. BB&T h
as 
exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute 

transactions with counterparties in the financial services
 industry, including brokers 
and dealers, commercial banks, 
investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutions
. Many of these transactions expose BB&T to credit risk in 
the event of default of its c
ounterparty. In addition, BB&T™s credit risk may 
be exacerbated when collateral is liquidated at 
prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. These types of losses could materially and
 adversely affect BB&T™s results of operations or financial condition. 

 
The expiration of the loss sharing agreements related to the 
Colonial acquisition could result in increased losses on loans 
and securities.  

 
In connection with its acquisition of Colonial, BB&T entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which provided 
that a significant portion of losses related to the acquired loan
 portfolios would be borne by the FDIC. Effective October 1, 
2014, loans and securities subject to the commercial loss sharing 
agreement with the FDIC were no longer covered by loss 
sharing. These loans and secu
rities totaled $561 million and $1.2 billion,
 respectively, as of December 31, 2014. 
 Additionally, the single family loss sharing 
agreement ends in 
2019. Any charge-off of relate
d losses that BB&T experiences 
after the term of the single family loss sharing agreement will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact 
BB&T™s net income. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 BB&T™s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to acce
ss the capital markets,
 an unforeseen ou
tflow of cash or a 
reduction in the credit ratings for BB&T or its subsidiaries. 
 
Liquidity is essential to BB&T™s businesses. When volatility or
 disruptions occur in the capital markets, BB&T™s ability to 
access capital could be materially impaired. 
Additionally, other factors outside of BB&T™s control, such as a general market 
disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties, could impair BB&T™
s ability to access capital markets or creat
e an unforeseen outflow of cash or depo
sits. BB&T™s inability to access the capital ma
rkets could constrain its ability to make 
new loans, to meet its existing lending commitments and ultimately jeopardize its overall liquidity and capitalization. 

     
24 
 BB&T™s credit ratings are also important to its liquidity. Rati
ng agencies regularly evaluate BB&T and its subsidiaries, and 
their ratings are based on a number of f
actors, including the financial strength of 
BB&T and its subsidiaries, as well as facto
rs not entirely within BB&T™s control, including conditions affectin
g the financial services industry generally. As a result, ther
e can be no assurance that BB&T will maintain its current ratings. A reduction in BB&T™s credit ra
tings could adversely affect 
BB&T™s liquidity and competitive position, increase its borrowing costs, limit its 
access to the capital markets or trigger 
unfavorable contractual obligations. 
 Market Risk 
 Turmoil and volatility in global financial markets could have a material adverse effect on BB&T™s operations, earnings and 
financial condition. 
 The negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from the EU, Puerto Rico and other sovereign debt matters 
could adversely affect BB&T™s business, financial condition and 
liquidity. Global conflicts and political activity could cause 
turmoil and volatility in the financial markets, which could reduce the value of BB&T™s assets or cause a reduction in 
liquidity that adversely impacts BB&T™s financial condition and results of operations.  
 
The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the FRB, have a significant impact on market 
interest rates, and BB&T™s business and financial perform
ance is impacted significantly by such interest rates. 
 BB&T™s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and ot
her policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the 
U.S., non-U.S. governments and internatio
nal agencies. The FRB regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. The 
federal policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and 
investments. The market impact from su
ch policies can also materially decrease 
the value of certain of BB&T™s financial 
assets, most notably debt securities. Changes in the federa
l policies are beyond BB&T™s control and, consequently, the 
impact of these changes on BB&T™s activities and 
results of operations is difficult to predict.
  Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on BB&T™s profitability. 
 
BB&T™s earnings and financial condition are largely dependent 
on net interest income, which is the difference between 
interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate 

spreads could adversely affect BB&T™s earnings and financia
l condition. BB&T cannot control or predict with certainty 
changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic cond
itions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory 
authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect inte
rest income and interest expense. As discussed in ﬁMarket 
Risk Management Œ Interest Rate Market Risk (Other than Trading),ﬂ BB&T has ongoing policies and procedures designed 
to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates still may have an 
adverse effect on BB&T™s profitability. For example, rising in
terest rates could adversely affect BB&T™s mortgage banking 
business because higher interest rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages. Similarly, rising interest rates may
 increase the cost of BB&T™s deposits, which are a primary source of funding. While BB&T actively manages against these 

risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies, if 
BB&T™s assumptions regarding borr
ower behavior are wrong or 
overall economic conditions are significantly different than antic
ipated, the Company™s risk mitigation techniques may be 
insufficient. 
 
Loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the Company™s funding costs. 
 Deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. BB&T comp
etes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. 

Funding costs may increase because the Company may lose de
posits and replace them with more expensive sources of 
funding, clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the Company may need to raise its interest rates to avoi
d losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the Company™s NIM, net interest income and net income.  

     
25 
 Operational Risk 
 BB&T faces cybersecurity risks, including ﬁdenial of service attacks,ﬂ ﬁhackingﬂ and ﬁidentity theftﬂ that could result in the 

disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect BB
&T™s business or reputation and create significant legal and 
financial exposure. 

 
BB&T™s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, 
such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activitie
s or identity theft. Financial services institutions and compani
es engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the secu
rity of their websites or other systems, some of which have 
involved sophisticated and targeted attack
s intended to obtain unauth
orized access to confidential information, destroy data, 
disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks 
and other means.
 Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, 
including BB&T. None of these events resulted in a breach of BB&T™s client data or account information; however, the 

performance of BB&T™s website, www.bbt.com, was adversely a
ffected, and in some instances customers were prevented 
from accessing BB&T™s website. BB&T expects to be subject to simi
lar attacks in the future. While
 events to date primarily 
resulted in inconvenience, future cyber-attacks could be more
 disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in 
particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and BB&T may not be able to anticipate 

or prevent all such attacks. BB&T may incur increasing costs in 
an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for 
any security breach or loss. 

 
Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of 
its systems, BB&T will not be able to antic
ipate all security breaches of these type
s, and BB&T may not be able to implement effective preventive m
easures against such security breaches. The techniques used 
by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as 

external service providers, organized crim
e affiliates, terrorist organizations or ho
stile foreign governments. Those parties 
may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers 
or other users of BB&T™s systems to disclose sensitive 
information in order to gain access to its data or that of its
 clients. These risks may increas
e in the future as the Company 
continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-bas
ed product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-
based products and applications. 

 
A successful penetration or circ
umvention of system security 
could cause serious negative consequences to BB&T, including 
significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of BB&T or that of its customers, or 

damage to computers or systems of the Co
mpany or those of its cust
omers and counterparties. A 
security breach could result 
in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial lo
ss to BB&T or to its customers, loss of confidence in BB&T™s 
security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to BB&T™s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse 

effect on the Company. 
 BB&T relies on its employees, systems and certain counterparties,
 and certain failures could materially adversely affect 
operations. 
 BB&T™s business is dependent on the ability to process, reco
rd and monitor a large number of complex transactions. The 
Company could be materially adversely affe
cted if one or more of its employees ca
uses a significant op
erational breakdown 
or failure, either as a result of human er
ror or intentionally. Financial, accounting, or other data 
processing systems may fai
l or have other significant shortcomings that materially adversely affect BB&T™s business. In addition, products, services and 

processes are continually changing and BB&T may not fully identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. 
Any of these occurrences could diminish the ability to operate one
 or more LOBs or result in potential liability to clients, 
increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (includi
ng fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory 
intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could be material to the Company. 
 If personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients were to be mishandled or misused, significant regulatory 

consequences, reputational damage and financial loss could occur. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances 
where, for example, such information was 
erroneously provided to parties who are 
not permitted to have the information, 
either through the fault of systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise 

inappropriately taken by third parties. 
     
26 
 BB&T may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems aris
ing from events that are wholly or partially beyond its 
control, which may include, for 
example, security breaches; electrical or tel
ecommunications outages; failures of computer 
servers or other damage to property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from 
political events, including terrorist acts. There can be no assura
nce that disaster recovery or other plans will fully mitigate
 all potential business continuity risks. Any failures or disruptio
ns of systems or operations could impact BB&T™s ability to 
service its clients, which could adversel
y affect BB&T™s results of operations 
by subjecting BB&T to losses, litigation, 
regulatory fines or penalties or by requiring the expenditure of
 significant resources to correct the failure or disruption.  
 
Significant litigation could have a material adverse effect on BB&T. 

 BB&T faces legal risks in its business, and the volume of cl
aims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation 
and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain
s high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory 
action against BB&T may have material adverse financial effect
s or cause significant reputational harm to BB&T, which in 
turn could seriously harm BB&T™s business prospects. 
 BB&T faces significant operational and other risks related to its activities, which could expose it to negative publicity, 
litigation and/or regulatory action. 

 BB&T is exposed to many types of risks, including operational, reputational, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or 
theft by employees or outsiders (including identity and info
rmation theft), unauthorized transactions by employees or 
operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or 
telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result 
from BB&T™s actual or alleged conduct in any number of 
activities, including lending practices, corporate governance 
and acquisitions, activities related to asset sales and balance 
sheet management and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those 

activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect BB&T™s
 ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to 
litigation and regulatory action. 
 Because the nature of the financial services business involves a hi
gh volume of transactions, cert
ain errors may be repeated or
 compounded before they are discovered 
and successfully rectified. BB&T™s necessa
ry dependence upon automated systems 
to record and process its transaction volume may further incr
ease the risk that technical fl
aws or employee tampering or 
manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are diffi
cult to detect. BB&T also may be subject to disruptions of it
s operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or 

electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or 
liability. BB&T is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations
 (or 
will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors 
by their respective employees as is BB&T) and to the risk that 
BB&T™s (or its vendors™) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. 

 
BB&T relies on other companies to provide certain 
key components of its business infrastructure. 
 
Third party vendors provide certain key components of BB&T™s bu
siness infrastructure such as internet connections, network 
access and mutual fund distribution. While BB&T has selected 
these third party vendors caref
ully, it does not control their 
operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide agreed upon goods and services for any reason, or their 

poor performance of services, could adve
rsely affect BB&T™s ability to deliver prod
ucts and services to its customers and 
otherwise conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. 
 BB&T may not be able to successfully integrate bank or nonbank mergers and acquisitions. 

 Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of BHCs, banks and other nonbank entities BB&T 
acquires and, as a result, BB&T may not be able to achieve th
e cost savings and synergies that it expects will result from such
 transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on conso
lidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating 
duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for 
outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent 
upon the integration of the acquired or merged entity™s busine
sses with BB&T or one of BB&T™s subsidiaries, the conversion 
of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization of business practices. Complications or 

difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems, data 
systems and products may result in the loss of customers, 
damage to BB&T™s reputation within the financial services 
industry, operational problems, one-time costs currently not 
anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such mergers 
or acquisitions. Annual cost savi
ngs in each such transaction 
may be materially less than anticipated if the holding compan
y, bank merger or nonbank merger or acquisition is delayed 
unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond wh
at is anticipated or the conversion to a single set of data 
systems is not accomplished on a timely basis.  
     
27 
 Difficulty in integrating an acquired company may cause BB&T 
not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 
increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result 
in higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, disruption of BB&T™s businesses or the businesses of the 

acquired company, or otherwise adversely 
affect BB&T™s ability to maintain relations
hips with customers and employees or 
achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory 

authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be great
er than expected. As a result of these and other factors, 
BB&T could incur losses on acquired assets and increased expens
es resulting from the failure to
 successfully integrate an 
acquired company, which could adversely impact its financial condition or results of operations.  

 
BB&T may not be able to successfully implement a new ERP system, which could adversely affect BB&T™s business 
operations and profitability.  
 BB&T is investing significant resources in an enterprise-wid
e initiative aimed at implementing an integrated ERP financial 
platform, utilizing certain 
modules of SAP software. The objective of the ne
w ERP system is to modernize and consolidate 
many of the existing systems that are currently used for a variety of functions throughout the Company, including both 

internal and external financial reporting. BB&T may not be
 able to successfully implement and integrate the new ERP 
system, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with 
legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanc
tions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include 
fines and suspension of trading in BB&T stock, among others. 
In addition, a number of core business processes could be 
affected. The implementation could extend past the expected tim
ing and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could 
increase the costs associated
 with the implementation as well as ongoing operations. 
 
Failure to implement part or all of the ERP system could 
result in impairment charges that adversely impact BB&T™s 
financial condition and results of operations and could result 
in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective 
components. In addition, BB&T may incur significant training
, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses 
during and after the implementation, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time. 

 Strategic and Other Risk
  BB&T may experience significant competition in its market area
, which may reduce its customer base or cause it to lower 
prices for its products and services in order to maintain market share. 

 There is intense competition among commercial banks in BB&
T™s market area. In addition, BB&T competes with other 
providers of financial services, such as savings and loan asso
ciations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities 
firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing co
mpanies, the mutual funds in
dustry, full-service brokerage 
firms and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations than BB&T is with respect to the 
products and services they provide. BB&T™s success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products and services to 

evolving industry standards and customer expectations. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower 
prices. Lower prices can reduce BB&T™s NIM and revenues from its fee-based products and services. 
 
In addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile phone applications 
and advanced ATM functionality could require BB&T to make 
substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing 
products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in BB&T™s business may not produce expected growth in 

earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. BB&T may not be successful in introducing new products and services, 
achieving market acceptance of its product
s and services, anticipatin
g or reacting to consumer
s™ changing technological 
preferences or developing and maintaining loyal customers. 
 Some of BB&T™s larger competitors, including certain nationa
l banks that have a significant presence in BB&T™s market 
area, may have greater capital and resources than BB&T, may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services 
not offered by BB&T. Any potential adve
rse reactions to BB&T™s financial conditio
n or status in the marketplace, as 
compared to its competitors, could limit BB&T™s ability to attract and retain customers and to compete for new business 

opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business may have a material 
and adverse effect on BB&T™s financial condition and results of operations. 
     
28 
 BB&T also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside of its market area. Some of these institutions 
conduct business primarily over the Internet and thus may be 
able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and 
services at more favorable rates and with
 greater convenience to the customer, who 
can pay bills and transfer funds directly 
without going through a bank. This could result in the loss of fe
e income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income 
generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consum
er spending and saving habits
 could adversely affect BB&T™s 
operations, and the Company may be unable to develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes 
on a timely basis or at all. 
 BB&T may not be able to complete future acquisitions. 

 BB&T must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions
 before it can complete an acquisition of another bank or 
BHC, including federal and/or state regulatory approvals. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank or BHC 

acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors,
 the effect of the acquisitio
n on competition, financial 
condition and future prospects, including current and projected
 capital ratios and levels, th
e competence, experience and 
integrity of management and record of compliance with laws
 and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities 
to be served, including the acquiring institution™s record of 
compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring 
institution in combating money laundering activities and protests from various stakeholders of both BB&T and its acquisition 

partner. Also, under the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. regulators must now take systemic risk into account when evaluating whether 
to approve a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like BB&T. BB&T cannot be certain 
when or if, or on what terms and cond
itions, any required regulatory approvals w
ill be granted. In specific cases, BB&T may 
be required to sell banks or branches, or
 take other actions as a condition to recei
ving regulatory approval. An inability to 
satisfy other conditions necessary to consum
mate an acquisition transaction, such as
 third-party litigation, a judicial order 
blocking the transaction or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent BB&T from completing an announced 

acquisition. 
 Catastrophic events could have a ma
terial adverse effect on BB&T. 
 The occurrence of catastrophic 
events such as hurricanes, tr
opical storms, tornados, winter
 storms and other large scale 
catastrophes could adversely affect BB&T™s consolidated financ
ial condition or results of operations. BB&T has operations 
and customers along the Gulf an
d Atlantic coasts as well as other parts of the southeastern United States, which could be 
adversely impacted by hurricanes and other severe weather in 
those regions. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could 
have an adverse effect on BB&T in that such events could ma
terially disrupt its operations or the ability or willingness of its
 customers to access the financial services
 offered by BB&T. BB&T™s property and casualty insurance operations also expose 
it to claims arising out of catastrophes. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although 

BB&T carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce 
BB&T™s earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for an
y fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect
 on BB&T™s financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 BB&T leases its headquarters in Winston-Salem, North Carolin
a and owns or leases other 
significant office space in the 
vicinity of its headquarters. BB&T owns free-standing opera
tions centers, with its primary operations and information

located and suitably equipped to serve as financial services f
acilities. See Note 5 ﬁPremises and Equipmentﬂ in the ﬁNotes to

onal disclosures related to properties and other fixed assets.

   Common Stock, Dividends and Share Repurchases 
 BB&T™s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on earnings from operations, the adequacy of capital and the 
availability of liquid assets for distribution and is subject to
 the FRB not objecting to its capital plan. BB&T™s ability to 
generate liquid assets for distribution is dependent on the ability of Branch Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. 
The payment of cash dividends is an integral part of providing a competitive return on shareholders™ investments. The 
Company™s policy is to accomplish this while
 retaining sufficient capital 
to support future growth
 and to meet regulatory 
requirements. Management has established a guideline that 
the common dividend payout ratio will be between 30% and 50% 
and the total payout ratio (including dividends and share re
purchases) will be between 30% and 80% of basic EPS during 
normal economic conditions. BB&T™s common dividend payout ratio, computed by dividing dividends declared per common 

share by basic EPS, was 34.1% in 2014 compared to 41.4% in 2013. BB&T has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every 

year since 1903. BB&T expects common dividend declarations, if declared, to occur in January, April, July and October with 
payment dates on or about the first of 
March, June, September and December. A di
scussion of dividend
 restrictions is included in Note 16 ﬁRegulatory Requirements and Other Restrictionsﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ 
and in the ﬁRegulatory Considerationsﬂ section. 
 Share Repurchases 
 BB&T has periodically repurchased shares of its own common stock. In accordance with North Carolina law, repurchased 
shares cannot be held as treasury stock, but revert to the status of authorized and unissued shares upon repurchase. 
 The Board of Directors has granted authority under the 2006 Repurc
hase Plan for the repurchase of
 up to 50 million shares of 
BB&T™s common stock. The 2006 Repurchase Plan remains in ef
fect until all the authorized shares are repurchased unless 
the plan is modified by the Board of Directors. No shares were repurchased in connection with the 2006 Repurchase Plan 

during 2014, 2013, or 2012.

Key Challenges  
 BB&T™s business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years. Consequently, management has annually 
evaluated and, as necessary, adjusted the 
Company™s business strategy in the contex
t of the current operating environment. 
During this process, management considers the current 
financial condition and performance of the Company and its 
expectations for future economic activity from both a national an
d local market perspective. The achievement of BB&T™s key 
strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is
 subject to many uncertainties and challenges. In the opinion 
of management, the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance are presented 
below:  
  Intense competition within the financial services industry given the challenge in growing assets during a period of 
sustained low interest rates. 
     
34 
  Global economic and geopolitical risk, including potential financial system instability and ramifications of sovereign 
debt issues. 
  Cost and risk associated with regulatory reform and initiatives and IT projects. 

  Merger integration risk. 
 In addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events c
ould have a near term impact on BB&T™s financial condition and 
results of operations. See the section titled ﬁForward-Looking 
Statementsﬂ for additional examples of such challenges.  
 
Overview of Significant Events and Financial Results  
 BB&T generated strong operating results for 2014, despite the challenges associated with the continued low interest rate 
environment, increased costs associated with certain regulat
ory initiatives and intense competition for loans to qualified 
borrowers. From a NIM perspec
tive, the negative impact associated with lower yields on new loans and securities was 
partially mitigated by a decrease in funding costs from 0.75% to 
0.65%, primarily driven by a d
ecline in the cost of interest-
bearing deposits and the early extingu
ishment of certain FHLB advances during the third quarter of 2014.   
 Consolidated net income available to common shareholders fo
r 2014 totaled $2.0 billion, an increase of $441 million 
compared to $1.6 billion earned during 2013. On a diluted pe
r common share basis, earnings for 2014 were $2.75, compared 
to $2.19 for 2013. Earnings for 2013 were reduced by $516 million of tax adjustments. BB&T™s results of operations for 

2014 produced a return on average assets of 1.20% and a retu
rn on average common shareholde
rs™ equity of 9.40% compared 
to prior year ratios of 0.95% and 8.06%, respectively.  

 BB&T™s revenues for 2014 were $9.3 billion on a FTE basis, a decrease of $398 million compared to 2013. Net interest 

income on a FTE basis was $245 million lower than the prior y
ear, which reflects a $368 million 
decrease in interest income 
that was partially offset by a decrease in funding costs tota
ling $123 million. Noninterest income decreased $153 million for 
the year, driven by a $170 million decline in mortgage banking income, which reflects a decline in the volume of residential 

mortgage loan production and sales and tighter margins. 
 The provision for credit losses declined $341 million, or
 57.6%, compared to the pr
ior year, reflecting continued 
improvement in credit quality. The provision for credit losses also benefited from loan sales that generated a combined $66 
million in gains through the release of the related ALLL. 
 
Asset quality improved significantly during 2014 as NPAs declined $392 million, or 33.4%, compared to 2013. This decline 
included a $319 million decrease in NPLs, partially due to loan 
sales, and a $73 million decrease in foreclosed real estate and
 other property. Net charge-offs for 2014 were $538 million, co
mpared to $792 million for the prior year. The ratio of the 
ALLL to net charge-offs was 2.74x for 2014, compared to 2.19x in 2013.  

 Noninterest expense increased $84 million primarily due to a $122 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and $118 

million in charges related to the FHA-insured loan originatio
n process. These increases were
 partially offset by a $113 
million decrease in personnel expense primarily due to reduced pension expense. 

 
Effective October 1, 2014, loans and securities subject to the 
commercial loss sharing agreement 
with the FDIC related to the 
Colonial acquisition were no lo
nger covered by loss sharing. At December 31, 
2014, these loans had a carrying value of $561 
million and a UPB of $836 million, and the securities had a carrying value of $1.2 billion.  
 BB&T™s total assets at December 31, 2014
 were $186.8 billion, an increase of $3
.8 billion compared to December 31, 2013. 
This increase includes a $4.2 billion increase in loans and leases due to broad-based loan growth, with commercial and 
industrial up $2.9 billion, sales finance up $1.2 billion and other lending subsidiaries up $1.0 billion. A decline in direct r
etail lending balances and a corresponding increase in residential mort
gage balances reflect the impact of an $8.3 billion transfer 
that occurred during the first quarter of 2014. Excluding this transfer, mortgage balances declined due to the previously 

mentioned loan sales, lower origination volume and manageme
nt™s decision to sell substantially all conforming mortgage 
loan production. HTM securities increased $2
.1 billion, while AFS securities declined $1
.2 billion. Other assets declined $1.4 
billion due to a $309 million decrease in th
e FDIC loss share receivable and a $1.0
 billion decline in 
commercial factoring 
balances. 
     
35 
 Total deposits at December 31, 2014 were
 $129.0 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 1.2%
, from the prior year. The 
increase in deposits reflects strong growth in noninterest-bear
ing deposits, which were up $3.8 billion or 10.9% compared to 
the prior year. Interest 
checking and money market and savings grew $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, while time 
deposits and IRAs declined $5.7 billion. The increase in total 
deposits also reflects the previously mentioned acquisition of 
21 branches in Texas during the second qu
arter. The average cost of interest-beari
ng deposits for 2014 was 0.26%, a decline 
of six basis points compared to the prior year. 
 Total shareholders™ equity increased $1.6 billion, or 7.1%, comp
ared to the prior year. This in
crease was primarily driven by 
net income in excess of dividends totaling $1.4 billion. BB&T™s Ti
er 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios a
t December 31, 2014 increased to 12.4% an
d 14.9%, respectively, compared to 11
.8% and 14.3% at D
ecember 31, 2013, 
respectively. BB&T™s risk-based capital ratios remain well 
above regulatory standards for 
well-capitalized banks. BB&T™s 
Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio, which is based on manage
ment™s interpretation of the F
RB rules that became effective 
on January 1, 2015, was 10.3% at December 31, 
2014, versus 9.7% at December 31, 2013.  
 Net Interest Income and NIM 
 
Net interest income is BB&T™s primary source of revenue. Net 
interest income is influenced by a number of factors, 
including the volume, mix and maturity of interest-earning asse
ts and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earne
d and paid thereon. The difference between rates earned on interest
-earning assets and the cost of funds (with a FTE adjustment 
made to tax-exempt items to provide comparability
 with taxable items) is measured by the NIM. 
 2014 compared to 2013 
 
For 2014, net interest income on a FTE basis totaled $5.5 billi
on, a decrease of $245 million or 4.3% compared to the prior 
year. The decrease in net interest income reflects lower yields on new loans and securities and runoff in the loan portfolio 

acquired from the FDIC, partially offset by lower funding co
sts, which declined $123 million compared to 2013. The 
improvement in funding costs reflects a six basis point reducti
on in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits due to 
improved mix and a 67 basis point reduction in the average cost of long-term debt primarily due to the early extinguishment 

of $1.1 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances during th
e third quarter and lower rates on new issuances.  
 The FTE-adjusted NIM is the pr
imary measure used in evaluating the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning 
assets. The FTE-adjusted NIM was 3.42% 
in 2014 compared with 3.68% in 2013.
 The decline in the NIM reflects lower 
yields on loans and securities, partially offset by the lower 
funding costs described above. The average annualized FTE yield 
for total loans and leases was 4.42% for 2
014, compared to 4.85% for the prior year
. The decrease was primarily due to lower 
yields on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yi
elding loans acquired from the FDIC. The FTE yield on the total 
securities portfolio was 2.45% for th
e year ended December 31, 2014, comp
ared to 2.51% fo
r the prior year. 
 The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2014 dropped to 0.26%, from 0.32% in 2013. This improvement was 
driven by an 18 basis point reduction in the cost of time deposits and IRAs.  
 
The rates paid on average short-term borrowings declined to 0.13% in 2014 from 0.16% in 2013. At December 31, 2014, the 
targeted Federal funds rate was a range of zero percent to 0.25
%. The average rate on long-term debt during 2014 was 2.36%, 
compared to 3.03% for the prior year. This decline reflects the 
previously mentioned early extinguishment of $1.1 billion of 
higher-cost FHLB advances and lower rates on new issuances. 

 2013 compared to 2012 

 For 2013, net interest income on an FTE-adjusted basis totaled 
$5.8 billion, a decrease of $244 
million or 4.1%, compared to 
the prior year. The decrease in net interest income reflects lo
wer yields on new loans and securities and runoff in the loan 
portfolio acquired from the FDIC, partially offset by lower 
funding costs, which declined $170 million compared to 2012. 

The improvement in funding costs reflects an 11 basis point reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits and a 
lower average long-term debt balance. 
     
36 
 The FTE-adjusted NIM is the pr
imary measure used in evaluating the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning 
assets. The FTE-adjusted NIM was 3.68% in
 2013 compared with 3.91% in 2012. Th
e decline in the NI
M primarily reflects 
lower yields on new loans and securities and runoff of loans 
acquired from the FDIC, partially offset by the lower funding 
costs described above. The average annualized FTE yield for to
tal loans and leases was 4.85% for 2013, compared to 5.35% 
for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields 
on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yielding 
loans acquired from FDIC. The FTE yield on the total securities 
portfolio was 2.51% for the year ended December 31, 2013, 
compared to 2.64% for the prior 
year. This decrease reflects runoff
 in the security portfolio acquired from FDIC and security 
duration adjustments.  
 
The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits dropped to 0.32% during 2013, from 0.43% in 2012. This improvement 
included a 16 basis point reduction in the cost of time deposits and IRAs and a five basis point reduction in the cost of money
 market and savings accounts. 

 The rates paid on average short-term borro
wings declined from 0.26% in 2012 to 
0.16% during 2013. At
 December 31, 2013, 
the targeted Federal funds rate was a range of zero percent to
 0.25%. The average rate on long-term debt during 2013 was 
3.03%, an increase of one basis point compared to the prior 
year. This increase reflects the 
redemption of all higher cost 
junior subordinated debt to unconsolidated trusts and the related benefit asso
ciated with accelerated amortization of 
derivatives that were unwound in a gain position during 2012, partially offset by lower effective rates on new debt issued 
during 2013. 
 
Acquired from the FDIC and FD
IC Loss Share Receivable/Payable 
 
In connection with the Colonial acquisition, Branch Bank entere
d into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC that outline the 
terms and conditions under which the FDIC will reimburse Branch 
Bank for a portion of the losses incurred on certain loans, 
OREO, investment securities and other assets. The FDIC™s obliga
tion to reimburse Branch Bank for losses with respect to 
assets acquired from the FDIC began with the first dollar of loss incurred.

The loss sharing provisions of the commercial loss sharing agreement have expired; however, gains on the disposition of 
assets subject to this agreement will be shared
 with the FDIC through September 30, 2017.  
(2) 
Loans and leases subject to the commerci
al and single family loss share agreements had a UPB of $836 million and $888 
million, respectively. 
 Assets subject to the single family loss sharing 
agreement are indemnified 
through August 31, 2019. 
 
As of October 1, 2014, the loss sharing provisions of the co
mmercial loss sharing agreement ex
pired. As a result, losses on 
the assets subject to this agreement (commercial loans, other 
related assets and certain AFS securities) are no longer shared 
with the FDIC. However, gains on the disposition of assets subj
ect to this agreement will be 
shared with the FDIC through 
September 30, 2017. Any gains realized after September 30, 2017 would not be shared with the FDIC. 
 
The gain/loss sharing coverage related to the acquired AFS secu
rities is based on a contractually-specified value of the 
securities as of the date of the loss sharin
g agreement, adjusted to re
flect subsequent pay-downs, redemptions or maturities on
 the underlying securities. The contractually-specified value 
of these securities totaled approximately $626 million at 
December 31, 2014. During the period of ga
in sharing (October 1, 2014 through Septem
ber 30, 2017), any decline in the fair 
value of the acquired AFS securities down to the contractually-specified value would reduce BB&T™s liability to the FDIC at 

the applicable loss sharing percentage. BB&T is not indemnified fo
r declines in the fair value of the acquired securities below
 the contractually-specified amount. 
     
37 
 The terms of the loss sharing agreement 
with respect to certain non-agency MBS provided that Branch Bank would be 
reimbursed by the FDIC for 95% of any and all losses incurred through the third quarter of 2014. For other assets acquired 
from the FDIC, the FDIC reimbursement was as follows: 

  80% of net losses incurred up to $5 billion 
 95% of net losses in excess of $5 billion.  
 
BB&T does not expect cumulative net losse
s to exceed $5 billion on the respective 
assets acquired from FDIC. Gains and 
recoveries on assets acquired from FDIC, net of related expenses, will offset 
losses or be paid to the FDIC at the applicable 
loss share percentage at the time of recovery.  

 
Following the conclusion of the 10 year loss share period in
 2019, should actual aggregate losses, excluding securities, be 
less than an amount determined in accord
ance with these agreements, BB&T will pay 
the FDIC a portion of the difference. 
As of December 31, 2014, BB&T projects th
at in 2019 Branch Bank would owe the FDIC approx
imately $177 million under 
the aggregate loss calculation. As described below, this lia
bility is expensed over time and BB&T has recognized total 
expense of approximately $132 mil
lion through December 31, 2014.  
 
The fair value of the net reimbursemen
t the Company expected to receive from
 the FDIC under these agreements was 
recorded as the FDIC loss share receivable 
at the date of acquisition. The fair value 
of the FDIC loss share receivable/payable
 was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. 

 Acquired loans were aggregated into separate pools based upon common risk characteristics. Each pool is considered a unit 
of account and the cash flows expected to be collected, credit 
losses and other relevant information are developed for each 
pool. A summary of the accounting treatment related to changes in credit losses on each loan pool and the related FDIC loss 
share asset follows. 
  If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is increased: 

 
o The reduction in the net present value of the loan pool is recognized immediately as provision expense and an 
increase to the ALLL. 
o The FDIC loss share asset is increased by 80% 
of the adjustment to the ALLL through income. 
  If the estimated credit loss on a loan pool is reduced: 
 
o If the loan pool has an allowance, the allowance is first reduced to $0 (and 80% of this reduction decreases the 
FDIC loss share asset) through income. 
o If the loan pool does not have an allowance (or it is first reduced to $0 and there remains additional expected 
cash flows), the excess of expected cash flows is recogniz
ed as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected 
life of the loan. 
o The decrease in expected reimbursement from the FDIC 
is recognized in income prospectively using a level 
yield methodology over the remaini
ng life of the loss share agreements. 
o The increase in the amount expected to be paid to the FDIC as a result of the aggregate loss calculation is 

recognized prospectively in proportio
n to expected loan income over the remaining life of the loss share 
agreements.  
 The accounting treatment for securities acquire
d from the FDIC is summarized below:  
  Prior to the recognition of OTTI on a security acquired from the FDIC: 
 o The purchase discount established at
 acquisition is accreted into income 
over the expected life of the underlying securities using a level yield methodology. 
o Changes to the expected life of the securities are reco
gnized with a cumulative adjustment to the accretion 
recognized.   Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, which is determined us
ing the same methodology that is applied to securities 
that were not acquired from the FDIC, an increase in expe
cted cash flows is recognized as a yield adjustment over 
the remaining expected life of the security based 
on an evaluation of the nature of the increase. 
     
38 
  The income statement effect of the abov
e items is offset by the applicable loss share percentage in FDIC loss share 
income, net, which cumulatively resulte
d in a liability of $235 million as of
 December 31, 2014. Subsequent to 
September 30, 2014, any OTTI will not be offset 
with the expiration of commercial loss sharing. 
  Securities acquired from the FDIC are classified as AFS and 
carried at fair market value. The changes in unrealized 
gains/losses (down to the contractually 
specified amount) are offset
 by the applicable loss share percentage in AOCI, 
which resulted in a liability of $330
 million as of December 31, 2014. 
  BB&T would only owe these amounts to the FDIC if BB&T were
 to sell these securities prio
r to the end of the third 
quarter of 2017. BB&T has no current in
tent to dispose of the securities. 
 The following table prov

   The decrease in the carrying amount attributable to loans acqui
red from the FDIC was due to the receipt of cash from the 
FDIC, negative accretion due to credit loss improvement and the 
offset to the provision for loans acquired from the FDIC, 
which was a benefit for the current year. The change in the ca
rrying amount attributable to the aggregate loss calculation is 
primarily due to accretion of the expected payment, which is 
included in ﬁAccretion due to credit loss improvementﬂ below. 
The fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow methodol
ogy that is consistent with the acquisition date methodology. 
The fair value attributable to acquired lo
ans and the aggregate loss calculation change
s over time due to the receipt of cash 
from the FDIC, updated credit loss assumptions and the passage 
of time. The fair value attributable to securities acquired 
from the FDIC is based upon the timing and amount that would be payable to the FDIC should they settle at the current fair 

value at the conclusion of the gain sharing period.

e/payable. The table excludes all amount

 2014 compared to 2013 
 Interest income for 2014 on loans and securities acquired from 
the FDIC decreased $185 milli
on compared to 2013, primarily 
due to lower average acquired loan balances. The yield on acquired loans for 2014 was 17.22% compared to 16.93% in 2013. 
At December 31, 2014, the accretable yield balance on acquired loans was $3
78 million. Accretable yield represents the 
excess of expected future cash flows above the current net ca
rrying amount of loans and will be recognized in income over 
the remaining life of the loans. 

 During 2014, BB&T increased
 the accretable yield balance on loans acquired fro
m the FDIC by $116 mi
llion, compared to a 
$107 million increase in 2013, primarily due to improved lo
ss results. These adjustments are recognized on a prospective 
basis over the remaining lives of the loan pools. Loans acquired from FDIC have experienced better performance than 

originally anticipated, which has resulted in the recognition of additional interest income on a level yield basis over the 
expected life of the corresponding loans. A significant portion of 
this increase in interest income is offset by a reduction in
 noninterest income recorded in
 FDIC loss share income.  
 
The provision for loans acquired from the FDIC was a benefit of $29 million in 2014, compared to a provision of $5 million 
for 2013, which reflects improvements in credit quality on acquired loans.  

 FDIC loss share income, net, was $50 million worse than 2013, 
primarily due to a $29 million change in the offset to the 
provision for covered loans and $21 million higher nega
tive accretion related to credit losses on covered loans. 
 
2013 compared to 2012 
 
Interest income for 2013 on loans and securities acquired from 
the FDIC decreased $349 milli
on compared to 2012, primarily 
due to lower average acquired loan balances. The yield on acquired loans for 2013 was 16.93% compared to 18.91% in 2012. 

At December 31, 2013, the accretable yield balance on acquired loans was $5
38 million. Accretable yield represents the 
excess of expected future cash flows above the current net ca
rrying amount of loans and will be recognized in income over 
the remaining life of the acquired loans. 

 
During 2013, BB&T increased
 the accretable yield balance on loans acquired fro
m the FDIC by $107 mi
llion, compared to a 
$72 million reduction in 2012, primarily due to improved loss results in 2013 and changes in the expected lives of the 

underlying loans in 2012. These adjustments are recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining lives of the loan pools. 
 The provision for loans acquired from the FDIC was $5 million 
in 2013, a decrease of $8 million compared to 2012. This 
decrease resulted from the qu
arterly reassessment process. 
 
FDIC loss share income, net, was $25 million better than 20
12, primarily due to securities duration adjustments that 
increased the expected lives of securitie
s in 2013, compared to duration adjustments that shortened the lives in 2012. 
 
FTE Net Interest Income and Rate / Volume Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the major components of net interest income and the related yields and rates, as well as the 
variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes. Changes attributable to the mix 

of assets and liabilities have been allocated proportionally betw
een the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

  Provision for Credit Losses 
 2014 compared to 2013 
 The provision for credit losses was $251 million in 2014, a d
ecrease of $341 million compared to
 the prior year. The decrease 
in the provision for credit losses reflects continued improvement in credit trends and outlook, as net charge-offs in 2014 
decreased 32.1% compared to the prior year. Improving credit cond
itions also resulted in an increase in the ratio of the ALLL 
to net charge-offs, which increased to 2.74x for 2014, compared to 2.19x for 2013.  
 During 2014, approximately $550 million of residential mortgage loans that were primarily performing TDRs and 
approximately $140 million of residential mortgage loans that were primarily nonperforming were sold at a pre-tax gain of 
$42 million and $24 million, respectively. Both of these gain
s were recognized as a reduc
tion to the provision for credit 
losses.  Net charge-offs were 0.46% of average loans and leases held 
for investment for 2014, compar
ed to 0.69% of average loans 
and leases held for investment during 2013. Net charge-offs d
eclined $254 million, or 32.1%, with improvement across most 
loan portfolios led by commercial and industrial loans, which declined $112 million compared to 2013. Net charge-offs in 

other lending subsidiaries were $15 million higher primarily 
due to a process change that
 resulted in the accelerated 
recognition of charge-offs in the nonprime automobile lending portfolio. 
 2013 compared to 2012 
 
The provision for credit losses was $592 million in 2013, a d
ecrease of $465 million compared to
 the prior year. The decrease 
in the provision for credit losses reflected continued improvem
ent in credit trends and outlook, as net charge-offs in 2013 
decreased 38.8% compared to the prior year. Improving credit cond
itions also resulted in an increase in the ratio of the ALLL 
to net charge-offs, which increased to 2.19x for 2013, compared to 1.56x for 2012.  
 Net charge-offs were 0.69% of average loans and leases held
 for investment during 2013, co
mpared to 1.17% of average 
loans and leases held for investment during 2012. Net char
ge-offs decreased in nearly a
ll loan portfolios, including 
significant decreases in the CRE-construction and development, CRE-income producing properties and direct retail lending 

portfolios.  
 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income is a significant contributor to BB&T™s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources 
of revenue to further reduce BB&T™s reliance on traditional spread
-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a
 relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

 2014 compared to 2013 
 Noninterest income was $3.8 billion for 2014, a decline of 3.9% 
compared to 2013. This decrease was driven by declines in 

mortgage banking income, FDIC loss share income, net securities gains and other income, partially offset by growth in 
insurance income.  
 
Income from BB&T™s insurance agency/brokerage operations 
was the largest source of n
oninterest income in 2014. 
Insurance income was a record $1.6 billion, up $126 million co
mpared to 2013, as increased volume and improving market 
conditions drove broad-based increases across the insurance bu
siness. This growth was led by a $95 million increase in 
property and casualty commissions and a $17 million increase in contingent insurance commissions.  
 Mortgage banking income totaled $395 million in 2014, a decrease of $170 million, or 30.1%, compared to the prior year. 
The decrease in mortgage banking income includes a $182 million decrease in residential mortgage production revenues 
primarily due to decreases in the volume and margins on loan sales, which have come under pressure due to increased 

competition and sustained low interest rates. The decline also 
reflects an $18 million reduction in fees primarily due to a 
reduction in volume. These declines were partially offset by in
creased servicing income due to 
a larger servicing portfolio as 
well as an increase in derivative income.  

 Net securities gains declined $54 million as the prior year 
contained a $46 million gain on the sale of GNMA securities. 
FDIC loss share income, net, was $50 million worse than 2013, 
primarily due to a $29 million change in the offset to the 
provision for covered loans, which was a benefit in 2014 
due to improved credit quality on the acquired loans.  
 Trust and investment advisory revenues increased $21 million to a record $221 million, primarily the result of higher 

investment advisory revenues during the current year. Other income decreased $60 million in 2014 compared to 2013, 
primarily due to a $31 million gain on the sale of a consumer
 lending subsidiary in 2013, a $24 million decrease in income 
from assets related to certain post-employment benefits, which is
 offset in personnel expense, and an $8 million decrease in 
letter of credit fees. These declines and other smaller declines 
were partially offset by an increase of $19 million related to
 affordable housing investments, primaril
y due to decreased impairment, and a $19 million increase in leasing income.  
 2013 compared to 2012 
 Noninterest income was $3.9 billion for 2013, up 3.1% compared
 to 2012. This increase was driven by strong results from 
BB&T™s insurance, investment banking and brokerage, bankcard fees and merchant discounts, and trust and investment 

advisory LOBs, along with strong growth in
 checkcard fees and steady growth in serv
ice charges on deposits. This growth in 
noninterest income was negatively impacted by a decrease in mortgage banking income.  
 Income from the insurance agency/brokerage operations was the largest source of noninterest income in 2013. Insurance 

income was up 11.6% compared to 2012, with approximately one
-half of the growth attributable to the acquisition of Crump 
Insurance during April 2012, and the remainder primarily the result of an improving market for insurance premiums and a 

$13 million experience-based refund of reinsurance premiums that was received in the second quarter of 2013.  

 Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased $18 million, or 4.9%, compared to 2012. This increase 
was largely driven by higher investment commission income an
d increased investment banking activities. Bankcard fees and 
merchant discounts increased $20 million, or 8.5%, in 2013, based on higher retail and commercial bankcard transaction 
volumes and an increase in merchant discount income. Trust 
and investment advisory revenues increased $16 million, 
primarily the result of higher investment advisory revenues during the current year. Checkcard fees were $14 million higher 
than the prior year, an increase of 7.6%, reflecting increased tr
ansaction volume, a portion of which is attributable to the 
acquisition of BankAtlantic in the prior year. Service charge
s totaled $584 million, an increase of $18 million, or 3.2%, 
compared to 2012, reflecting gr
owth in cash management products, an increase 
in other deposit fees and the impact of the 
BankAtlantic acquisition. 
     
43 
 Mortgage banking income totaled $565 million in 2013, a decrease of $275 million, or 32.7%, compared to the prior year. 
The decrease in mortgage banking income includes a $247 million decrease in residential mortgage production revenues and 
a $61 million decrease in net MSR and related hedge valuation ad
justments compared to the prior year. These decreases were 
partially offset by a $12 million increase in residential mortga
ge servicing revenues, which pr
imarily reflects growth in the 
servicing portfolio, and a $28 million decrease in the amortizati
on of MSRs that was primarily driven by slower prepayment 
speeds. The decrease in residential mortgage production revenues
 primarily resulted from lower gain on sale margins, which 
reflects increased competition and a higher proportion of loans 
originated through the correspo
ndent network. The weighted 
average gain on sale margin for 2013 was 1.15%, a 49.2% 
decline compared to the prio
r year. Correspondent loan 
originations represented 65.1% of mortgage loan originations in 2013, compared to 60.5% of mortgage loan originations in 

2012.  
 FDIC loss share income, net reflects accr
etion of the FDIC loss share receivable 
due to credit loss improvement (including 
expense associated with the aggregate lo
ss calculation) and accretion related to
 securities acquired from FDIC, partially 
reduced by the offset to the provision for loans acquired from FDIC. Loans acquired from FDIC have experienced better 

performance than originally anticipated, which has resulted in 
the recognition of additional interest income on a level yield 
basis over the expected life of the corresponding loans. A significa
nt portion of this increase in interest income is offset by
 a reduction in noninterest income recorded in FDIC loss share income. For 2013, noninterest income was reduced by $255 

million related to improvement in loan performance compared to a reduction of $271 million in 2012. These decreases in 
income were partially offset by increases of $4 million and $11 million, respectively, which reflected 80% of the provision 
for credit losses recorded on loans acquired from FDIC for 2013 and 2012. 

 Net securities gains were $51 million during 2013, compared to $12 million of net securities losses in 2012. Other income 
increased $63 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a $31 million gain on the sale of a consumer lending 

subsidiary in 2013, a $22 million increase in income from oper
ating leases and a $21 million increase in income from assets 
related to certain post-employment benefits, which is offset in 
personnel expense. These increases were partially offset by a 
$10 million decrease in client derivative related activities.

2014 compared to 2013
  Personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest e
xpense and includes salaries, wages and incentives, as well as 
pension and other employee benefit costs. Personnel expense to
taled $3.2 billion, a decrease of $113 million compared to 
2013. This decline was driven by a $110 million reduction in qualified pension plan expense, primarily due to a higher 

expected return on plan assets and a change in the actuarial discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation a
s of the beginning of the year that resulted in reduced amortization expense during 2014.  

     
44 
 Professional services expense totaled $139 million, a decrease of
 $50 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was 
driven by a reduction in legal fees as well as services associated with regulatory initiatives. Regulatory charges totaled $106
 million for 2014, a decline of $37 million compared to 2013, which primarily reflects a reduction in FDIC insurance due to 
current and prior year long-term debt issuances and improved credit conditions.  
 Loan-related expense totaled $342 million for 2014, an increas
e of $87 million compared to the prior year. This increase 
includes a $33 million mortgage loan indemnification reserve 
adjustment, which represents an
 increase in estimated losses 
that may be incurred on FHA-insured mortgage loans that have not yet defaulted, and a mortgage reserve adjustment of $27 

million related to a review of mortgage lending processes.   

 Outside IT services totaled $115 million during 2014, compared
 to $89 million for 2013. This increase was due to third-party 
costs associated with the new ERP 
and commercial loan systems.   
 A loss on early extinguishment of debt of $122 million was reco
rded during 2014 in connection with the early termination of 
$1.1 billion of higher cost FHLB advances. The transaction occurred during the third quarter and had a beneficial impact to 
net interest income for the remainder of the year.  
 
Other expense was $884 million for 2014, an increase of $73 million, or 9.0%, compared to 2013. During the second quarter 
of 2014, BB&T was notified that its FHA-insured loan originati
on process would be the subject of an audit survey by the 
HUD-OIG. While there are no findings at this time, in light of
 announcements made by other financial institutions related to 
the outcomes of similar audits and related matters and afte
r further review of the exposure, an $85 million reserve was 
established related to BB&T™s FHA-insured loan origination process. The increase in other expense also includes a $17 
million increase in depreciation related to 
operating leases. These increases were pa
rtially offset by a $15 million favorable 
franchise tax adjustment and a decline in expense due to the prior year $11 million write-down of owned real estate.  
 2013 compared to 2012 

 Personnel expense totaled $3.3 billion in 2013, an increase of
 $168 million, or 5.4%, compared to 2012. The increase in 
personnel expense includes an increase of $128 million in sa
laries and wages, which reflects increases related to the 
acquisitions of Crump Insurance and BankAtlantic during 2012
 and the impact of normal salary increases and job class 
changes. Other personnel expenses increased approximately $40 million, which included an increase of $22 million in post-
employment benefits expense that is offset in other income. The remainder of the increase in other personnel expenses was 
driven by smaller increases in employment taxes and other fringe benefits. 
 
Occupancy and equipment expense increased $42 million, or 6.
5%, compared to 2012, with 
a portion of this increase 
attributable to the acquisitions of Crump Insurance and Bank
Atlantic acquisitions in the prior year and the remainder 
attributable to increases in rent and 
IT-related depreciation and maintenance.  
 Professional services expense totaled $189 million, an increase 
of $33 million compared to the prior year. This increase was 
largely driven by costs associated with 
systems and project-related expenses, partially
 offset by a decrease in legal fees.  
 
Other expense increased $27 million, or 3.1%, compared to 2012, primarily the result of higher project-related expenses, 
increased depreciation expense related to assets used in the equipment finance leasing business and lower of cost or fair value
 adjustments on certain owned real estate. 
These increases were partially offset by 
a decrease in advertising and marketing 
expenses, lower insurance-related expenses and the loss on the sale
 of a leveraged lease that wa
s recorded in the prior year. 
Software expense increased $20 million compared to the pr
ior year, which primarily reflects higher maintenance and 
depreciation expense.  Foreclosed property expense includes the gain or loss on sa
le of foreclosed property, valuation adjustments resulting from 
updated appraisals and the ongoing expense of maintaining foreclosed properties. Foreclosed property expense decreased 
$211 million, or 79.3% in 2013, due to fewer losses and write-downs and lower maintenance costs on foreclosed property. 
Loan-related expense totaled $255 million, a decrease of $28 million, or 9.9% compared to the prior year. This decrease was 
primarily the result of improvements in mortgage repurchase ex
pense and lower costs associated with certain mortgage loan 
indemnifications. 
 Merger-related and restructuring charges 
were $22 million lower than the prior year, which reflects the impact of merger-
related charges associated with the Crump Insurance and BankA
tlantic acquisitions in the prior year, partially offset by 
restructuring charges associated with optimization activities in Community Banking that were initiated during the second 

quarter of 2013. Regulatory charges decreased $16 million in 2013 due to improved credit quality, which led to lower deposit 
insurance premiums. 
    
45 
  Provision for Income Taxes  
 
BB&T™s provision for income taxes totaled $760 million, 
$1.4 billion and $764 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, 
respectively. BB&T™s effective tax rates for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 25.5%, 44.7% and 27.4%, 

respectively.  
 The decrease in the effective tax rate fo
r 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to prior year adjustments totaling $516 
million related to uncertain tax positions. During 2013, the U.S.
 Court of Federal Claims denied BB&T™s refund claim related 
to the IRS™s disallowance of tax deductions and foreign tax cr
edits taken in connection with a financing transaction entered 
into by BB&T in 2002. BB&T has appealed this ruling. The decr
ease in the effective tax rate also reflects a net $36 million 
benefit recorded during 2014 as a result of developments in the IRS™s examination of tax years 2008-2010. 

 BB&T has extended credit to and invested in the obligations of states and municipalities and their agencies and has made 

other investments and loans that produce tax-exempt income. The income generated from these investments, together with 
certain other transactions that have favorable tax treatment, have reduced BB&T™s overall effective tax rate from the statutory
 rate in all periods presented.

rate to the statutory tax rate and a discussion 
of uncertain tax positions and other tax matters.

ﬁNoninterest Incomeﬂ 
and ﬁNoninterest Expenseﬂ sections above. 

 2014 compared to 2013 
  Community Banking 
  Community Banking had a network of 1,839 banking offices at the end of 2014, an increase of 14 offices compared to 
December 31, 2013. The incr
ease in offices was primarily driven by the acquis
ition of 21 branches in Texas, partially offset 
by the closure of certain lower volume branches. 
 Community Banking net income was $923 million in 2014, an increase of $32 million, or 3.6%, compared to 2013.  
 
Segment net interest income totaled $2.9 billion, a decrease of 
$134 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower yields 
on new loans and lower funding spreads earned on deposits, partially offset by loan and noninterest-bearing deposit growth.  

 
The allocated provision for credit losses 
decreased $156 million driven by lower business and consumer loan charge-offs, 
partially offset by a stabilization in loss factors.  
 
Noninterest income of $1.2 billion increased $18 million, primarily due to higher service charges on deposits and bankcard 
fees.   
Noninterest expense totaled $1.5 billion for 2014. The $157 milli
on decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel, 
occupancy and equipment, professional services and regulatory expense.  

 Intersegment net referral fees decreased $60 million driven by lower mortgage banking referrals.  
 
Allocated corporate expenses increased $96 million driven pr
imarily by internal business initiatives, including the ongoing 
implementation of the ERP system.  

 
During the second quarter of 2014, BB&T completed the acquisitio
n of 21 branches in Texas, which included $1.2 billion in 
deposits and $112 million in loans. 
      
46 
 During 2014, BB&T also announced that it reached agreements
 to acquire additional branches in Texas, The Bank of 
Kentucky Financial Corporation, and Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. 
 
Residential Mortgage Banking 
  
Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $204 million in 
2014, a decrease of $179 milli
on, or 46.7%, compared to 
2013.  
 Mortgage originations totaled $17.4 billion in 2014, a decrea
se of $14.2 billion compared to $31.6 billion in 2013. BB&T™s 
residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes both retained loans and loans serviced for others, totaled $122.3 
billion at the end of 2014, compared to $121.2 billion at December 31, 2013.  
 Segment net interest income decreased $87 million to $498 million, primarily the result of lower average loan balances. 
  
The allocated provision for credit losses wa
s a benefit of $107 million in 2014, compared to expense of $12 million in 2013, 
reflecting the benefit of the previously discussed sales of resi
dential mortgages in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and 
a decrease in loan balances consistent with the current st
rategy of selling substantially all conforming mortgage loan 
production. 

 Noninterest income decreased $174 million driven by lower gain
s on residential mortgage loan production and sales due to 
lower origination volume and tighter pricing due to competitive f
actors. This decrease 
was partially offset by an increase in 
net servicing income of $31 million, primarily due to slower pr
epayment speeds and a $2.8 billion, or 3.2%, increase in the 
investor-owned servicing portfolio.  

 Noninterest expense increased $134 million, which primarily reflects a $27 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 
related to the previously discussed ongoing review of mortgage processes, as well as adjustments in the second quarter of 

2014 totaling $118 million related to the previously described FHA-insured loan exposures. 
 The provision for income taxes decreased $111 million, primarily due to lower pre-tax income. 

  Dealer Financial Services 
  
Dealer Financial Services net income was $183 million in 2014
, a decrease of $21 million, or
 10.3%, compar
ed to 2013.  
 The allocated provision for credit losses
 increased $23 million primarily due to higher charge-offs in the nonprime 
automobile loan portfolio as credit trends 
in that portfolio continue to normalize. 
 
Noninterest expense increased $8 million, driven by higher personnel expense, primarily related to Regional Acceptance 
Corporation™s geographic expansion and operating charge-offs.  
 
Dealer Financial Services grew 
average loans by $1.1 billion, or 10.5%, compared to 2013 as the result of strong growth in 
the prime and nonprime auto lending businesses.
 
  
Specialized Lending 
  
Specialized Lending net income was $254 million in 2014, a decrease of $16 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2013.  

 Segment net interest income decreased $120 million to $432 million, which primarily reflects the sale of a consumer lending 
subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2013 and lower credit spreads on loans earned during 2014. 

 The sale of the specialized lending subsidiary also had a benefi
cial impact on the allocated provision for credit losses, which
 decreased $46 million.  

 Noninterest income increased $10 million driven by higher operating lease income.  

 Noninterest expense decreased $36 million driven by lower pe
rsonnel, occupancy and equipment, loan processing and 
professional services expense.  

 Small ticket consumer finance, equipment finance, governmental finance and commercial mortgage experienced strong 
growth compared to 2013. 
    
47 
   Insurance Services 
  Insurance Services net income was $233 million in 2014, an
 increase of $46 million, or 
24.6%, compared to 2013.  
 
Insurance Services™ noninterest income of $1.7 billion increased $128 million, primarily due to increased commissions on 

new and renewal property and casualty business, higher performance-based commissions and an increase in employee benefit 
commissions.  
 
Noninterest expense increased $54 million driven by higher sa
laries, performance-based incentives, operating charge-offs and 
business referral expense. 

  Financial Services 
  Financial Services net income was $280 million in 2014, a decrease of $23 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2013.  
 The allocated provision for credit losses increased $7 million 
compared to the prior year as the result of growth in the 
Corporate Banking and BB&T Wealth loan portfolios. 
 Noninterest income increased $26 million, primarily due to higher trust, investment advisory and investment banking income. 

Client invested assets totaled $119.0 billi
on as of December 31, 2014, an increase of 
$7.8 billion, or 7.0%
, compared to 2013. 
 
Noninterest expense increased $28 million, primarily due to higher personnel expense, operating charge-offs, sub-advisory 

fees and occupancy and equipment expense.  
 Allocated corporate expenses increased $21 million, primarily
 driven by internal business initiatives and growth in the 
segment. 
 Financial Services continues to generate significant loan growth through expanded lending strategies, with Corporate 

Banking™s average loan balances increasing $1.7 billion, or 23.3%, compared to 2013, while BB&T Wealth™s average loan 
balances increased $229 million, or 25.6%. BB&T Wealth also grew transaction account balances by $438 million, or 18.8%, 
and money market and savings balances by $575 million, or 9.4%, compared to 2013. 
  Other, Treasury & Corporate 
  Other, Treasury & Corporate net income was $149 million in 2014 co
mpared to a net loss of $509 million in 2013. Results in 
the prior year include $516 million in adjustments for un
certain income tax positions as previously described.  
 
Segment net interest income increased $103 million to $401 million, primarily due to an increase in the investment portfolio, 
lower funding credits on deposits allocated to Community Banking and Financial Services and lower corporate borrowing 

costs, partially offset by runoff in the acquired from FDIC loan portfolio.  
 The allocated provision for credit losses wa
s a benefit of $66 million compared to a benefit of $16 million in the prior year. 

This current year includes a $29 million benefit for loans acquired from the FDIC and a $29 million reduction in the reserve 
for unfunded lending commitments driven by improvements related to the mix of lines of credit, letters of credit, and 
bankers™ acceptances. 

 Noninterest income decreased $159 million primarily due to lo
wer securities gains in the investment portfolio, lower FDIC 
loss share income, the sale of a consumer lending subsidiary du
ring the fourth quarter of 2013 and lower income from assets 
related to certain post-employment benefits. 

 Noninterest expense increased $68 million, primarily due to $122 million in expense related to early extinguishment of 
FHLB debt, and higher outside IT servi
ces and merger-related expense, partially
 offset by lower personnel, professional 
services and tax and license expense. 
 Intersegment net referral fee expense decreased $61 million as th
e result of a lower level of mortgage banking referral income 
that was allocated to both Community Banking and Financial Services. 
     
48 
 The credit for allocated corporate expens
es increased $150 million compared to
 the prior year primarily related to 
investments in application systems and business initiatives allo
cated to the other segments and centralization of certain 
business activities into corporate functions to allow for efficiencies. 
 2013 compared to 2012 
  
Community Banking 
  
Community Banking had a network of 1,825 banking offices at the end of 2013, a decrease of seven offices compared to 

December 31, 2012. The decrease in offices wa
s driven by the closure of low volume 
branches, partially offset by de novo 
branch openings.  

 Community Banking net income was $891 million in 2013, an
 increase of $173 million, or 24.1%, compared to 2012. 
  Segment net interest income totaled $3.0 billion, a decrease of $185 million compared to 2012. The decrease in segment net 
interest income was primarily attributable to lower funding sp
reads earned on deposits, partially offset by improvements in 
deposit mix as a result of growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, money market and savings deposits and a decrease in 
certificates of deposits.  
 The allocated provision for loan
 and lease losses decreased $307 million as th
e result of lower business and consumer loan 
charge-offs.  
 Noninterest income of $1.2 billion increased $60 million, primarily due to higher checkcard fees, bankcard fees, merchant 

discounts and service charges on deposits.  
 Noninterest expense of $1.7 billion decreased $123 million, pr
imarily driven by lower foreclosed property, regulatory and 
professional services expense.  
  Residential Mortgage Banking 
  Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $383 million in 201
3, a decrease of $6 million, or 1.5%, compared to 2012.  
 
Mortgage originations totaled $31.6 billion in 2013, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 4.5%, compared to $33.1 billion in 2012. 
BB&T™s residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which includes both retained loans and loans serviced for others, totaled 

$121.2 billion at the end of 
2013, compared to 
$110.1 billion at D
ecember 31, 2012.  
  
Segment net interest income increased $65 million to $585 million. The increase in segment net interest income was driven 

by growth in loans held for investment, which was partially attr
ibutable to the decision to begin retaining certain originated 
mortgage loans, and higher credit 
spreads on average loan balances. 
  
The allocated provision for loan
 and lease losses decreased $162 million, primarily reflecting an improvement in mix due to 
the runoff of lower quality loans. Net charge-offs of $78 milli
on were recorded in 2013, compared to $133 million in 2012, as 
nonaccrual and aged loans (excluding guar
anteed loans) decreased during the period. 
  Noninterest income decreased $272 million, primarily driven 
by lower gain on sale margins, which reflects increased 
competition and a higher proportion of loans originated thro
ugh the correspondent network,
 and a decrease in net MSR 
valuation adjustments. 

  Noninterest expense decreased $46 million primarily due to lowe
r foreclosure-related expense and lower expense associated 
with mortgage repurchase reserves. 
  Dealer Financial Services 
  
Dealer Financial Services net income was $204 million in 2013, a decrease of $15 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2012. 

  Segment net interest income of $676 million increased $27 mi
llion, primarily the result of loan growth and wider credit 
spreads in the Regional Acceptance Corpora
tion portfolio. Dealer Financial Services average loans grew by $840 million, or 
8.5%, compared to 2012. 

      
49 
 The allocated provision for loan
 and lease losses increased $50 million, primar
ily due to a more normalized volume of 
charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance Corp
oration portfolio after experiencing a lo
wer charge-off volume in the prior year. 
  Specialized Lending 
  
Specialized Lending net income was $270 million in 2013, an increase of $33 million, or 13.9%, compared to 2012. 

  Segment net interest income of $552 million decreased $10 mi
llion compared to 2012. During the fourth quarter, BB&T sold 
a consumer lending subsidiary that focused its business on the nonprime consumer market. The sale of this subsidiary 
included loans totaling approximately $500 million. In connectio
n with this sale transaction, loans totaling approximately 
$230 million were transferred to Residential Mortgage Banking.  

 Excluding this sales transaction, Specialized Lending grew average balances by $966 million, or 6.9%, over 2012. This 
increase was primarily driven by growth in small ticket co
nsumer finance, commercial in
surance premium finance and 
equipment finance. 
  The allocated provision for loan and lease losses decreased $50 
million, which primarily reflects the removal of reserves in 
connection with the loan sales an
d transfers previously discussed. Loss rates are 
also affected by shifts in the portfolio mix 
of 
the underlying subsidiaries. 

  
Insurance Services 
  
Insurance Services net income was $187 million in 2013, an increase of $44 million, or 30.8%, compared to 2012. 

 Noninterest income was $1.5 billion, an increase of $170 m
illion compared to 2012. The increase reflects the acquisition of 
Crump Insurance during April 2012, firming market conditions for insurance premiums, organic growth in wholesale and 
retail property and casualty insurance op
erations, wholesale life insurance growth
 and an experience-based refund of 
reinsurance premiums totaling $13 million that was received du
ring the second quarter of 
2013. Wholesale property and 
casualty insurance income increased $59 million, while retail 
property and casualty insurance 
income increased $36 million 
compared to 2012. Wholesale life insurance income increased $43 million compared to 2012, primarily attributable to the 
Crump Insurance acquisition. 
  Higher noninterest income growth was offset by a $119 million 
increase in noninterest expense, 
primarily the result of higher 
salary costs and performance-based incentives. The increase in noninterest expense was partially attributable to the Crump 
Insurance acquisition in 2012. 
  Financial Services 
  Financial Services net income was $303 million in 2013, an increase of $26 million, or 9.4%, compared to 2012. 
  
Segment net interest income for Financial Services increased 
$13 million to $448 million in 2013. The increase in segment 
net interest income during 2013 was primarily attributable to strong organic loan growth and an improved deposit mix, 

partially offset by lower NIM.  

 Corporate Banking™s average loan balances incr
eased by $1.6 billion, or 26.5%, in 2013.  
  The allocated provision for loan and lease losses increased $7 million, primarily attributable to lower reserves in 2012 
resulting from improved credit trends in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 
  
Noninterest income for Financial Services increased $20 million, primarily due to higher investment banking and brokerage 
fees and commissions and trust and investment advisory revenu
es. Client invested assets totaled $111.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2013, an increase of $15.0 
billion, or 15.6%, 
compared to 2012. 
  Noninterest expense incurred by Financia
l Services decreased $25 million, primarily due to lower occupancy and equipment 
expense and an operating charge-off in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in personnel expense. 
      
50 
 Other, Treasury & Corporate 
  Net income in Other, Treasury & Corporat
e can vary due to changing needs of 
the Company, including the size of the 
investment portfolio, the need for wholesal
e funding, income received from derivatives
 used to hedge the balance sheet and, 
in certain cases, income associated with acquisition activities. 

  
Other, Treasury & Corporate generated a net loss of $509 million in 2013, compared to net income of $45 million in the prior 
year. The net loss was primarily the result of $516 million in adjustments for uncertain income tax positions as previously 
described.  

 Segment net interest income decreased $153 million to $298 milli
on, primarily attributable to runoff of loans acquired from 
the FDIC.  

 The $136 million increase in noninterest income primarily reflects the gain on the sale of a consumer lending subsidiary 

totaling $31 million, higher income from assets related to certain post-employment benefits, higher securities gains in the 
investment portfolio and higher FDIC loss share income.  
 
The $84 million increase in noninterest expense was primarily 
attributable to personnel expense related to certain post-
employment benefits mentioned above, as well as higher professi
onal services, data processing software, and IT professional 
services expense related to corporate project initiatives. 

 Analysis of Financial Condition 
 Investment Activities  
 BB&T™s board-approved investment policy is carried out by 
the MRLCC, which meets regular
ly to review the economic 
environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC al
so has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in 
the ﬁMarket Risk Managementﬂ section in ﬁManagement™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 

Operationsﬂ herein. 

 Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and 
anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall inte
rest rate sensitivity of the Company. In general, the goals 
of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan 

fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to pr
ovide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposit
s as prescribed by law and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn the 
maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with 
meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii). 

 
Branch Bank invests in securities allowable under bank regu
lations. These securities may include obligations of the U.S. 
Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including MBS), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, 

non-agency MBS, structured notes, bank el
igible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, 
negotiable CDs, bankers acceptances, mutual 
funds and limited types of equity secur
ities. Branch Bank also may deal in 
securities subject to the provisions of the Gr
amm-Leach-Bliley Act. BB&T™
s full-service brokerage and investment banking 
subsidiary engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equ
ity and debt securities subject to the risk management policies
 of the Company.

   The securities portfolio totaled $41.1 billi
on at December 31, 2014, an increase of $94
2 million, or 2.3%, over the prior year.
 The increase was driven by higher HTM portfolio balances in response to new regulatory requirements related to liquidity. 
As of December 31, 2014, approximately 14.0% of the securitie
s portfolio was variable rate, compared to 14.7% as of 
December 31, 2013. The effective duration of
 the securities portfolio was 3.9 years at
 December 31, 2014, compared to 5.5 
years at the end of 2013. The duration of the securities portfolio
 excludes equity securities, au
ction rate securities, and cer
tain 
non-agency MBS acquired from the FDIC. 

 MBS issued by GSEs were 71.1% of the total securities portfolio 
at year-end 2014, compared to 73.5% as of prior year end. 
As of December 31, 2014, the AFS securities portfolio also in
cludes $1.2 billion of securities that were acquired from the 
FDIC as part of the Colonial acquisition. Effective Octobe
r 1, 2014, securities subject to the commercial loss sharing 
agreement with the FDIC related to the Colonial acquisition were
 no longer subject to loss sharing; however, any gains on the 
sale of these securities through September 30, 2017 would be sh
ared with the FDIC. Since these securities are in a significant 
unrealized gain position, they are effec
tively covered as any declines in the unrealized gains of the securities down to a 
contractually specified amount wo
uld reduce the liability to the FDIC at the applicable percentage. Securities acquired from 
the FDIC consisted of $931 million of no
n-agency MBS and $312 million of munici
pal securities as of
 December 31, 2014. 
 
During 2014, securities totaling $1.3 billion were sold for a net 
realized gain of $3 million. During 2013, $2.2 billion of 
securities were sold that produced a net realized gain of $51 mi
llion. During 2012, $306 million of securities were sold for a 
net realized loss of $3 million. In addition, BB&T recognize
d $6 million in OTTI charges for 2014 and $9 million in OTTI 
charges for 2012.

For purposes of the maturity table, MBS, 
which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity 
groupings based on the 
contractual maturity. The expected life of MB

 Lending Activities  
 The primary goal of the BB&T lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan 

products that are fair to the client and profitable to the Company. Management believes that this purpose can best be 
accomplished by building strong, pr
ofitable client relationships over time, with
 BB&T becoming an impo
rtant contributor to 
the prosperity and well-being of its c
lients. In addition to the importance pl
aced on client know
ledge and continuous 
involvement with clients, BB&T™s lending process incorporates
 the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture 
and an in-depth local market
 knowledge. Furthermore, the Company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the 
degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. In 
this context, BB&T strives to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in its markets while pursuing a balanced 
strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality.

During the first quarter of 2014, $8.3 billion of loans were tr
ansferred from direct retail lending to residential mortgage. 
 
Average loans held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $118.3 billion, down $263 million compared to the 

prior quarter. The decrease in average lo
ans held for investment was primarily due to a decline of $954 million in the 
residential mortgage portfolio and continued run-off of loans acquired from the FDIC. These declines were partially offset by 

a $477 million increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio as well as smaller increases in the CRE Œ construction and 

development, direct retail lending and other lending subsidiaries portfolios. 
 The decrease of $954 million, or 11.8% annualized, in the re
sidential mortgage portfolio reflects the $550 million loan sale 
that occurred during the third quarter, which had a partial impact on third quarter averages and a full impact on fourth quarte
r averages. The decrease also reflects lowe
r origination volume and a reduction in
 fixed rate home equity loans due to 
continued runoff. The previously described $140 million loan 
sale occurred late in the fo
urth quarter and therefore had 
minimal impact on average balances. 
 Average commercial and industr
ial loans increased $477 million, or 4.7% annu
alized, which reflects strong growth from 
large corporate clients. Growth in this sector has benefited from the expansion of BB&T™s footprint into new markets. CRE Œ 
construction and development loans were up 15.2% annualized, re
flecting a continued strong growth trend in that portfolio. 
 The average direct retail lend
ing portfolio increased $173 million, or 8.
7% annualized, while average other lending 
subsidiaries loans increased
 $117 million, or 4.1% on an annualized basis.

The weighted average remaining term for direct retail lending represents the remaining contractual draw period. 
Margin loans totaling $103 million have been excluded 
from the calculation of the weighted average remaining 
term because they do not have a contract

     As of December 31, 2014, approximately 5.3% of the outstanding
 balance of variable rate residential mortgage loans is 
currently in an interest-only phase. Approximately 85.6% of th
ese balances will begin amortizing within the next three years. 
Variable rate residential mortgage loans typically reset every 12
 months beginning after a 3 to 10 year fixed period, with an 
annual cap on rate changes ranging from 2% to 6%.  
 As of December 31, 2014, the direct retail lending portfolio 
includes $5.6 billion of home eq
uity lines. Approximately 67% 
of the outstanding balance of variable rate home equity lines 
is currently in the interest-only phase. Approximately 8.2% of 
these balances will begin scheduled amortization within the next 
three years. Variable rate home
 equity lines typically reset 
on a monthly basis. Variable rate home equity 
loans were immaterial as of December 31, 2014. 
 BB&T monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similar to other consumer loans 
and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determin
ing the necessary ALLL. BB&T al
so receives notification when 
the first lien holder, whether BB&T or another financial in
stitution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the 
borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process 
of foreclosure, BB&T obtains va
luations to determine if any 
additional charge-offs or reserves ar
e warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 
 BB&T has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the 
first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by BB&T
. As a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, BB&T 

estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lie
n is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL to reflect the increased 
risk of loss on these credits. Finally, BB&T also provides add
itional reserves to second lien positions when the estimated 
combined current loan to value ratio for 
the credit exceeds 100%. As of December 31
, 2014, BB&T held or serviced the first 
lien on 37.2% of its second lien positions. 
 
Scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in
 which the payment is due. Determinations of maturities are 
based on contract terms. BB&T™s credit policy typically doe
s not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled 
maturity date (including balloon payment 
date), the customer generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan 
and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.  
 BB&T lends to a diverse customer base that is substantially lo
cated within the Comp
any™s primary market 
area. At the same 
time, the loan portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout
 BB&T™s branch network to mitiga
te concentration risk arising 
from local and regional economic downturns. Refer to the ﬁRisk Managementﬂ section herein for a discussion of each of the 

loan portfolios and the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.

During the first quarter of 2014, $8.3 billion of loans were tr
ansferred from direct retail lending to residential mortgage. 
 
Total loans and leases were $121.3 billion at year-end 2014, an
 increase of $4.2 billion compared to the balance at year-end 
2013. This increase reflects broad-based loan growth, with commercial and industrial up $2.9 billion, sales finance up $1.2 

billion and other lending subsidiaries up $1.0 billion. A declin
e in direct retail lending bala
nces and a corresponding increas
e in residential mortgage balances reflect the impact of an $8.3 billion transfer that occurred during the first quarter of 2014.
   
The increase in commercial and industrial
 loans reflects solid growth from large co
rporate clients, which typically have 
strong credit profiles and therefore put downward pressure on 
pricing. The yield on commercial and industrial loans declined 
to 3.35% in 2014 from 3.63% in 2013.  
 The decline in residential mortgage balances, after excluding the effects of the loan transfer, reflects the competitive 

environment, lower originations and the impact of the loan
s sales previously discussed. Additionally, BB&T implemented a 
mid-year change in strategy that resulted in originations of 
loans with eligible collateral types, including adjustable rate 
mortgages with 10 and 15 year terms, being directed to the LHFS portfolio. 

 The acquired from FDIC loan portfolio, which totaled $1.2 billi
on at December 31, 2014, continued to runoff during the year, 
resulting in a decline of $820 million compared to the prior year-end. 
 The majority of BB&T™s loans are with 
clients in domestic market areas, whic
h are primarily concentrated in the 
southeastern United States. International loans were
 immaterial as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. 
 
The following tables summ
arize the loan portfolio based on
 regulatory classifications, which focuses on the underlying loan 
collateral, and differs from internal cla
ssifications presented herein that focus on the primary purpose of the loan. Acquired 
from FDIC loans are included in
 their respective categories.

   Asset Quality 
 
The following discussion includes assets acquired from the FDIC. Loans acquired from the FDIC, which are considered 
performing due to the application of th
e expected cash flows method
, were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and $2.0 
billion in the prior year. Refer 
to ﬁAcquired from FDIC and FD
IC Loss Share Receivable/Payableﬂ
 in ﬁManagement™s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Op
erationsﬂ herein for additional information. Foreclosed real 
estate acquired from the FDIC totaled $56 million and $121 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
 NPAs, which include foreclosed real estate, repossessions and NP
Ls, totaled $782 million at D
ecember 31, 2014 compared to 
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2013
. The decline in NPAs of $392
 million was driven by decreases of $319 million in NPLs 
and $73 million in foreclosed property. Commercial and 
industrial NPLs were down $124 million due to continued 
improvement in credit quality. Residential mortgage NPLs declined $77 million due to the fourth quarter sale of $121 million 
of residential mortgage NPLs, partially offset by the first qu
arter loan transfer from direct
 retail lending to residential 
mortgage, which included $55 million of NPLs.  
     
57 
 NPAs as a percentage of loans and leases plus foreclosed 
property were 0.65% at December 
31, 2014 compared
 with 1.01% at December 31, 2013. 
 
The following table presents the changes in NPAs during 2014 and 2013 (excludes foreclosed property acquired from the

The following tables summarize asset quality information for th
e past five years. As more fully described below, this 
information has been adjusted to exclude certain components: 

  BB&T has recorded certain amounts related to government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans that BB&T 
has the option, but not the obligation, to repurchase an
d has effectively regained 
control. These amounts are 
reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets but have 
been excluded from the asset quality disclosures, as 
management believes they result in distortion of the reported metrics. The amount of government 

guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans that have been excluded are noted in the footnotes to Table 22. 
  In addition, BB&T has concluded that the inclusion of 
loans acquired from the FDIC in ﬁLoans 90 days or 
more past due and still accruing as a percentage of
 total loans and leasesﬂ may result in significant 
distortion to this ratio. The inclusion of these loans c
ould result in a lack of comparability across quarters or 
years, and could negatively impact comparability with other portfolios that were not impacted by 
acquisition accounting. BB&T believes that the presentation of this asset quality measure excluding loans 

acquired from the FDIC provides additional perspective 
into underlying trends related to the quality of its 
loan portfolio. Accordingly, the asset quality measures
 in Table 23 present asset quality information on a 
consolidated basis as well as ﬁLoans 90 days or more
 past due and still accruing as a percentage of total 
loans and leasesﬂ excluding lo
ans acquired from the FDIC.

2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, ex
cluding government guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans, totaled 
$535 million at December 31, 2014, compar
ed with $722 million at y
ear-end 2013, a decline of 
25.9%. Loans 30-89 days

 GNMA mortgage loans, totaled $896 mi
llion at December 31, 2014, which was a 
decline of $211 million, or 19.1%, compared to prior year. 
These reductions reflect continued improvement in credit quality 
and the effects of the sale of residential mortgage NPLs as previously discussed.

(2) Net charge-offs for 2011 and 2010 include $236 million and $695 million, respectively, related to BB&T™s NPA 
disposition strategy. In connection with this strategy, approxi
mately $271 million and $1.9 billion of problem loans were 
transferred from loans held for investment to LHFS in 2011 
and 2010, respectively. The disposition of all such loans was 
complete as of December 31, 2011. 
(3) These asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove
 the impact of assets acquired from the FDIC. Appropriate 
adjustments to the numerator and denominator have been reflected in the calculation of these ratios. 
 
Potential problem loans include 
loans on nonaccrual status or past due as di
sclosed in Table 22. 
In addition, for the 
commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by 

management as potential problem loans. Refer to Note 4 ﬁLoans and ACLﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial 

Statementsﬂ herein for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans. 
 TDRs generally occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is ex
pected to experience, financial 
difficulties in the near-term. 
As a result, BB&T will work with the bor
rower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of 
recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concession
ary modification that would not ot
herwise be considered may be 
granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. Refer 
to Note 1 ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Policiesﬂ in the 
ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ for additional policy information regarding TDRs. 
 BB&T™s performing TDRs, excluding govern
ment guaranteed GNMA mortgage loans, 
totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 
2014, a reduction of $655 million compared to the prior year. This decline includes the sale of $540 million of performing 
residential mortgage TDRs durin
g the third quarter of 2014.

   Payments and payoffs represent cash receive
d from borrowers in connection with sc
heduled principal payments, prepayments 
and payoffs of amounts outstanding. Transfers to nonperforming TDRs represent loans that no longer meet the requirements 
necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status and as a 
result are subsequently classified as a nonperforming TDR. 
 
TDRs may be removed due to the passage of time if they: (1) di
d not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (2) have 
performed in accordance with the modified 
terms (generally a minimum of six months
), (3) were reported as a TDR over a 
year end reporting period, and (4) reflected an
 interest rate on the modified loan that was no less than a market rate at the d
ate of modification. These loans were previously
 considered TDRs as a result of structur
al concessions such as extended interest-
only terms or an amortization period
 that did not otherwise conform 
to normal underwr
iting guidelines.  
In addition, certain loans may be removed from classification 
as a TDR as a result of a subsequent non-concessionary re-
modification. Non-concessionary re-modifications represent TDRs that did not contain concessionary terms at the date of a 
subsequent renewal/modification and there was a reasonable exp
ectation that the borrower would continue to comply with 
the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the re-modification. A re-modification may be considered for such a re-
classification if the loan has not had a forgiveness of principal or interest and the modified terms qualify as more than minor
 such that the re-modified loan is considered a new loan. Altern
atively, such loans may be cons
idered for reclassification in 
years subsequent to the date of the re-modification based on 
the passage of time as described in the preceding paragraph. 
 In connection with consumer loan TDRs, a 
NPL will be returned to accruing status when current as to principal and interest 
and upon a sustained historical repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months). The following table provides 

further details regarding the payment status of TDRs:

 The ACL, which totaled $1.5 billion and $1
.8 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013
, respectively, consists of the ALLL, 
which is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the RUFC, which is included in other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ALLL amounted to 1.23% of loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2014, 

compared to 1.49% at December 
31, 2013. The declin
e in the ALLL reflects continued im
provement in cred
it quality in most 
loan portfolios. The ratio
 of the ALLL to NPLs held for investment was 
2.39x at December 31, 2014
 compared to 1.85x at 
December 31, 2013. 

 Net charge-offs totaled $538 million for 2014, compared to $792
 million in 2013. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average 
loans and leases were 0.46% for 2014, co
mpared to 0.69% in 2013. Net charge-offs declined in most loan portfolios, 
including decreases in the commercial and industrial and direct
 retail lending portfolios of 55.7%% and 63.6%, respectively. 
CRE Œ construction and development had net recoveries of $8 million for the year.

 Funding Activities  
 Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and inve
sting activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, 
and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities 
also provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other 
secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through 

the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sour
ces. Funding activities are monitored and governed through 
BB&T™s overall asset/liability management process, which is fu
rther discussed in the ﬁMarket Risk Managementﬂ section in 
ﬁManagement™s Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operationsﬂ herein. The following section 
provides a brief description of the various sources of funds. 
     
64 
 Deposits  
 Deposits are attracted principally from clients within BB&T™s br
anch network through the offering of a broad selection of 
deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking 
accounts, savings accounts, money market 
deposit accounts, CDs and IRAs. Deposit acco
unt terms vary with respect to the 
minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid 
on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) the interest rates offered by competitors, (ii) the anticipated amount an
d timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alte
rnative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economi
c conditions and interest rates. Deposits ar
e attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. Deposit
s are regarded as an important part of the overall client 
relationship and provide opportunities to cross-sell other BB&T 
services. 

 Total deposits were $129.0 billion at December 31, 2014, an
 increase of $1.6 billion compared to year-end 2013. 
Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $38.8 billion at Decembe
r 31, 2014, an increase of $3
.8 billion from December 31, 
2013. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was broad based in nature, with increases in deposits from personal, 

business and public funds clients. During 2014, interest checking increased $1.4 billion and money market and savings 
increased $2.0 billion, while time deposits and IRAs decreased $5.7 billion.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2014, total 
deposits averaged $129.1 billion, an incr
ease of $522 million 
compared to 2013. 
The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.26% for 2014, compared to 0.32% for 2013. 
 The following table presents the composition of 
average deposits for the last five quarters:

   Average deposits for the fourth quarter of
 2014 were $130.3 billion, a decrease of 
$293 million or 0.9% annualized compared 
to the third quarter. The change in average deposits reflects impr
oved mix, with noninterest-bear
ing deposits up $1.0 billion, 
or 10.7% annualized, while interest-bearing balances were 
down $1.3 billion, or 5.7% annualized. Noninterest-bearing 
deposits represented 30.0% of total average deposits for the fo
urth quarter of 2014, compared 
to 29.2% for the prior quarter 
and 28.1% for the fourth quarter of 2013.   
 The growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits during the quarter includes an increase in average commercial accounts 
totaling $678 million and an increase in av
erage public funds accounts totaling $325 million. The decline in interest-bearing 
accounts was driven by a $3.3 billion dec
line in time deposits and IRAs, partially o
ffset by a $1.2 billio
n increase in money 
market and savings and a $720 million increase in interest checking.  

 
The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 
0.25% for the fourth quarter of 2014, a d
ecrease of one basis po
int compared to the 
third quarter.

   Short-term Borrowings  
 BB&T also uses various types of short-term borrowings to m
eet funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for 
funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and 
other balance sheet management purposes. Short-term borrowings were 1.8% of total funding on average in 2014 as 
compared to 2.5% in 2013. See Note 8 ﬁS
hort-Term Borrowingsﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ herein 

for further disclosure. The types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal 
funds purchased, securities sold under 
repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper and short-term bank notes. 
Short-term borrowings at the end of 2014 were $3.7 billion, a 
decrease of $421 million, or 
10.2%, compared to year-end 
2013. Average short-term borrowings totaled $3.4 billion durin
g 2014 compared to $4.5 billion last year, a decrease of 
23.3%. The decrease in the average balance of short-term borr
owings during 2014 primarily reflects an increase in deposits 
and long-term debt as funding sources.  
 The following table summarizes 
certain information for the past three years 
with respect to short-term borrowings:

Long-term Debt  
 
Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital. During 2014, long-term debt represented 12.0% 
of average total funding compar
ed to 10.6% during 20
13. At December 31, 2014, long-ter
m debt totaled $2
3.3 billion, an 
increase of $1.8 billion compared to year-e
nd 2013. The increase in long-term debt reflects the issuance of $2.6 billion of 
BB&T Corporation senior notes, $2.0 billion of Branch Bank se
nior notes and $850 million of Branch Bank subordinated 
notes, partially offset by the early extinguishment of $1.1 
billion of FHLB debt and other payments and maturities. The 
average cost of long-term debt was 2.36% in 2014, compared to 3.03% in 2013. See Note 10 ﬁLong-Term Debtﬂ in the 
ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Stat
ementsﬂ herein for further disclosure. 
 
Exclusive of hedge basis adjustments, FHLB advances represented 28.5% of total outstanding long-term debt at 

December 31, 2014, compared to
 38.5% at December 31, 2013. 
FHLB advances are long-term 
funding sources that provide 
flexibility to structure the debt in a manner that aids in the management of interest rate risk and liquidity.

  Shareholders™ Equity  
 Shareholders™ equity totaled $24.4 billion at
 December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.6
 billion, or 7.1%, from year-end 2013. 
Book value per common share at Decem
ber 31, 2014 was $30.16, compared
 to $28.52 at D
ecember 31, 2013. 
 
Shareholders™ equity increased due to net income in exces
s of dividends declared of $1.4 billion and $313 million of 
issuances of shares and other transactio
ns in connection with equity-based compensation plans, the 401(k) plan and the 
dividend reinvestment plan. The net loss in AOCI increased $158 million, primarily due to a $323 million after-tax pension 

impact, partially offset by a $194 million after-tax net 
increase in the value of the AFS securities portfolio.  
 
Tangible book value per common share at December 31, 2014 wa
s $19.93 compared to $18.08 at December 31, 2013. As of 
December 31, 2014, measures of 
tangible capital were not required by the regu
lators and, therefore,
 were considered non-
GAAP measures. Refer to the section titled ﬁCapitalﬂ herein
 for a discussion of how BB&T calculates and uses these 
measures in the evaluation of the Company. 
 Risk Management 
  BB&T has a strong and consistent risk culture, based on established risk values, which promotes predictable and consistent 
performance within an enviro
nment of open communication an
d effective challenge. The strong culture influences all 
associates in the organization daily and 
helps them evaluate whether risks are 
acceptable or unacceptable while making 
decisions that balance quality, profitability and growth ap
propriately. BB&T™s effective risk management framework 
establishes an environment which enables it to achieve superior
 performance relative to peers,
 ensures that BB&T is viewed 
among the safest of banks and assures the operational freedom to act on opportunities. 
 BB&T ensures that there is an appropriate re
turn for the amount of risk taken, and that the expected return is in line with its
 strategic objectives and business plan. Risk-taking activities ar
e evaluated and prioritized to
 identify those that present 
attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving asset value.
 BB&T only undertakes risks that are understood and can be 
managed effectively. By managing risk we
ll, BB&T ensures sufficient capital is available to maintain and grow core business 
operations in a safe and sound manner.   
 Regardless of financial gain or loss to the Company, associates are held accountable if they do not follow the established risk
 management policies and procedures.  Compensation decisions take
 into account an associate™s adherence to, and successful 
implementation of, BB&T™s risk values.   The compensation stru
cture supports the Company™s core values and sound risk 

management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 
 BB&T™s risk culture encourages transparency and open dialogue between all levels in the performance of organizational 

functions, such as the development, marketing and implementation of a product or service.   
 BB&T has established a risk management framework based on a ﬁthree lines of defenseﬂ model: 

  First Line of Defense:
  Risk management begins with the business units and corporate support groups, the point at 

which risk is originated and where risks must be managed.
  Business unit managers in the first line identify, assess, 
control and report their group™s risk profile compared to its approved risk limits.  
  Second Line of Defense:
  The RMO provides independent oversight and guidance of risk-taking across the 
enterprise. The RMO aggregates, inte
grates, and correlates risk informa
tion into a holistic picture of the 
corporation™s risk profile and concentrations. The RMO 
establishes policies and limits
 and reports sources and 
amounts of risk to Executive Management and the Board of Directors. 

  Third Line of Defense:
  Audit Services (BB&T™s internal audit functio
n) evaluates the design and effectiveness of 
the risk management framework and its results. Results are reported to Executive Management and the Board of 

Directors according to 
Audit Services Policy.

              Chief Risk Officer 
   The CRO leads the RMO, which designs, organizes and manages BB&T™s risk management framework. The RMO is 
responsible for ensuring effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, reporting and consistency. The 
CRO has direct access to the Board of Directors and Executiv
e Management. The CRO is responsible for identifying and 
communicating in a timely manner to the CEO and the Board of 
Directors meaningful risks an
d significant instances when 
the RMO™s assessment of risk differs from that of a business un
it, significant instances when a business unit is not adhering 
to the risk governance framework, and BB&T™s risk profile in rela
tion to its risk appetite on at least a quarterly basis. In th
e event that the CRO and CEO™s assessment of risk management 
were to differ or if the CEO did not adhere to the risk 
management framework, the CRO would have the responsib
ility to report such matters to the Board of Directors. 
 
The Executive Management-led enterprise 
risk committees provide oversight of the first and second lines of defense and 
communicate risk appetite and values to the RMO. The CRO and 
the enterprise risk committees approve policies, set risk 
limits and tolerances and monitor results.  

 The RMC, CRMC, ORMC, CROC and the MRLCC are the enterprise
 risk committees and provide oversight of the risks as 
described in the common risk language. Executive Management members participate in all five committees.  
 The risk management framework is composed of specialized risk functions focused on specific types of risk. The MRLCC, 
CRMC, CROC and ORMC provide oversight of market, liquidity, capital, credit, compliance, and operational risk while 

RMC provides a fully integrated view of all material risks acro
ss the company. The RMC provid
es oversight of all risks and 
its purpose is to review BB&T™s aggregate risk exposure, evaluate
 risk appetite, and evaluate risks not reviewed by other risk 
committees.   The RMC is responsible for taking a broad view of risk, incorp
orating information from all risk functions. This combination 
of broad and specific focus provides the most effective framework for the management of risk. The RMC is chaired by the 
CRO and its membership includes all members of Executive Management, the General Auditor (ex officio) and senior 
leaders from Financial Management, the RMO and other areas. 

 The principal types of inherent risk include compliance, credit, liquidity, market, operational, reputation and strategic risks
.  Compliance risk  
 
Compliance risk is the risk to 
current or anticipated earnings or capital arisin
g from violations of laws, rules or regulations
, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policie
s and procedures or ethical st
andards. This risk exposes 
BB&T to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can result in 

diminished reputation, reduced 
franchise or enterprise value, limited busine
ss opportunities and lessened expansion potential. 
 Credit risk  
 Credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising fro
m the default, inability or unwillingness of a
 borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any 
financial obligation with BB&T or otherwise perform as agreed. 
Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on th
e performance of a borrower, ob
ligor, or counterparty. Credit 
risk arises when BB&T funds ar
e extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual 
agreements, whether on or off balance sheet. Credit risk also o
ccurs when the credit quality of 
an issuer whose securities or 
other instruments the bank holds deteriorates. 
     
68 
 BB&T has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:  
  limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;  
  establishing a process for credit approval accountability;  
  careful initial underwriting and anal
ysis of borrower, tr
ansaction, market and collateral risks;  
  ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;  
  continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and  
  periodically reevaluating the bank™s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions 
change.  The following discussion presents the principal types of lending conducted by BB&T and describes the underwriting 
procedures and overall risk management of BB&T™s lending function. 
 Underwriting Approach  

 The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk, 
therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to BB&T™s lon
g-term financial success. BB&T™s underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable co
mbinations of specific risk-
mitigating features that ensure credit relationships conform to BB&T™s risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the 

most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:  
  Cash flow and debt service coverage
Šcash flow adequacy is a necessary 
condition of creditwor
thiness, meaning 
that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower™s cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary 

repayment sources. 
  Secondary sources of repayment
Šalternative repayment funds are a significant 
risk-mitigating factor as long as they 
are liquid, can be easily accessed and 
provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source. 
  Value of any underlying collateral
Šloans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis of 
the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most 
important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not 
justify loans that cannot be serviced 
by the borrower™s normal cash flows. 
  Overall creditworthiness of the customer, taking into account the customer™s relationships, both past and current, 
with BB&T and other lenders
ŠBB&T™s success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships 
with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background. 
  Level of equity invested in the transaction
Šin general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of 
their own funds prior to any loan advances. 
 
Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio  
 
The commercial loan and leas
e portfolio represents the la
rgest category of th
e Company™s total loan portfolio. BB&T™s 
commercial lending program is generally targeted to serve sma
ll-to-middle market businesses wi
th sales of $250 million or 
less. In addition, BB&T™s Corporate Banking Group provides le
nding solutions to large corporate clients. Traditionally, 
lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been among BB&T™s strongest market segments. 

 
Commercial and small business loans are primarily originated
 through BB&T™s Community Bank. In accordance with the 
Company™s lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates BB&T™s underwriting 

approach, procedures and evaluations described above. Commercia
l loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to 
market indices, such as the prime rate or LIBOR. Commercial 
loans are individually monitored and reviewed for any possible 
deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan
. Approximately 89% of BB&T™s commercial loans are secured by 
real estate, business equipment, invent
ories and other types of collateral. 
     
69 
 Direct Retail Loan Portfolio  
 The direct retail loan portfolio primarily consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through BB&T™s branch network. 

Various types of secured and unsecured loans 
are marketed to qualifying existing clie
nts and to other cred
itworthy candidates 
in BB&T™s market area. The vast majority of direct retail loans 
are secured by first or second 
liens on residential real estate
 and include both closed-end home equity loans and revolving home 
equity lines of credit. Direct retail loans are subject to the
 same rigorous lending policies and procedures as described 
above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note 
amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the Company™s risk philosophy. 

 
As a result of new qualified mortgage regulations, during Janua
ry 2014, approximately $8.3 billion of closed-end, first and 
second lien position residential mortgage loans were transferred from Community Banking to Residential Mortgage Banking 

based on a change in how these loans are managed. 
 Sales Finance Loan Portfolio  

 The sales finance category primarily include
s secured indirect installment loans to 
consumers for the purchase of new and 
used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Such loans 
are originated through approved
 franchised and independent 
dealers throughout the BB&T market area.
 These loans are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually 
significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Sa
les finance loans are subject to the same rigorous lending polic
ies and procedures as described above for commercial loans and are underwritten with note amounts an
d credit limits that ensure 
consistency with the Company™s risk philosophy. In add
ition to its normal underwriting due diligence, BB&T uses 
application systems and ﬁscoring systemsﬂ to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its sales finance portfolio. Also 
included in the sales finance category are commercial lines, se
rviced by the Dealer Finance 
Department, to finance dealer 
wholesale inventory (ﬁFloor Plan Linesﬂ) 
for resale to consumers. Floor Plan Li
nes are underwritten by commercial loan 
officers in compliance with the same rigorous lending policies de
scribed above for commercial loans. In addition, Floor Plan 
Lines are subject to intensive monitoring and oversight to ensure quality and to mitigate risk, including from fraud. 

 Revolving Credit Loan Portfolio  
 
The revolving credit portfolio consists of
 the outstanding balances on credit car
ds and BB&T™s checking account overdraft 
protection product, Constant Credit. BB&T markets credit cards to its existing banking client base and does not solicit 

cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and 
actively managed. 
 
Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio  
 Branch Bank offers various types of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or 

refinancing residential properties. BB&T primarily originat
es conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and 
construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied proper
ties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in 
accordance with the underwriting 
standards set forth by FNMA 
and FHLMC. They are genera
lly collateralized by one-to-
four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-coll
ateral value ratios of 80% or le
ss at origination, and are made
 to borrowers in good credit standing. 

 
Risks associated with the mortgage lending function include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a 
substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market, and an effective MSR hedging process. 
Borrower risk is lessened through rigorous underwriting proce
dures and mortgage insurance. The right to service the loans 
and receive servicing income is generally
 retained when conforming loans are sold
. Management believes that the retention 
of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management™s strategy to establish profitable 

long-term customer relationships and offer high quality client se
rvice. BB&T also purchases residential mortgage loans from 
correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the same underwriting and risk-
management criteria as loans originated internally. 
 Other Lending Subsidiaries Portfolio  
 
BB&T™s other lending subsidiaries portfolio consists of loans originated through six LOBs that provide specialty finance 
alternatives to consumers and businesses 
including: dealer-based financing of equipment for small businesses and consumers, 
commercial equipment leasing and finance, insurance premium 
finance, indirect nonprime automobile finance, and full-
service commercial mortgage banking. BB&
T offers these services to bank clients 
as well as nonbank clients within and 
outside BB&T™s primary geographic market area. 
     
70 
 BB&T™s other lending subsidiaries adhere to the same overall underwriting approach as the commercial and consumer 
lending portfolio and also utilize automated credit scoring to a
ssist with underwriting credit ri
sk. The majority of these loan
s are relatively homogenous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. The 
majority of the loans are secured by r
eal estate, automobiles, equipment or une
arned insurance premiums. As of December 
31, 2014, included in the other lending subsidiaries portfolio are loans to nonprime borrowers of approximately $3.1 billion, 

or 2.5% of the total BB&T loan and lease portfolio. 

 Acquired from FDIC 
 
BB&T™s loan portfolio includes $1.2 billion of loans acquired 
from the FDIC. This balance includes $654 million of loans 
that are covered by loss sharing agreemen
ts and $561 million of loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. 
Refer to Note 4 ﬁLoans and ACLﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolid
ated Financial Statementsﬂ and 
to ﬁAcquired from FDIC and 
FDIC Loss Share Receivable/Payableﬂ
 section of ﬁManagement™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operationsﬂ in this report for additional 
disclosures related to loans acquired from the FDIC.  
 Liquidity risk  
 Liquidity risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or
 capital that BB&T will be unable to meet its obligations as th
ey come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain ad
equate funding (funding liquidity risk) or that it cannot easi
ly unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowe
ring market prices because of inadequate market depth or 
market disruptions (market liquidity risk). 
 Market risk  
 Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or
 capital arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, 
securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results
 from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among 
financial market rates or prices, including interest rates, fore
ign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices or other 
relevant rates or prices.  
 
Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing 
of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); 
from changing rate relationships among different yield curves
 affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate 
relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve 
risk); and from interest-related options embedded in bank 
products (options risk). 

 
For additional information concerning BB&T™s management of 
market risk, see the ﬁMarket Risk Managementﬂ section of 
ﬁManagement™s Discussion and Anal
ysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsﬂ herein. 
 
Operational risk  
 
Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings 
or capital arising from inadequa
te or failed internal processes
, people and systems or from external events. This definition includ
es legal risk, which is the risk
 of loss arising from defecti
ve transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failu
re to adequately protect
 company-owned assets. 
 
Cybersecurity 
 In recent years, cybers
ecurity has gained prominence within the financial services industry due to increases in the quantity 
and sophistication of cyber attacks, which include significant 
distributed denial-of-service attacks, malicious code and viruse
s and attempts to breach the secur
ity of systems, which, in certa
in instances, have resulted in
 unauthorized access to customer 
account data.  
 BB&T has a number of complex information systems used for a variety of functions by customers, employees and vendors.  
In addition, third parties with which BB&T does business or th
at facilitate business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, 
clearing houses, central depositories and financial intermediari
es) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to BB&T, 
including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber 

attacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to BB&T. 
      
71 
 As a FHC, BB&T must adhere to the security requirements an
d expectations of the applicab
le regulatory agencies, which 
include requirements related to data privacy, systems ava
ilability and business continuity planning, among others. The 
regulatory agencies have established guidelines for the responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management, 
which include establishing policy, appointing and training pers
onnel, implementing review and testing functions and ensuring 
an appropriate frequency of updates.  

 
The primary responsibility for cybersecurity at BB&T lies with
 the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which has 
delegated the day-to-day operations to management via the RMC, ORMC and EITSC.  The EITSC serves as the primary 

team responsible for monitoring and reporting on cybersecurity
 risks. The EITSC, which is led by the Chief Information 
Officer, reports to the RMC and ORMC once a month and also provides a quarterly Cyber Security Update to the Board of 
Directors. Annually, the EITS
C provides a formal IT risk assessment and 
Information Security reports to the Risk 
Committee. 

 As a complement to the overall cybersecurity infrastructure,
 BB&T utilizes a number of internal training methods, both 
formally through mandatory courses and informally through wr
itten communications and other updates. Internal policies and 
procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting 
of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. BB&T 
also uses third party services as part of its cybersecurity fra
mework, and any such third parties are required to comply with 
BB&T™s policies regarding information security and confiden
tiality. BB&T also uses third party groups to assess and 
supplement the Company™
s cybersecurity needs. 
 
These cyber attacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption to BB&T™s operations or harm to its customers and 
have not had a material adverse effect on BB&T™s results 
of operations; however, there 
can be no assurance that a 
sophisticated cyber attack can
 be detected or thwarted. 
 
Reputation risk  
 Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings
, capital, enterprise value, the 
BB&T brand, and public confidenc
e arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding BB&T™s business practices, products, 

services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by BB&T, 
its representatives, or its partners. A negative reputation may
 impair BB&T™s relationship with clients, associates, communities 
or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises 
when other risks are not managed properly. 

 Strategic risk  
 Strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings,
 capital, enterprise value and th
e achievement of BB&T™s vision, 
mission, purpose and business objectives consistent with its valu
es that arises from BB&T™s business strategy or potentially 
adverse business decisions, improper or ineffective implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to 

changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Strategic risk is a function of BB&T™s strategic goals, business 
strategies, resources and quality of implementation. The responsibility for managing this risk rests with the Board of 
Directors, Executive Management 
and the Senior Leadership Team. 
 Market Risk Management 
 The effective management of market risk is essential to 
achieving BB&T™s strategic financial objectives. As a financial 
institution, BB&T™s most significant market risk exposure is intere
st rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also
 includes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk
 in BB&T™s LOBs. The primary objectives of market risk 
management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in
 market risk factors may have on net interest income, net 
income and capital and to offset the risk 
of price changes for certain assets recorded
 at fair value. At BB&T, market risk 
management also includes the 
enterprise-wide IPV function. 
 Interest Rate Market Risk (Other than Trading) 
 
BB&T actively manages market risk associated with asset and liab
ility portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset
 and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity 
mixes of assets and liabilities. The goal of these activities is 
the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportu
nities in BB&T™s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will 
produce reasonably consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates. These portfolios are analyzed for 
proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes 
under various interest rate scenarios. 
     
72 
 The asset/liability management process is designed to achieve re
latively stable NIM and assure liquidity by coordinating the 
volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning asse
ts, deposits and borrowed funds. Among other things, this 
process gives consideration to prepayment trends related to s
ecurities, loans and leases and ce
rtain deposits that have no 
stated maturity. Prepayment assumptions are developed using a combination of market data and internal historical 
prepayment experience for residential mortgage-related loans an
d securities, and internal historical prepayment experience 
for client deposits with no stated maturity and loans that ar
e not residential mortgage related. These assumptions are subject 
to monthly back-testing, and are adjusted as deemed necessary to
 reflect changes in interest rates relative to the reference ra
te of the underlying assets or liabilities. On a monthly basis, BB&T evaluates the accuracy of its Simulation model, which 
includes an evaluation of its prepayment assumptions, to ensure that all significant assumptions inherent in the model 

appropriately reflect changes in the interest
 rate environment and related trends in prepayment activity. It is the responsibil
ity of the MRLCC to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing 

liabilities, as well as to ensure an adequate level of liquidity
 and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals
. The MRLCC also sets policy guidelines and establishes long-term st
rategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and 
liquidity. The MRLCC meets regularly to re
view BB&T™s interest rate risk and liqui
dity positions in relation to present and 
prospective market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to 
ensure that the potential impacts on earning
s and liquidity as a result of fluctuations
 in interest rates are within acceptable
 tolerance guidelines. 
 BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk re
lated to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage 
banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. BB&
T also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf 
of its clients. As of December 31, 2014, BB&T had derivative financial instruments outsta
nding with notional amounts 
totaling $72.3 billion, with a net fair value of a gain of $109 
million. See Note 19 ﬁDerivative Financial Instrumentsﬂ in the 
ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ herein for additional disclosures. 

 The majority of BB&T™s assets and liabilities are monetary in natu
re and, therefore, differ grea
tly from most commercial and 
industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Fluctuations in interest rates and actio
ns of the FRB to regulate the availability and cost of credit have
 a greater effect on a financial institution™s profitability tha
n do 
the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the 
MRLCC, management believes that BB&T is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates 

and inflationary trends. 
 Management uses the Simulation to measure the sensitivity of proj
ected earnings to changes in interest rates. The Simulation 
projects net interest income and interest rate risk for a rollin
g two-year period of time. The Simulation takes into account th
e current contractual agreements that BB&T has made with its customers on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and 

commitments to enter into those transactions. Furthermore, 
the Simulation considers the im
pact of expected customer 
behavior. Management monitors BB&T™s interest sensitivity by means of a model that incorporates the current volumes, 

average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and paym
ents of asset and liability portfolios, together with multiple 
scenarios that include projected prepayments, repricing opportu
nities and anticipated volume growth. Using this information, 
the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio balances 
under multiple interest rate s
cenarios. This level of detail 
is needed to simulate the effect that change
s in interest rates and portfolio balances 
may have on the earnings of BB&T. This 
method is subject to the accuracy of the as
sumptions that underlie the process, but
 management believes that it provides a 
better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses such as static or dynamic g
ap. 
In addition to the Simulation, BB&T uses EVE analysis to focu
s on projected changes in capital given potential changes in 
interest rates. This measure also allows BB&T to analyze intere
st rate risk that falls outside the analysis window contained in
 the Simulation. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of th
e portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments. 
The difference in the present value of asse
ts minus the present value of liabilities is 
defined as the economic value of equity
.  The asset/liability management process requires a number of
 key assumptions. Management determines the most likely 
outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors, including published economic projections and data, 

the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies, as well as
 any enacted or prospective regu
latory changes. BB&T™s current 
and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volume
s and projected growth, accessibility of funds for short-term 
needs and capital maintenance are also cons
idered. This data is combined with various interest rate scenarios to provide 
management with the information necessary to analyze i
nterest sensitivity and to aid in
 the development of strategies to reach 
performance goals.

 The following table shows the effect that 
the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as 
projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change 
in interest rates as described below. Key assumptions in the 
preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mo
rtgage-related and other assets, cash flows and maturities of 
derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, de
posit sensitivity, customer preferences and capital plans. The 
resulting change in net interest income reflects the level of 
interest rate sensitivity that income has in relation to the 
investment, loan and deposit portfolios.

       The MRLCC has established parameters related to interest sensitivity that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net 
interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In 
the event the results of the Simulation model fall outside the 
established parameters, management will make recommendations to the MRLCC on the most appropriate response given the 
current economic for
ecast. The following parameters and interest rate sc
enarios are considered BB&T™s primary measures of 
interest rate risk: 

  Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 2% for the next 12 months assuming a linear change in interest 
rates totaling 100 basis points over four months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining eight 
month period.  

  Maximum negative impact on net interest income of 4% for the next 12 months assuming a linear change of 200 

basis points over eight months followed by a flat interest rate scenario for the remaining four month period.  
 If a rate change of 200 basis points cannot be modeled due to a low level of rates, a proportional limit applies. Management 
currently only models a negative 25 basis point decline because la
rger declines would have resulted in a Federal funds rate of 
less than zero. In a situation such as this, the maximum negative impact on net interest income is adjusted on a proportional 
basis. Regardless of the proportional limit, the negative risk expo
sure limit will be the greater of 1% or the proportional lim
it. 
 
Management has also established a maximum negative impact on net interest income of 4% for an immediate 100 basis 
points change in rates and 8% for an immediate 200 basis points change in rates. These ﬁinterest rate shockﬂ limits are 

designed to create an outer band of
 acceptable risk based upon a significa
nt and immediate change in rates. 
 
Management must also consider how the balance sheet and interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in 

balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been 
very strong during the current 
economic cycle. Much of this 
liquidity increase has been due to a significant increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Consistent with the industry,
 Branch Bank has seen a significant increase
 in this funding source. The behavior 
of these deposits is one of the most 
important assumptions used in determining the interest rate ri
sk position of BB&T. A loss of these deposits in the future 
would reduce the asset sensitivity of BB&T™s balance sheet as the 
Company increases interest-bearing funds to offset the loss 
of this advantageous funding source. 
 Beta represents the correlation 
between overall market interest rates and the ra
tes paid by BB&T on interest-bearing deposits. 
BB&T applies an average beta of approximately 80% to its manage
d rate deposits for determining its interest rate sensitivity. 
Managed rate deposits are high beta, premium money market and interest checking accounts, which attract significant client 

funds when needed to support balance sheet growth. BB&T regularly conducts sensitivity on other key variables to determine 
the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position. This allows BB&T to evaluate the likely impact on its balance 

sheet management strategies due to a more extr
eme variation in a key assumption than expected. 
 
The following table shows the effect that 
the loss of demand deposits and an associ
ated increase in managed rate deposits 
would have on BB&T™s interest-rate sensitivity position. For purp
oses of this analysis, BB&T modeled the incremental beta 
for the replacement of the lost demand deposits at 100%.

The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical 
percentage change in net interest income at December 31, 
2014 as presented in the preceding table. 
 If rates increased 200 basis points, BB&T could absorb the loss 
of $7.5 billion, or 19.2%, of noninterest bearing demand 
deposits and replace them with managed rate deposits with a beta
 of 100% before becoming neutra
l to interest rate changes.  
 
The following table shows the effect that 
the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE. Key assumptions in the 
preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mo
rtgage-related and other assets, cash flows and maturities of 
derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing an
d deposit sensitivity. During the third quarter of 2014, BB&T 
implemented assumption changes that impacted the reported 
EVE sensitivity. The primary change was a reduction to the 
assumed duration of indeterminate deposits, which resulted in an increase in reported liability sensitivity in EVE rate shocks.
 The estimated impact on the ﬁHypothetical Percentage Change 
in EVEﬂ was approximately 375 basis points in the ﬁup 200 
basis pointsﬂ scenario.

     Market Risk from Trading Activities 
 
BB&T also manages market risk from trading activities which consists of acting as a financial intermediary to provide its 

customers access to derivatives, foreign exch
ange and securities markets. Trading mark
et risk is managed through the use of 
statistical and non-statistical risk measures and limits. BB&T 
utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate 
risks across its covered trading LOBs. This methodology uses two years of historical data to estimate economic outcomes for 

a one-day time horizon at a 99% confidence level. The aver
age 99% one-day VaR and the maximum daily VaR for the years 
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were each less than $1 milli
on. Market risk disclosures un
der Basel II.5 are available in 
the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site on www.bbt.com. 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of 
borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments
. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cas
h equivalents and AFS securities, many other 
factors affect the ability to
 meet liquidity needs, in
cluding access to a variety of
 funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national m
oney markets, growing core deposits, the repayment of loans 
and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 
     
75 
 BB&T monitors the ability to meet customer demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In 
considering its liquidity position, management evaluates BB&T™s
 funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-
sensitive funding and non-client rate-sensiti
ve funding. In addition, management also evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive 
funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash 

outflows for Branch Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand 
and highly liquid unpledged securities. The Company has established a policy that the liquid asset buffer would be a 

minimum of 5% of total assets, but intends to maintain the ratio
 well in excess of this level. As of December 31, 2014 and 
December 31, 2013, BB&T™s liquid asset buffer was 13
.6% and 14.6%, respectively, of total assets. 
 
During 2013, the FDIC, FRB and OCC released a joint statem
ent providing a NPR concerning the U.S. implementation of 
the Basel III LCR rule. This rule became final on September 3, 2014. Unde
r the final rule, BB&T will be considered a 
ﬁmodified LCRﬂ holding company. BB&T would be subject to fu
ll LCR requirements if its operations were to fall under the 
ﬁinternationally activeﬂ rules, which would generally be tri
ggered if BB&T™s asse
ts were to increase above $250 billion. 
BB&T implemented balance sheet changes to support its compliance with the rule and to optimize its balance sheet based on 

the final rule. These actions included chan
ging the mix of the investment portfolio to include more GNMA and U.S. Treasury 
securities, which qualify as Level 1 under the rule, and changing
 its deposit mix to increase retail and commercial deposits. 
Based on management™s interpretation of the final rule 
that will be effective Janu
ary 1, 2016, BB&T™s LCR was 
approximately 130% at December 31, 2
014, compared to the regulatory minimum of 90%, which puts BB&T in full 
compliance with the rule. The regulatory minimum will increase to
 100% on January 1, 2017. The final rule requires each 
financial institution to have a method for determining ﬁoperational depositsﬂ as defined by the rule. The number above 

includes an estimate of operational deposits; however, BB&T 
continues to evaluate its method to identify and measure 
operational deposits. 

 
Parent Company 
 
The purpose of the Parent Company is to
 serve as the primary capital financing ve
hicle for the operating subsidiaries. The 
assets of the Parent Company primarily consist of cash on de
posit with Branch Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, 
advances to subsidiaries, accounts receivabl
e from subsidiaries, and other miscellane
ous assets. The principal obligations of 
the Parent Company are principal and interest payments on 
long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent 
Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, 
repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from 
the issuance of equity and l
ong-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are for investments in 
subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common 
stock and interest and principal payments due on long-term debt. 
 
The primary source of funds 
used for Parent Company cash requirements wa
s dividends received from subsidiaries, which 
totaled $1.7 billion during 2014. In addition, the Parent Compan
y issued $2.6 billion of senior notes and repaid $1.5 billion o
f maturing long-term debt. Funds raised through master note 
agreements with commercial clients are placed in a note 
receivable at Branch Bank primarily for its use in meeting shor
t-term funding needs and, to 
a lesser extent, to support the 
short-term temporary cash need
s of the Parent Company. At 
December 31, 2013, master note balances totaled $24 million. 
 
Liquidity at the Parent Company is more susceptible to ma
rket disruptions. BB&T prudently manages cash levels at the 
Parent Company to cover a minimum of on
e year of projected contractual cash ou
tflows which includes unfunded external 
commitments, debt service, preferred dividends and scheduled 
debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash infusions. 
Generally, BB&T maintains a significant buffer above the projected
 one year of contractual cash 
outflows. In determining the 
buffer, BB&T considers cash requirements for common and preferre
d dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, being a 
source of strength to its banking subsidiaries and being able 
to withstand sustained market di
sruptions that could limit access
 to the capital markets. As of December 31
, 2014 and December 31, 2
013, the Parent Company had 31 months and 27 months, 
respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected contractual cash outflows as described above. 

     
76 
 Branch Bank 
 BB&T carefully manages liquidity risk at 
Branch Bank. Branch Bank™s primary so
urce of funding is customer deposits. 
Continued access to customer deposits is highly dependent on the confidence the public has in the stability of the bank and its
 ability to return funds to the client when requested. BB&T mainta
ins a strong focus on its reputation in the market to ensure 
continued access to client deposits. BB&T integrates its risk ap
petite into its overall risk management framework to ensure 
the bank does not exceed its risk tolerance through its lending and other risk taking functions and thus risk becoming 
undercapitalized. BB&T believes that sufficient capital is paramount to maintaining the confidence of its depositors and other 
funds providers. BB&T has extensive capital management proce
sses in place to ensure it ma
intains sufficient capital to absorb losses and maintain a highly capitalized position that will instill confidence in the bank and allow continued access to
 deposits and other funding sources. Branch Bank monitors many liquidity metrics at the bank including funding 

concentrations, diversification, maturity distribution, contin
gent funding needs and ability to meet liquidity requirements 
under times of stress. 

  
Branch Bank has several major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets 
through issuance of senior
 or subordinated bank notes and institutional CDs,
 access to the FHLB system, dealer repurchase 
agreements and repurchase agreements with
 commercial clients, access to the overnig
ht and term Federal funds markets, use 
of a Cayman branch facility, access to reta
il brokered CDs and a borrower in custod
y program with the FRB for the discount 
window. As of December 31, 2014, BB&T ha
s approximately $68.4 billion of secured 
borrowing capacity, which represents 
approximately 686% of one year wholesale funding maturities. 
 The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected
 by the rating agencies™ views of the Parent Company™s and 
Branch Bank™s credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Mana
gement meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to 
discuss current outlooks. The ratings for BB&T and Branch Ba
nk by the major rating agencies are detailed in the table

BB&T and Branch Bank have Contingency Funding Plans designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet 

their ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the ev
ent of a liquidity contraction. These plans are designed to 
examine and quantify the organi
zation™s liquidity under various ﬁstressﬂ scenarios. Additionally, the plans provide a 
framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in
 the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of 
such an event. The plans address authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options and the responsibilities of 

key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. The liquidity options available to management could include seeking 

secured funding, asset sales, and under the most ex
treme scenarios, curtailing new loan originations.  
     
77 
 Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet BB&T™s current requirements and plans for continued 
growth. See Note 5 ﬁPremises and Equipment,ﬂ Note 10 ﬁLong-Term Debtﬂ and Note 15 ﬁCommitments and Contingenciesﬂ 
in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of 

liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.

market area and private equity funds. 
Refer to Note 1 ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Policiesﬂ and to Note 15 
ﬁCommitments and Contingenciesﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ for further discussion of these 

commitments.  In addition, BB&T enters into derivative contracts to manage 
various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument 
that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest ra
te. Derivative contracts are carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the fair value representing the net 
present value of expected future cash receipts or payments ba
sed on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. 
Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating 
payments between counterparties 
and are not a measure of financial risk. Theref
ore, the derivative liabilities recorded on the 
balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 do
 not represent the amounts that may ultima
tely be paid under these contracts. 
Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note 1 ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Policiesﬂ and Note 

19 ﬁDerivative Financial Instrumentsﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ﬂ  
 
In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officer
s and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against 
liabilities arising from litigation. BB&T also issues standard
 representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, 
merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activitie
s and other similar arrangements. Counterparties in many of 
these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to
 BB&T. Although these agreem
ents often do not specify 
limitations, BB&T does not believe that any payments related to
 these guarantees would mate
rially change the financial 
condition or results of 
operations of BB&T.  
     
78 
 BB&T holds public funds in certain states that do not require 
100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. In these 
states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting 
shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that 

state.   As a member of the FHLB, BB&T is required to maintain a mi
nimum investment in capital stock. The board of directors of 
the FHLB can increase the minimum investme
nt requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required 
to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of 

specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to 

increase BB&T™s investment in the FHLB de
pends entirely upon the occu
rrence of a future event, potential future payments 
to the FHLB are not determinable.  

 In the normal course of business, BB&T is also a party to financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to 
mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. Such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain 

contractual agreements, including standby 
letters of credit and financial guarant
ee arrangements. Further discussion of 
BB&T™s commitments is included in Note 15 ﬁCommitments and Contingenciesﬂ and Note 18 ﬁFair Value Disclosuresﬂ in 

the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ﬂ

Related Party Transactions 
 The Company may extend credit to its officer
s and directors in the ordinary course of business. These loans are made under 
substantially the same terms as comparable third-party lending 
arrangements and are in compliance with applicable banking 
regulations. 

 Capital 
 The maintenance of appropriate levels of
 capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. BB&T™s 
principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to pr
ovide adequate capital to suppor
t BB&T™s risk profile consistent
 with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility
 to support future growth an
d client needs, comply with 
relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achiev
e optimal credit ratings for BB&T and its subsidiaries and 
provide a competitive return to shareholders. 
 Management regularly monitors the capital position of BB&T on bo
th a consolidated and bank level basis. In this regard, 
management™s overriding policy is to maintain capital at leve
ls that are in excess of the operating capital guidelines, which 
are above the regulatory ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ levels. Management
 has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum guidelines 
to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated with planned capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by 

the FRB for the annual CCAR. Breaches of stressed minimum guidelines prompt a review of the planned capital actions 
included in BB&T™s capital plan.

s double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a 
percentage of shareholders™ equity). The active management of 
the subsidiaries™ equity capital, as described above, is the 
process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of 

BB&T™s capital position. 
 Management intends to maintain capital at Branch Bank at le
vels that will result in classification as ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ for 
regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is management™s intent to
 maintain Branch Bank™s capital at levels that result in 
regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable
 with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. If 
the 
capital levels of Branch Bank increase abov
e these guidelines, excess capital may be tr
ansferred to the Parent Company in the 
form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations. 
 
While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Company temporarily falling below its operating 
minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is manage
ment™s intent through capital planning to return to these 
targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of 
time. Such temporary decreases 
below the operating minimums 
shown above are not considered an infringement of BB&T™s overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is 

forecast to occur within a reasonable time period. 
 
BB&T regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company™s capital plans
 to the banking regulators. During March 2014, BB&T announced that the FRB did not object to the Company™s 2014 capital 

plan. The 2015 capital plan was submitted during January 2015. Management™s capital deployment plan in order of 

preference is to focus on organic growth, dividend
s, strategic opportunities and share repurchases. 
 
Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier 1 Capital, Tota
l Capital and Tier 1 Common Equity, are calculated based on 
regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.  
 BB&T™s Tier 1 common equity ratio was 
10.6% at December 31, 2014 compared 
to 9.9% at December 31, 2013. The 
increase in regulatory capital was primarily due to strong capital generation during 2014.

 BB&T™s estimated common equity Tier 1 ra
tio under Basel III was approximately 
10.3% at December 31, 2014 based on 
management™s interpretation of the rules adopted by the FRB,
 which became effective on January 1, 2015. The minimum 
required common equity Tier 1 ratio, including the capital c
onservation buffer, will gradually 
increase from 4.5% on January 
1, 2015 to 7.0% on January 1, 2019. See ﬁRegulatory Considerationsﬂ for additional information regarding Basel III.

 Fourth Quarter Results 
 Consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2014 totaling $557 million was up 3.7% 
compared to $537 million earned during the same period in 2013. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the 
fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.76, up 1.3% compared to $0.75 for the same period in 2013. BB&T™s results of operations for 

the fourth quarter of 2014 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.30% and an annualized return on average 
common shareholders™ equity of 10.08%, compared to prior year ratios of 1.30% and 10.85%, respectively. 
 
Total revenues on a FTE basis were $2.4 billion for the fourth qu
arter of 2014, essentially flat compared to the earlier quarte
r as a decrease in taxable-equivalent net interest income of
 $26 million was largely offset by a $19 million increase in 
noninterest income.  

 Net interest margin was 3.36%, down 20 basis points compared 
to the earlier quarter. Average 
earning assets increased $6.5 
billion, or 4.2%, while average interest-bearing liabilities increas
ed $1.2 billion, or 1.1%. The annualized yield on the total
 loan portfolio for the fourth quarter was 
4.29%, a decrease of 34 basis points co
mpared to the earlier quarter, which primarily
 reflects lower yields on new loans and continued runoff of hi
gher yielding loans acquired from the FDIC. The annualized 
FTE yield on the average secur
ities portfolio for the fourth quarter was 2.45%, which was seven basis points lower than the 
earlier period. 

     
82 
 The average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.25
% during the fourth quarter of 
2014, a decline of three basis 
points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The average annualized rate paid on long-term debt was 2.22% during the 
fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 42 
basis points compared to the same quarte
r of the prior year. This decrease was the 
result of lower rates on new issues during the last twelve months and the early extinguishment of higher cost FHLB advances 
in the third quarter of 2014. 
 
The $19 million increase in noninterest income, including secur
ities gains (losses), net, was primarily driven by higher 
insurance and mortgage banking income, which increased $38 million and $28 million, respectively, partially offset by a $51 

million decrease in other income. 

 The provision for credit losses increased $23 million compared to
 the earlier quarter primarily 
due to the reserve release in 
the earlier quarter partially offset by the impact of the fourth 
quarter loan sale. Net charge-off
s for the fourth quarter of 2
014, 
excluding loans acquired from the FDIC and the impact of the loan sale, totaled $106 million, down $35 million compared to 
the earlier quarter. Excluding th
e reserve for unfunded lending commitments an
d the impact of the loan sale, the reserve 
release was $67 million for the fourth qu
arter of 2013 compared to a provision 
of $5 million in the current quarter. 
 
Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 201
4, a decrease of $45 million co
mpared to the earlier quarter.
 This decrease reflects the impact of broad cost control measur
es, including a 1,280 decrease in FTEs, which was partially 
offset by higher loan-related expense due to the $27 million charge related to an ongoing review of mortgage lending 

processes. 

 The provision for income taxes was $236 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $243 million for the earlier 
quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the fourth qu
arter of 2014 of 27.9%, comp
ared to 29.2% for the earlier 
quarter.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The accounting and reporting policies of BB&T are in accordance with 
GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting 
guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The fina
ncial position and results of operations are affected by 
management™s application of accounting polic
ies, including estimates, assumptions 
and judgments made to arrive at the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities a
nd amounts reported for revenues and ex
penses. Different assumptions in the 
application of these policies could result in material changes in
 the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated resul
ts of operations and related disclosures. Understanding BB&T™
s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the 
consolidated financial position and consolidated results of 
operations. Accordingly, BB&T™s significant accounting policies 
and changes in accounting principles and 
effects of new accounting pronouncements
 are discussed in detail in Note 1 
ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Policiesﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ﬂ 
 The following is a summary of BB&T™s critical accounting policies that are high
ly dependent on estimates, assumptions and 
judgments. These critical accountin
g policies are reviewed with th
e Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors on a periodic 
basis. 
 
ACL  
BB&T™s policy is to maintain an ALLL and a RUFC that repres
ent management™s best estimate of probable credit losses 
inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates for 
loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical lo
an and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to 
charge-off experience, current tr
ends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on purchased loans, current 
assessment of problem loans and leases, the 
results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk 
assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of this pro
cess, BB&T develops a series of loss estimate factors, which are
 modeled projections of the frequency, timing and severity of losses. These loss estimate factors are based on historical loss 

experience, economic and political environmental considerations
 and any other data that management believes will provide 
evidence about the expected collectability of outstanding loan and lease amounts. The following table summarizes the loss 
estimate factors used to determine the ALLL. 
     
83 
 Loss Estimate Factor  Description 
 Loss Frequency  Indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan  
Loss Severity  Indicates the amount of estimated loss at the time of default 
 For collectively evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined by multiplying the loan exposure by the loss frequency and loss 

severity factors. For individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower. 

For TDRs, default expectations and estimat
ed slower prepayment speeds that are sp
ecific to each of the restructured loan 
populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. 
Also included in management™s estimates for loan and lease 
losses are considerations with respect to
 the impact of current economic events, 
the outcomes of which are uncertain. These 
events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that may 
directly or indirectly affect the banking
 industry and economic conditions affectin
g specific geographical areas and industries
 in which BB&T conducts business.  

 The methodology used to determine an es
timate for the RUFC is inherently simila
r to the methodology used in calculating 
the ALLL adjusted for factors specific to 
binding commitments, including the probability
 of funding and exposure at the time 
of funding. A detailed discussion of th
e methodology used in determining the A
LLL and the RUFC is included in Note 1 
ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Policiesﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.ﬂ 

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The vast majority of assets and liabilities carried at fair value ar
e based on either quoted market prices or market prices for
 similar instruments. See Note 18 ﬁFair Value Disclosuresﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ herein for 

additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. 

 Securities 
 
BB&T generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determin
ing the fair value of its AFS and trading securities. Fair 
value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include 

benchmark yields, benchmark securities, 
reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. Management 
performs various procedures to evaluate the accuracy of the fa
ir values provided by the thir
d-party service provider. These 
procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible LOB, include comparison of pricing information received 

from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing 
sources, review of additional information provided by the thi
rd 
party pricing service and other third party sources for selected
 securities and back-testing to 
compare the price realized on 
any security sales to the daily pricing information received fr
om the third party pricing serv
ice. The IPV committee, which 
provides oversight to BB&T™s enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for oversight of the comparison of pricing 
information received from the third party pricing service to 
other third party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits 
determined by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewi
ng significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and 
reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illi
quid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable 
data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack 
of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the securit
y is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management.  
 BB&T periodically reviews AFS securities with
 an unrealized loss. An unrealized loss
 exists when the current fair value of 
an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Th
e purpose of the review is to co
nsider the length of time and t
he extent to which the market value of a security has been be
low its amortized cost. The primary factors BB&T considers in 
determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary 
are long-term expectations an
d recent experience regarding 
principal and interest payments and BB&T™s intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be 
required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis. 
     
84 
 MSRs 
 BB&T has a significant mortgage loan servicing portfolio with
 two classes of MSRs for which it separately manages the 

economic risk: residential and commercial. Re
sidential MSRs are primarily carried at fair value with changes in fair value 
recorded as a component of mortgage banking income. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income 

statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of its residential MSRs. MSRs 

do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable
 prices. While sales of MSRs do
 occur, the precise terms and 
conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, BB&
T estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using an OAS 
valuation model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest 
rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted 
rates. The OAS model considers portfolio 
characteristics, contractually specified 
servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, 
delinquency rates, late charges, other an
cillary revenue, costs to se
rvice and other economic f
actors. BB&T reassesses and 
periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions 
that a market participant would consider in valuing the MSR asset.  
 
Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industr
y surveys, recent market activ
ity, actual portfolio experience 
and, when available, observable market da
ta. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, MSRs are classified within Level 3 of 
the valuation hierarchy. The value of MSRs 
is significantly affected by mortgage in
terest rates available in the marketplace, 
which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs 
declines due to increasin
g prepayments attributable to increased mortgage
-refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of 
rising interest rates, the value of MSRs generally increases
 due to reduced refinance activity. Commercial MSRs are carried 
at the lower of cost or market
 and amortized over the estimated period that serv
icing income is expected to be received based 
on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. The amount and timing of servicing asset 
amortization is based on actual results and updated projections. Refer to Note 7 ﬁLoan Servicingﬂ in the ﬁNotes to 

Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ for quantitative disclosu
res reflecting the effect that changes in management™s 
assumptions would have on the fair value of MSRs.  

 
LHFS 
 BB&T originates certain mortgage loans for sale to investors that
 are carried at fair value. Th
e fair value is primarily based 
on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar type
s of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as a 
component of mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs are recognized in noninterest expense when 

incurred. The changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in 
the fair value of servicing associated with the LHFS. BB&T uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic 
effect of changes in fair va
lue of the underlying loans. 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities  
 
BB&T uses derivatives to manage various financial risks. The fa
ir values of derivative financial instruments are determined 
based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models 
that are primarily sensitive to market observable data. BB&T 
mitigates the credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit 
reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans 
and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterp
arties are required to provide collateral to BB&T when their 
unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair
 value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related 
to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that BB&T does not expect to 

fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. 
 Private Equity and Similar Investments  

 BB&T has private equity and similar investment
s that are carried at fair value. Change
s in the fair value of these investments 
are recorded in other noninterest income
 each period. In many cases there are no observable market values for these 
investments and management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the 

company to multiples in the marketplace for 
similar entities. This analysis requires si
gnificant judgment, and actual values in
 a sale could differ materially from those estimated. As of D
ecember 31, 2014, BB&T had $329 million of these investments, 
which represented less than 1% of total assets. 
     
85 
 Intangible Assets  
 The acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets
 and liabilities are recorded at 
their fair values. This ofte
n involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal
 valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other 
valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Th
e amortization of identified intangible assets is based upon th
e estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also 
subjective. Acquisitions typically result in goodw
ill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair
 values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill 
relates. Refer to Note 1 ﬁSummary of Significant Accounting Po
liciesﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated Financial Statementsﬂ 
for a description of the impairment testing process. Manageme
nt considers the sensitivity of the significant assumptions in its
 impairment analysis including consideration of a 10% change 
in estimated future cash flows or the discount rate for each 
reporting unit. 

 Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations  
 BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related 
expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to 
management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption used to 

measure the postretirement benefit obligations
 is set by reference to a high-quality (A
A-rated or higher) corporate bond yield 
curve and the individual characteristics of
 the plans such as projected cash flow 
patterns and payment durations. Management 
evaluated the sensitivity changes that the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense 

for 2015. A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $26 
million for 2015, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of 
approximately $43 million in pension expense for 2015. Refer to Note 14 ﬁBenefit Plansﬂ in the ﬁNotes to Consolidated 

Financial Statementsﬂ for disclosure
s related to BB&T™s benefit plans. 
 
Income Taxes  
 The calculation of BB&T™s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. As part of the 
Company™s analysis and implementation of business strategies, consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that 

apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any tax pos
ition under evaluation. For tax positions that are uncertain in 
nature, management determines whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. For tax 

positions that meet this threshold, management then estimates
 the amount of the tax benefit to recognize in the financial 
statements. Management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the Company™s 

overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as 

necessary.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  
Management™s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and 
Procedures 
 Management of BB&T is responsible for establishing and mainta
ining adequate internal control over financial reporting as 
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fina
ncial reporting and the preparation of financial statements fo
r external purposes in accorda
nce with GAAP. BB&T™s internal control over fi
nancial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, 
that in reasonable detail, acc
urately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and disposition of the Company™s assets; (2) provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit the preparation of 
the financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP and that recei
pts and expenditures 
of the Company are being made only in accordance with the au
thorizations of BB&T™s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely de
tection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company™s assets that could have a mate
rial impact on the financial statements. 
 
Because of its inherent limitations, intern
al control over financial reporting may not
 prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods 
are subject to the risk that co
ntrols may become inadequate 
due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of comp
liance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Company conducted an
 evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting 
based on the framework in ﬁInternal ControlŠIntegrated Framework (2013)ﬂ promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the ﬁCOSOﬂ criteria. Based on this evaluation under 
the COSO criteria, management 
concluded that the internal co
ntrol over financial reporting wa
s effective as of December 31, 
2014. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the management of the Company, under the supervision and with the 

participation of the Company™s Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the 
Company™s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, 

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer conclude
d that the Company™s disclosure controls and procedures are 
effective. 

 
There was no change in the Company™s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 
2014 that has materially affected, or is likely to materially 
affect, the Company™s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting. 
 The effectiveness of the Compan
y™s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independe
nt registered public accounting firm, 
as stated in their accompanying report, 
which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company™s internal control over financial reporting as of 

December 31, 2014.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS AND SU
PPLEMENTARY DATA 
  Report of Independent Regi
stered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BB&T Corporation:  
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, 
comprehensive income, changes in shareholde
rs™ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of BB&T Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 
31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and 
their cash flows for each of the three year
s in the period ended December 31, 2014 
in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of 
America. Also in our opinion, the Compan
y maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in 
Internal 
ControlŠIntegrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO). The Company™s management is resp
onsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control 
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectivene
ss of internal control over financial reporting, included in 
the 
accompanying Management™s Report on Intern
al Control Over Financial Reporting. Ou
r responsibility is to
 express opinions 
on these financial statements and on the 
Company™s internal control over financial 
reporting based on our integrated audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance 
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 

financial statements are free of material
 misstatement and whether effective inte
rnal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence 

supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant 

estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financia
l statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of intern
al control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the 
assessed risk. Our audits also included pe
rforming such other procedures as we co
nsidered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

 
A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with general
ly accepted accounting principles. A co
mpany™s internal control over financial repo
rting includes those policies and procedures 
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasona
ble detail, accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(ii) provide reasonab
le assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements
 in accordance with generally accepted acc
ounting principles, an
d that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding preven
tion or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company™s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, intern
al control over financial reporting may not
 prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods 
are subject to the risk that co
ntrols may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that
 the degree of compliance with the po
licies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTE 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  General 
 See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report for terms used throughout the consolidated financial 
statements and related notes of this Form 10-K. 

 The accounting and reporting policies are 
in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, wher
e applicable, the policies conform to 
the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The following is a summary of the more 
significant accounting policies. 
 Nature of Operations 
 BB&T is a FHC organized under the laws of North Carolina. BB&T conducts operations through a bank subsidiary, Branch 
Bank, and nonbank subsidiaries. Branch Bank has offices in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, 
Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee, Washington DC and Indiana. BB&T provides a wide range 
of banking services to individuals, businesses and municipalitie
s. BB&T offers a variety of loans and lease financing to 
individuals and entities primarily within BB&T™s geographic fo
otprint, including insurance premium financing; permanent 
CRE financing arrangements; loan servicing for third-party investors; direct consumer finance loans to individuals; credit 

card lending; automobile financing; factoring and equipment financing. BB&T also markets a wide range of other services, 

including deposits; discount and full service brokerage, annu
ities and mutual funds; life insurance, property and casualty 
insurance, health insurance and commercial general liability insurance on an agency basis and through a wholesale insurance 

brokerage operation; trust and retirement services; comprehensiv
e wealth advisory services; asset management and capital 
markets services.  
 Principles of Consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements in
clude the accounts of BB&T Corporation and 
those subsidiaries that are majority 
owned by BB&T or over which BB&T exercises control. Inte
rcompany accounts and trans
actions are eliminated in 
consolidation. The results of operations of companies or as
sets acquired are included from the dates of acquisition. All 
material wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiari
es are consolidated unless GAAP requires otherwise. 
 BB&T holds investments in certain legal entities that are consid
ered VIEs. VIEs are 
legal entities in which equity investors 
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to independently finance its activities, or as a group, the holders of the
 equity investment at risk lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most 

significantly impact its economic 
performance, or do not have the obligation to ab
sorb the expected losses of the entity or the
 right to receive expected residual returns of the entity. Consolid
ation of a VIE is required if a reporting entity is the prima
ry 
beneficiary of the VIE. 

 Investments in VIEs are evaluated to determine if BB&T is 
the primary beneficiary. This
 evaluation gives appropriate 
consideration to the design of the entity and the variability that the entity was designed to pass along, the relative power of
 each party, and to BB&T™s relativ
e obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns of the entity, in relation to such 
obligations and rights held by each party. BB&T holds a vari
able interest in its Tender Op
tion Bond program trusts, which 
allow for tax-advantaged financing of certain debt instrument
s issued by tax-exempt entities. As of December 31, 2014, 
BB&T was considered the primary beneficiar
y of the Tender Option Bond program tr
usts, resulting in the consolidation of 
approximately $1.9 billion of assets and $1.7 billion of liabi
lities. BB&T also has variable interests in certain entities that
 were not required to be consolidated, including affordable housing partnership interests, historic tax credit partnerships and 

other partnership interests. Refer to Note 15 ﬁCommitments and Contingenciesﬂ for additional disclosures regarding BB&T™s 
significant VIEs. 

 BB&T accounts for unconsolidated partnerships and similar investments using the equity method of accounting. BB&T 
records its portion of income or loss in other noninterest 
income in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income. These 
investments are periodically evaluated for impairment. BB&T also has investments in, and future funding commitments to, 

private equity investments, which are accounted for based on BB&T™s ownership and control rights specific to each 

investment. 
     
94 
 Reclassifications  Certain amounts reported in prior periods™ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current 
presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported cash flows, shareholders™ equity or net income. 
 Use of Estimates in the Prepar
ation of Financial Statements 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and di
sclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date o
f the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are pa
rticularly susceptible to significant change include the 
determination of the ACL, determination of fair value for fina
ncial instruments, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and 
other purchase accounting related 
adjustments, benefit plan obligations and ex
penses, and tax assets, liabilities and expense. 
 Business Combinations 
 BB&T accounts for business combinations using the acquisition 
method of accounting. The accounts of an acquired entity 
are included as of the date of acquisition, and any excess of purc
hase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is 
capitalized as goodwill. 
 
BB&T typically issues common stock and/or pays cash for an acquisition, depending on the terms of the acquisition 
agreement. The value of common shares issued
 is determined based on the market price of the stock as of the closing of the 
acquisition. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and Federal funds sold and 
securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arra
ngements. Cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three 
months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash represents amounts posted as 
collateral for derivatives in a loss position.  
 Securities  BB&T classifies marketable investment securities as HTM, AFS 
or trading. Interest income 
and dividends on securities are 
recognized in income on an accrual basis. Premiums and disc
ounts on debt securities are amortized as an adjustment to 
interest income using the interest method. 
 
Debt securities are classified as HTM wh
ere BB&T has both the intent and ability to 
hold the securities to maturity. These 
securities are reported at amortized cost. 

 
Debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity needs ar
ising from unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations, changes 
in regulatory capital requirements, or unforeseen changes in 
market conditions, are classified as AFS. AFS securities are 
reported at estimated fair value, with 
unrealized gains and losses reported in AOCI
, net of deferred income taxes, in the 
shareholders™ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 Gains or losses realized from the sale of AFS securities are 
determined by specific identification and are included in noninterest income. 
 
Each HTM and AFS security in a loss position is evaluated for 
OTTI. BB&T considers such factor
s as the length of time and 
the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost, long term expectations and recent experience regarding 

principal and interest payments, BB&T™s intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the Company would be 
required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery 
of the amortized cost basis. Th
e credit component of an OTTI 
loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component is
 recognized in AOCI in s
ituations where BB&T does not 
intend to sell the security and it is more-likely-than-not that 
BB&T will not be required to sell the security prior to recover
y. Subsequent to recognition of OTTI, an increase in expected cash 
flows is recognized as a yield 
adjustment over the remaining 
expected life of the security based on an 
evaluation of the nature of the increase. 
     
95 
 Trading account securities, which include both debt and equity s
ecurities, are reported at fair value. Unrealized market value 
adjustments, fees, and realized gains or
 losses from trading account activities (det
ermined by specific identification) are 
included in noninterest income. Interest income on trading account
 securities is included in interest on other earning assets. 
 LHFS 
 BB&T accounts for new originations of prime residential and 
commercial mortgage LHFS at fair value. BB&T accounts for 
the derivatives used to economically hedge the LHFS at fair value. The fair value of LHFS is primarily based on quoted 
market prices for securities collateralized by similar types of lo
ans. Direct loan origination fees and costs related to LHFS a
re not capitalized and are recorded as mortgage banking income in
 the case of the direct loan 
origination fees and primarily 
personnel expense in the case of the direct loan origination cost
s. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are included in
 mortgage banking income. Gains and losses on sales of commercial LHFS are included in other noninterest income. 
 BB&T sells a significant portion of its fixe
d-rate commercial and conforming residential mortgage loan originations, which 
are typically converted into MBS by FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA and subsequently sold to other third party investors. 
BB&T records these transactions as a sale
 when the transferred loans are legally isolated from BB&T™s creditors and the 
other accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses reco
rded on these transactions are 
based in part on the net carry
ing amount of the loans sold, which is allocated between the loans sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values 
at the date of sale. BB&T generally retains the mortgage servici
ng on loans sold. Since quoted market prices are not typically 
available, BB&T estimates the fair value of these retained in
terests using modeling techniques to determine the net present 
value of expected future cash flows. Su
ch models incorporate management™s best estimates of key variables, such as 
prepayment speeds, servicing costs and discount rates, that would be used by market participants based on the risks involved. 
 
Gains on residential mortgage loan sales, including marking 
LHFS to fair value and the impact of interest rate lock 
commitments, are recorded in noninterest income as a comp
onent of mortgage banking income. For certain of these 
transactions, the loan servicing rights were retained, 
including the related MSRs and on-going servicing fees. 
 BB&T also issues standard representatio
ns and warranties related to mortgage loan sales to GSEs. Although these 
agreements often do not specify limitations, management does
 not believe that any payments related to these warranties 
would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of BB&T. 

 Loans and Leases 
 The Company™s accounting methods for loans 
differ depending on whether the loans are originated or acquired, and if 
acquired, whether or not the acquired loans reflect credit deterior
ation since the date of origination such that it is probable
 at the date of acquisition that BB&T will be unable 
to collect all contractually required payments. 
 Originated Loans and Leases 
 
Loans and leases that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstandin
g principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, and unamortized fees and costs. The net amount of 
nonrefundable loan origination f
ees and certain direct costs associated with th
e lending process are deferred and amortized to 
interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method. 
 BB&T classifies loans and leases as past due when the paymen
t of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is 
greater than 30 days delinquent or if one payment is past du
e. When commercial loans are pl
aced on nonaccrual status as 
described below, a charge-off is recorded, as applicable, to
 decrease the carrying value of 
such loans to the estimated 
recoverable amount. Consumer loans are subject to mandatory charge-off at a specified delinquency date consistent with 
regulatory guidelines. As such, consumer lo
ans are subject to collateral valuation and 
charge-off, as applicable, when they are
 moved to nonaccrual status as described below.   
 Purchased Loans 
 
Purchased loans are recorded at their fair
 value at the acquisition date. Credit discounts are included in the determination of
 fair value; therefore, an ALLL is 
not recorded at the acquisition date. 
     
96 
 Acquired loans are evaluated upon acquisition and classified 
as either purchased impaired
 or purchased non-impaired. 
Purchased impaired loans reflect credit deterioration since orig
ination such that it is probable at acquisition that BB&T will 
be unable to collect all contractually required payments. For purchased impaired loans, expected cash flows at the acquisition 
date in excess of the fair value of loans 
are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans using a level yield method
 if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably esti
mable. Subsequent to the acqui
sition date, increases in cash 
flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income. Decreases in expected cash 

flows due to credit deterioration are reco
gnized by recording an ALLL. For purcha
sed non-impaired lo
ans, the difference 
between the fair value and UPB of the loan at the acquisition 
date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the 
estimated life of the loans using a method that approximates the interest method. 

 TDRs 
 
Modifications to a borrower™s debt agreement are considered TD
Rs if a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons 
related to a borrower™s financial difficulties that otherwise woul
d not be considered. TDRs are undertaken in order to improve 
the likelihood of recovery on the loan and may take the form of modifications made with the stated interest rate lower than 
the current market rate for new debt with 
similar risk, other modifications to the structure of the loan that fall outside of 
normal underwriting policies and 
procedures, or in certain limited circumstan
ces forgiveness of principal or interest. 
Modifications of loans acquired from the FDIC that are part of a pool accounted for as a single asset are not considered 

TDRs. TDRs can involve loans remaining on
 nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or c
ontinuing on accruing
 status, depending 
on the individual facts and circumstances of
 the borrower. In circumstan
ces where the TDR involves 
charging off a portion of 
the loan balance, BB&T typically cla
ssifies these TDRs as nonaccrual. 
 In connection with commerci
al TDRs, the decision to maintain a loan that has 
been restructured on accrual status is based on 
a current, well documented credit evaluation of the borrower™s 
financial condition and prospects for repayment under the 
modified terms. This evaluation includes 
consideration of the borrower
™s current capacity to pay, which among other things 
may include a review of the borrower™s current financial st
atements, an analysis of cash flow available to pay debt 
obligations, and an evaluation of secondary sources of payment from the client and any guarantors. This evaluation also 
includes an evaluation of the borrower™s current willingness to pa
y, which may include a review of past payment history, an 
evaluation of the borrower™s w
illingness to provide information on a timely basi
s, and consideration of offers from the 
borrower to provide additional collateral or guarantor support. The credit evaluation may also include review of cash flow 

projections, consideration of the adequacy of collateral to c
over all principal and interest and trends indicating improving 
profitability and collectability of receivables. 

 The evaluation of mortgage and consumer loans includes an evaluation of the client™s debt to income ratio, credit report, 

property value, loan vintage, and certain other client-specific factors that impact their ability to make timely principal and 
interest payments on the loan. 
 
Nonaccrual commercial TDRs may be return
ed to accrual status based on a current, 
well-documented credit evaluation of the 
borrower™s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the modified terms. This evaluation must include 

consideration of the borrower™s sustained historical repayment 
performance for a reasonable pe
riod (generally a minimum of 
six months) prior to the date on which the loan is returned to
 accrual status. Sustained histori
cal repayment performance for a
 reasonable time prior to the TDR may be taken into account. In connection with retail TDRs, a NPL will be returned to 

accruing status when current as to princi
pal and interest and upon a sustained hist
orical repayment performance (generally a 
minimum of six months). 
 TDR classification may be removed for a loan upon the occurrence of a non-concessionary subsequent modification that is at 

market terms and within current underwriting guidelines. 
 NPAs 
 NPAs include NPLs and foreclosed property. 
Foreclosed property consists of real es
tate and other assets acquired as a result 
of customers™ loan defaults. BB&T™s po
licies for placing loans on nonaccrual status
 conform to guidelines prescribed by 
bank regulatory authorities. The majority of commercial loans and leases 
are placed on nonaccrual st
atus when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, or generally
 when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, whicheve
r occurs first. Other lending subsidiaries™ 
loans, which includes both 
consumer and commercial lo
ans, are placed on nonaccrual 
status generally when principal and interest becomes 90 days past due. Direct retail, mortgage and sales finance loans are 
placed on nonaccrual status at varying intervals, based on the ty
pe of product, generally when 
principal and interest becomes 
between 90 days and 180 days past due. Loans acquired from the FDIC are considered to be performing due to the 
application of the expect
ed cash flows method. 
     
97 
 Residential mortgage NPLs secured by 1-4 family properties are generally charged down to the fair value of the collateral 
securing the loan less costs to sell upon becoming 180 days past due, unless the shortfall is covered by private mortgage 
insurance. Nonperforming residential mortgage TDRs generally 
incur charge-offs at 120 days. If a known loss is identified 

prior to these time periods, the applicable charge-off occurs immediately. BB&T recognizes charge-offs on government 
guaranteed NPLs to the extent that the carryin
g value of the NPL exceeds the guaranteed amount.  
 Charge-offs are recorded on revolving cred
it loans after they become 180 days past
 due and commercial bank card balances 
after they become 90 days past due. Unpaid fees and finance charges are reversed against interest income in period in which 

the charge-off occurs. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4 family properties are charged down to the fair value of the 

collateral securing the loan less costs to sell upon becoming between 90 and 120 days past due, depending on the type of 
loan.  
 Secured consumer loans discharged
 through bankruptcy are charged down to the 
fair value of the related collateral, and the 
remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status.  
 Certain loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual st
atus if management determines that it does not have concern 
over the collectability of principal and in
terest. Generally, when loans are placed 
on nonaccrual status, accrued interest 
receivable is reversed against interest income in the current pe
riod. Interest payments received
 thereafter are applied as a 
reduction to the remaining principal balance as long as conc
ern exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal. 
Nonaccrual mortgage loans are accounted fo
r using the cash basis. Loans and leases
 are generally removed from nonaccrual 
status when they become current as to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectability of 

principal and interest. 
 
Assets acquired as a result of foreclosure 
are subsequently carried at th
e lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizabl
e value equals fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of
 cost over net realizable value at the time of foreclosure i
s charged to the ALLL. NPAs are subject to 
periodic revaluations of the collateral underlying impaired loans and foreclosed 
real estate. The periodic revaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional 
liquidity adjustments based upon the expected retention period. BB&T™s policies require that valuations be updated at least 
annually and that upon foreclosure, the valuation must not be more than six months old, otherwise an updated appraisal is 

required. Routine maintenance costs, other costs of ownership, s
ubsequent declines in market value and net losses on disposal 
are included in foreclosed property expense. 

 ACL  The ACL includes the ALLL and the RUFC. 
The ACL represents management™s best estimate of probable credit losses 
inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates for 
loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical lo
an and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to 
charge-off experience, current tr
ends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on purchased loans, current 
assessment of problem loans and leases, the 
results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk 
assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. As part of this pro
cess, BB&T develops a series of loss estimate factors, which are
 modeled projections of the frequency, timing and severity of losses. Changes to the ACL are made by charges to the 
provision for credit losses, which is reflected in the Consolidated
 Statements of Income. Loan or
 lease balances deemed to be 
uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL. Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. The 
methodology used to determine the RUFC is inherently sim
ilar to that used to determine the collectively evaluated 
component of the ALLL, adjusted for factors specific to bi
nding commitments, including the probability of funding and 
exposure at default. While management uses the best information available to establish the ACL, future adjustments may be 

necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in computing the ACL or, if required by 
regulators based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. 
 
Accounting standards require the presenta
tion of certain disclosure information at the portfolio segment level, which 
represents the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its ACL. BB&T 

concluded that its loan and lease portfolio consists of thre
e portfolio segments; 
commercial, retail and acquired from FDIC. 
The commercial portfolio segm
ent includes CRE, commercial and industrial an
d other loans originated by certain other 
lending subsidiaries, and was identified based on the risk-based ap
proach used to estimate the ALLL for the vast majority of 
these loans. The retail portfolio segment includes direct retail 
lending, revolving credit, residential mortgage, sales finance
 and other loans originated by certain reta
il-oriented subsidiaries, and was identified based on the delinquency-based approach 
used to estimate the ALLL. The acquired from FDIC portfolio segment was identified based on the expected cash flows 

approach used to estimate the ALLL. 
     
98 
 A portion of the ALLL may not be allocat
ed to any specific category 
of loans. Any unallocated portion of the ALLL reflects 
management™s best estimate of the elements of imprecision and estimation risk inherent in the calculation of the overall 
ALLL. During 2013, BB&T incorpor
ated these elements into the ALLL determin
ation for each loan category such that there 
is not an unallocated ALLL as 
of December 31, 2014 or 2013. 
 
The entire amount of the ACL is available to absorb losses on any loan category or lending-related commitment. 

 The following provides a description of 
accounting policies and methodologies rela
ted to each of the 
portfolio segments: 
 Commercial 
 
The vast majority of loans in the commercial lending portfolio 
are assigned risk ratings based on an assessment of conditions 
that affect the borrower™s ability to meet contractual obligations under the loan agreement. This process includes reviewing 

borrowers™ financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other 

information specific to each borrower. Risk ratings are reviewed
 on an annual basis for all credit relationships with total 
credit exposure of $1 million or more, or at any point management becomes aware of information affecting the borrowers™ 

ability to fulfill their obligations. 

 Risk Rating  Description 
 Pass  Loans not considered to be problem credits 

Special Mention  Loans that have a potential weakness deserving management™s close attention 
Substandard  Loans for which a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of 
contractual cash flows at risk 
 
For commercial clients with total credit e
xposure less than $1 million, BB&T has developed an automated loan review 
system to identify and proactively manage accounts with a 
higher risk of loss. The ﬁsco
reﬂ produced by this automated 
system is updated monthly. 

 During 2013 and 2012, BB&T reviewed all commercial lending relationships with outstanding debt of $5 million or more 

that were classified as substandard. During
 the first quarter of 2014, this process was revised such that any obligor with an 
outstanding nonaccrual balance of $3 million 
or more is reviewed. While this review
 is largely focused on the borrower™s 
ability to repay the loan, BB&T also considers the capacity and willingness of a loan™s guarantors to support the debt service 
on the loan as a secondary source of 
repayment. When a guarantor exhibits the documented capacity and willingness to 
support the loan, BB&T may consider extending the loan matur
ity and/or temporarily deferring principal payments if the 
ultimate collection of both principal and interest is not in question. In these cases, BB&T may not deem the loan to be 

impaired due to the documented capacity 
and willingness of the guarantor to repay th
e loan. Loans are considered impaired 
when the borrower (or guarantor in certain circumstances) does
 not have the cash flow capacity or willingness to service the 
debt according to contractual terms, or it does not appear reasonable to assume that the 
borrower will continue to pay 
according to the contractual agreement. BB&
T establishes a specific reserve for each 
loan that has been deemed impaired 
based on the criteria outlined above. The amount of the rese
rve is based on the present value of expected cash flows 
discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate and/or the valu
e of collateral, net of costs to sell. In addition, beginning w
ith 
the first quarter of 2014, BB&T reviews any collateral-depend
ent commercial loan balances between $1 million and $3 
million to establish a specific reserve based on the underlying collateral value.  
 BB&T also has a review process related to TDRs and other impa
ired loans that are in commerc
ial lending relationships with 
outstanding debt of less than $1 million at the balance sheet date. In connection with this process, BB&T establishes reserves 
related to these loans that are calculated using an expected
 cash flow approach. These discounted cash flow analyses 
incorporate adjustments to future cash flows 
that reflect management™s best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based 
on a combination of historical experience and management judgment. 

 BB&T also maintains reserves for collective impairment that refl
ect an estimate of losses related to non-impaired commercial 
loans as of the balance sheet date. Em
bedded loss estimates for BB&T™s commercial loan portfolio are based on estimated 
migration rates, which are based on historical experience, and current risk mix as indicated by the risk grading process 
described above. Embedded loss estimates may be adjusted to 
reflect current economic conditions and current portfolio 
trends including credit quality, concentrations, aging of the 
portfolio, and significant policy and underwriting changes. 
     
99 
 Retail 
 The majority of the ALLL related to the retail lending portfolio is calculated on a collective basis using delinquency status, 

which is the primary factor considered in determining whether 
a retail loan should be classified as nonaccrual. Embedded 
loss estimates for BB&T™s retail lending portfolio are based on estimated migration rates that are developed based on 

historical experience, and current risk mix as indicated by prevailing delinquency rates. These estimates may be adjusted to 

reflect current economic conditions and cu
rrent portfolio trends. The remaining portion of the ALLL related to the retail 
lending portfolio relates to loans that have been deemed impair
ed based on their classification as a TDR at the balance sheet 

date. BB&T establishes specific reserves related to these TDRs 
using an expected cash flow 
approach. The ALLL for retail 
TDRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate adjustments to future cash flows that reflect management™s 
best estimate of the default risk related to TDRs based on a combination of historical experience and management judgment. 
 Acquired Loans 
 Purchased impaired loans and all loans acq
uired in an FDIC-assisted transaction ar
e typically aggregated into loan pools 
based upon common risk characteristics. The ALLL for each loan 
pool is based on an analysis 
that is performed each period 
to estimate the expected cash flows. To th
e extent that the expected cash flows of 
a loan pool have decreased due to credit 
deterioration, BB&T establishes an ALLL. For non-FDIC assisted purchased non-impaired loans, BB&T uses an approach 
consistent with that described abov
e for originated loans and leases. 
 Assets Acquired from the FDIC and Re
lated FDIC Loss Share Receivable/Payable 
 Assets labeled ﬁacquired from FDICﬂ include certain loans, secu
rities and other assets that we
re acquired from the FDIC in 
conjunction with the Colonial transaction an
d are subject to one of the loss sharing agreements. The loss sharing agreement 
applicable to single family residential mortgage loans and rela
ted foreclosed property expires in 2019 and provides for loss 
and recovery sharing with the FDIC during its term. Assets subj
ect to the single family loss sharing agreement are referred to 
as ﬁcoveredﬂ assets. Effective October 1, 2014, the loss shar
ing provisions applicable to commercial loans, securities and 
other covered assets expired; however, Branch Bank must re
imburse the FDIC for realized gains and recoveries through 
September 2017. Refer to Note 3 ﬁSecuritiesﬂ and Note 4 ﬁLoans
 and ACLﬂ for additional information. The FDIC loss share 
receivable includes amounts related to net re
imbursements expected to be received fro
m the FDIC and is included in Other 
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recognized amounts related to expected future payments  to the FDIC, 
including any amounts resulting from the aggregate loss calcula
tion, are included in Accounts
 payable and other liabilities. 
 
The FDIC™s obligation to reimburse Branch Bank with respect 
to loss sharing agreements began with the first dollar of loss 
incurred by BB&T on the covered assets. Covered assets, excluding certain non-agency MBS,
 are subject to a stated 
threshold of $5 billion that provides for the FDIC to reimburse Br
anch Bank for (1) 80% of cumulative net losses incurred up 
to $5 billion and (2) 95% of net losses in excess of $5 billion. 
Gains and recoveries on covered 
assets will offset losses, or 
be paid to the FDIC, at the applicable loss share percentage in 
effect at the time of gain/recove
ry. Losses and gains on certain 
non-agency MBS are to be shared with the 
FDIC at 95% of such losses/gains.  At th
e conclusion of the loss share period in 
2019, should actual aggregate 
losses, excluding securities, be less than an
 amount determined in accordance with these 
agreements, BB&T will pay the FDIC
 a portion of the difference. 
 
The income statement effect of the ch
anges in the FDIC loss share receivabl
e/payable includes the accretion due to 
discounting and changes in expected net reimbursements. Decreases in expected net reimbursements, including the amounts 
expected to be paid to the FDIC as a re
sult of the aggregate loss calculation, are re
cognized in income prospectively over the 
term of the loss share agreements consiste
nt with the approach taken to recognize in
creases in cash flows on acquired loans. 
Increases in expected reimbursements are recognized in income in
 the same period that the provision for credit losses for the 
related loans is recognized. S
ubsequent to the recognition of ALLL related to 
specific assets, any decr
ease in expected net 
reimbursement would be recognized in income in the same period
 that the provision for loan losses for the related loans is 
released. 
     
100 
 Premises and Equipment  Premises, equipment, capital leases and leasehold improvemen
ts are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
amortization. Land is stated at cost. In addition, purchased software and costs of computer software developed for internal 
use are capitalized provided certain criteria are met. Depr
eciation and amortization are computed principally using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms, including certain renewals that were deem
ed probable at lease inception
, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Capitalized 
leases are amortized using the same methods as premises and 
equipment over the estimated useful lives or lease terms, whic
hever is less. Obligations under capital leases are amortized 
using the interest method to allocate payments between principal reduction and interest expense. Rent expense and rental 

income on operating leases is record
ed using the straight-line method 
over the appropriate lease terms. 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 Federal funds purchased represent unsecured borrowings from 
other banks and generally mature daily. Securities sold under 
repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized primarily 
by securities of the U.S. government or its agencies and 
generally have maturities ranging from 1 day to 36 months. 
The terms of repurchase agreements may require BB&T to 
provide additional collateral if the fair value of the securities 
underlying the borrowings declines during the term of the 
agreement. Master notes are unse
cured, non-negotiable obligations of BB&T (varia
ble rate commercial paper) that mature in 
270 days or less. Other short-term borrowed funds include unsecured bank notes that mature in less than one year and bank 
obligations with a seven day put option that are collateralized 
by municipal securities. These amounts are reflected as short-
term borrowings on the Consolidated Bala
nce Sheets and are recorded based on th
e amount of cash received in connection 
with the borrowing.  

 Income Taxes 
 Deferred income taxes have been provided when different acco
unting methods have been used in determining income for 
income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes. Deferr
ed tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future 
tax consequences attributable to differences between the fina
ncial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and thei
r tax bases. In the event of changes in the tax laws, deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enact
ment 
of those changes, with the cumulative effects included in the 
current year™s income tax provision. Net deferred tax liabilities
 are included in accounts payable and other liab
ilities in the Consolidat
ed Balance Sheets. 
 Interest and penalties related to income taxes are recognized
 as a component of the provision for income taxes in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying 
instrument, index or referenced interest 
rate. These instruments include interest rate swaps, caps, floors, collars, financial 
forwards and futures contracts, swaptions, when-issued secu
rities, foreign exchange contracts and options written and 
purchased. BB&T uses derivatives primarily to manage econom
ic risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and 
mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding so
urces. BB&T also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions 
on behalf of its clients. The fair value of derivatives in a 
gain or loss position is included in other assets or liabilities, 
respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral posted for derivative instruments in a loss position is 

included in restricted cash on th
e Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 BB&T classifies its derivative financial instruments as either (1
) a hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recorded asset or liability (ﬁfair value hedgeﬂ), (2) a hedge of 
an exposure to changes in the cash flows of a recognized asset
, liability or forecasted transaction (ﬁcash flow
 hedgeﬂ), (3) a hedge of a net investment
 in a subsidiary, or (4) derivatives no
t designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
 not designated as hedges are 
recognized in current period 
earnings. BB&T has master netting agreements with the derivativ
es dealers with which it does business, but BB&T presents 

gross assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     
101 
 BB&T uses the long-haul method to assess hedge effectivene
ss. BB&T documents, both at inception and over the life of the 
hedge, at least quarterly, its analysis of 
actual and expected hedge effectiveness. Th
is analysis includes techniques such as 
regression analysis and hypothetical derivatives to demonstrate that the hedge has been, and is expected to be, highly 
effective in off-setting corresponding changes in the fair valu
e or cash flows of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges 
involving interest rate caps and collars, this analysis also 
includes consideration of whether critical terms match, the strike
 price of the hedging option matches the specified level beyond (or within) which the entity™s exposure is being hedged, the 

hedging instrument™s inflows (outflows) at its maturity date co
mpletely offset the change in the hedged transaction™s cash 
flows for the risk being hedged and the hedging instrument can be exercised only on its contractual maturity date. For a 

qualifying fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivatives that have been highly effective as hedges are recognized 

in current period earnings along with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the designated hedged item attributable to
 the risk being hedged. For a qualifying cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivatives that have been highly 

effective are recognized in OCI until the related cash flows from
 the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For qualifying 
cash flow hedges involving interest rate caps and collars, the initial fair value of the premium paid is allocated and recogniz
ed 
in the same future period that the hedg
ed forecasted transaction impacts earnings. 
 For either fair value hedges or cash flow he
dges, ineffectiveness may be 
recognized to the extent that changes in the value of 
the derivative instruments do not perfectly 
offset changes in the value of the hedged
 items. If the hedge ceases to be highly 
effective, BB&T discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes the changes in fair value in current period earnings. If a 

derivative that qualifies as a fair value or cash flow hedge is terminated or the designation removed, the realized or then 
unrealized gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of
 the hedged item (fair value hedge) or in the period in which 
the hedged item affects earnings (cash 
flow hedge). Immediate recognition in 
earnings is required upon sale or 
extinguishment of the hedged item (fair value hedge) or if it is 
probable that the hedged cash flows will not occur (cash flow 
hedge). 

 Derivatives used to manage economic risk not designated 
as hedges primarily represent economic risk management 
instruments of MSRs and mortgage banking operations, with gains or losses included in mortgage banking income. In 
connection with its mortgage banking activities, BB&T enters into loan commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at 
specified rates and for specified periods of time. To the extent that BB&T™s interest rate lock commitments relate to loans 
that will be held for sale upon funding, they are also accounted for as derivatives, with gains or losses included in mortgage 

banking income. Gains and losses on other derivatives used to manage economic risk are primarily associated with client 
derivative activity and are included in other income. 
 Credit risk resulting from derivatives aris
es when amounts receivable from a counter
party exceed those payable to the same 
counterparty.  The risk of loss with respect to over-the-counter derivatives, eligible margin loans and repurchase-style 
transactions is addressed by subjecting co
unterparties to a credit review and approval process similar to the process in making
 loans or other extensions of credit and/or by requiring collateral.  

 
Derivative dealer counterparties operate under agreements to 
provide cash and/or highly liquid securities on a daily basis for 
unsecured credit exposure beyond negotiated limits, while clie
nt derivatives that are associated with loans are cross-
collateralized with the loan.   
 BB&T only transacts with dealer counterparties that are national market makers with strong credit standings and requires 
liquid collateral to secure credit exposure.  Due to these factor
s, the fair value of derivatives with dealer counterparties is
 primarily based on the interest rate mark of each trade. The fa
ir value of interest rate derivatives with clients includes a cr
edit 
valuation adjustment. 

 
Collateral obtained to secure margin loans includes equitie
s, corporate and municipal securities, and repurchase-style 
transactions are generally secured by government and agency
 securities.  The value of collateral for margin loans and 
repurchase-style transactions is monitored daily with settlement
 required when changes in value exceed established limits by 
counterparty.  Due to the liquid nature of
 collateral, the frequency of transactions and collateral monitoring, a reserve for 
credit loss is established only when a risk of loss is identified. 

     
102 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
(including identifiable intangibles) in 
transactions accounted fo
r as acquisitions. BB&T allocates goodwill to the re
porting unit(s) that receives significant benefits
 from the acquisition. Goodwill is tested at least annually for im
pairment during the fourth quarter of each year and more 
frequently if circumstances exist that indi
cate a possible reduction in the fair value of the business below its carrying value
. BB&T measures impairment using the present value of estimated future cash flows based upon available information. 
Discount rates are based upon the cost of capital specific to th
e industry in which the reporting unit operates. If the carryin
g value of the reporting unit exceeds 
its fair value, a second analysis is performe
d to measure the fair value of all assets and 
liabilities. If, based on the second analysis, it is determined 
that the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the report
ing unit 
is less than the carrying value, BB&T would recognize impair
ment for the excess of carrying value over fair value. 
 
CDI and other intangible assets include premiums paid for acqui
sitions of core deposits and other identifiable intangible 
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized based upon the 
estimated economic benefits received. 
 MSRs  BB&T has two primary classes of MSRs for which it separately
 manages the economic risks: residential and commercial. 
Residential MSRs are recorded on the Conso
lidated Balance Sheets primarily at fair va
lue with changes in fair value recorded 
as a component of mortgage banking income. Various derivative instruments are used to mitigate the income statement effect 
of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of the residential MSRs. Commercial MSRs are 
recorded as other assets on the Consolidat
ed Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or 
market and are amortized in proportion to, 
and over the estimated period, that net se
rvicing income is expected to be receive
d based on projections of the amount and 
timing of estimated future net cash flows. The amount and timing of estimated future net cash flows are updated based on 

actual results and updated projections. BB&T periodica
lly evaluates its commercial MSRs for impairment. 
 Equity-Based Compensation 
 BB&T maintains various equity-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of stock options (incentive and 
nonqualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance units and performance shares to selected 
employees and directors. BB&T values share-based awards at 
the grant date fair value and 
recognizes the expense over the 
requisite service period taking into account retirement eligibility. 

 Pension and Postretiremen
t Benefit Obligations  
 BB&T offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. Calculation of the obligations and related 
expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions. The discount rate assumption 
used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by 
reference to a high quality corporate bond yield curve and the
 individual characteristics of the pl
an such as projected cash flow patterns and 
payment durations. The expected long-term rate 
of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each 
major asset class in which the pl
an invests, adjusted for the 
weight of each asset class in the target mix. 
 Insurance Income 
 Insurance commission revenue is generally recognized at the la
ter of the billing date or the effective date of the related 
insurance policies. Insurance premiums
 from underwriting activities are recognized
 as income over the policy term. The 
portion of premiums that will be earned in the future is defe
rred and included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
 Sheets.  Segments 
 Segment results are presented based on 
internal management accounting policies that were designed to support BB&T™s 
strategic objectives. The Other, Treasury and Corporate segmen
t includes financial data from subsidiaries below the 
quantitative and qualitative thresholds requiring disclosure. Refer to Note 21 ﬁOperating Segmentsﬂ
 for additional disclosures 
regarding BB&T™s segments. 
     
103 
 Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements 
 In February 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
Consolidation
. The new guidance provides an additional 
requirement for a limited partnership or similar entity to qualif
y as a voting interest entity and also amends the criteria for
 consolidating such an entity. In addition, the new guidance amends the criteria for evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or
 service provider as a variable interest an
d amends the criteria for evaluating the ef
fect of fee arrangements and related parti
es on a VIE primary beneficiary determination. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning 
after December 15, 2015. The Company is 
currently evaluating this guidance to de
termine the impact on its consolidated 
financial statements. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
Receivables. The new guidance requires that a government 
guaranteed mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate 
other receivable be recognized 
upon foreclosure if certain 
conditions are met. This 
guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning 
after December 15, 2014. 
The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions and Repurchase Financings
. The new guidance changes the accounting for repurchase-to-matu
rity transactions to secure
d borrowing accounting. The 
guidance also requires separate accounting for a transfer of a 
financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase 

agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secu
red borrowing accounting for the 
repurchase agreement. This 
guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting peri
ods beginning after December 15
, 2014. The adoption of this 
guidance is not expected to be material 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. This guidance supersedes 
the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, 
Revenue Recognition
, and most 
industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards 
Codification. The guidance requires an entity to recognize 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to 

which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for interim and 
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to 
determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.   

 In January 2014, the FASB issued new guidance related to 
Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects. 
The new 
guidance allows an entity, provided certain criteria are met, 
to elect the proportional amorti
zation method to account for thes
e investments. The proportional amortizati
on method allows an entity to amortize th
e initial cost of the investment in 
proportion to the amount of tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognize the net in
vestment performance in the 
income statement as a component of the provision for income
 taxes. This guidance is effective for interim and annual 
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. See Note
 15 ﬁCommitments and Contin
genciesﬂ for the estimated 
impact of the adoption of this guidance. 
 Effective January 1, 2014
, the Company adopted new guidance related to 
Troubled Debt Restructurings
.  The new guidance 
clarifies the timing of when an in substance repossession or for
eclosure of collateralized residential real property is deemed 
to 
have occurred and also requires disclosure of the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property and the recorded 

investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residentia
l real estate property that ar
e in the process of foreclosure
. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Effective January 1, 2014
, the Company adopted new guidance related to 
Investment Companies. 
The new guidance amends 
the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company 
and requires an investment company to measure all of its 
investments at fair value. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 NOTE 2. Business Combinations
  During 2014, BB&T purchased 21 bank branches in Texas from Citigroup, Inc., resulting in the acquisition of $1.2 billion in 
deposits, $112 million in loans and $1.1 billion in cash an
d other assets. Goodwill of $29 million and CDI of $20 million 
were recognized in connection with the transaction. 

 During 2012, BB&T completed the acquisition of Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida-based BankAtlantic. BB&T acquired 
approximately $1.7 billion in loans and assumed approximately $3.5 billion in deposits. 
 BB&T has reached agreements to acquire Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., The Bank of Kentucky Financial Corporation and 

additional retail branches in Texas.

   The fair value of securities acquired from the FDIC includ
ed non-agency MBS of $931 million and $1.1 billion as of 
December 31, 2014 and December
 31, 2013, respectively, and state and political
 subdivision securities of $312 million and 
$314 million as of December 31, 2014 
and December 31, 2013. Effective October 1, 2014, securities subject to the 
commercial loss sharing agreement with the FDIC related to the Co
lonial acquisition were no longer covered by loss sharing; 
however, any gains on the sale of these securities through Se
ptember 30, 2017 would be shared with the FDIC. Since these 
securities are in a significant unrealized gain position, they 
continue to be effectively covered as any declines in the 
unrealized gains of the secur
ities down to a contractually specified amount 
would reduce the liability to the FDIC at the 
applicable percentage. The contractually-s
pecified amount is the acquisition date fa
ir value less any paydowns, redemptions 
or maturities and OTTI and totaled approximately $626 milli
on at December 31, 2014. Any further declines below the 
contractually-specified amount would not be covered. 

 
Certain investments in marketable de
bt securities and MBS issued by FNMA
 and FHLMC exceeded ten percent of 
shareholders™ equity at December 31, 2014. The FNMA investments had total amortized cost and fair value of $12.5 billion 

and $12.3 billion, respectively. The FHLMC investments had total amortized cost and fair value of $5.5 billion.

   Periodic reviews are conducted to identify an
d evaluate each investment with an unr
ealized loss for OTTI. 
An unrealized loss 
exists when the current fair value of an individual security is
 less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are 
determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of 
tax, in AOCI for AFS securities. The unrealized losses on GSE 
securities and MBS issued by GSE were the result of increases in
 market interest rates compared to the date the securities 
were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers. 
 
Cash flow modeling is used to evaluate non-agency MBS in an
 unrealized loss position for potential credit impairment. These 
models give consideration to long-term macroeconomic factors ap
plied to current security default rates, prepayment rates and 
recovery rates and security-level perfor
mance. At December 31, 2014, one non-ag
ency MBS had an immaterial amount of 
other than temporary credit impairment. 
 At December 31, 2014, $55 milli
on of the unrealized loss on m
unicipal securities was the result of fair value hedge basis 
adjustments that are a component of amortized cost. Municipa
l securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated for 
credit impairment through a qua
litative analysis of issuer performance and th
e primary source of re
payment. At December 
31, 2014, the evaluation of municipal securities indicated one m
unicipal security had an immaterial amount of other than 
temporary credit impairment. 
 NOTE 4. Loans and ACL 
 During the first quarter of 2014, approximately $8.3 billion of nonguaranteed, closed-end, first and second lien position 
residential mortgage loans, along with the related allowance,
 were transferred from direct
 retail lending to residential 
mortgage to facilitate compliance with a series of new rules re
lated to mortgage servicing associated with first and second 
lien position mortgages collateralized by real estate.  

 During the first quarter of 2014, the CRE
 loan categories were realigned into CRE Œ income producing properties and CRE Œ 
construction and development in order to better reflect the nature of the underlying loans. Prior period data has been 
reclassified to conform to this new presentation.  
 During the third quarter of 2014, approximately $550 million of loans, which were primarily performing residential mortgage 

TDRs, with a related ALLL of $57 million were sold for a gain of $42 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, 
approximately $140 million of loans, which were primarily re
sidential mortgage NPLs, with a related ALLL of $19 million 
were sold for a gain of $24 million. Both gains were recognized as reductions to the provision for credit losses.  

 Effective October 1, 2014, loans subject 
to the commercial loss sharing agreement w
ith the FDIC related to the Colonial 
acquisition were no longer covered by loss sharing. At Decemb
er 31, 2014, these loans had a carrying value of $561 million, 
a UPB of $836 million and an allowance of $38 million and are included in acquired from FDIC loans. Loans totaling $654 

million at December 31, 2014 continue to be covered by loss sharing and are included in the acquired from FDIC balance. 
 During 2013, BB&T sold a consumer lending subsidiary with 
approximately $500 million in loans and $27 million of related 
ALLL. In addition, approximately $230 million of loans, with 
$38 million of related ALLL, was transferred from retail other 
lending subsidiaries to residential mortgage and $47 million of unallocated ALLL was allocated to the loan portfolio 

segments.

    12                           If a TDR subsequently defaults, BB&T evaluates the TDR for possible impairment. As a result, the related ALLL may be 
increased or charge-offs may be taken to
 reduce the carrying value of the loan. 
 Changes in the carrying value and accretabl

 During 2012, BB&T completed the acquisition of Fort Laud
erdale, Florida-based BankAtlantic. The 2012 change in 
Community Banking goodwill was primarily the result of this 
acquisition. Also during 2012, BB&T acquired the life and 
property and casualty insurance divisions of Crump Group In
c. The 2012 changes in Insurance Services goodwill and other 
identifiable intangibles were primarily due to this acquisition. 
 The 2013 adjustments to goodwill within Community Banking and Insurance Services reflect the finalization of valuations 

for certain assets and liabilities of the above acquisitions. The 2
013 adjustment to Specialized Lending primarily represents 
the goodwill associated with a subsidiary that was sold. 

 
During 2014, BB&T purchased 21 bank branches in Texas from Citigroup, Inc., resulting in Community Banking™s acquired 
goodwill above. Also during 2014, the transfer of closed-end, first and second lien position residential mortgage loans from 
Community Banking to Residential Mortgage Banking resulted in a reallocation of the related goodwill, which is included in 

other adjustments in the above table.

   In June 2014, BB&T received a letter from 
the HUD-OIG stating that BB&T has been 
selected for an audit survey to assess 
BB&T™s compliance with FHA requirements related to the orig
ination of loans insured by th
e FHA. In add
ition, HUD-OIG 
will evaluate BB&T™s compliance with FHA requirements related to the implementation of a quality control program 
associated with the origina
tion of FHA-insured loans. In
 November and December of 
2014, BB&T received HUD-OIG 
subpoenas from the Department of Justice seeking additio
nal information related to the HUD-OIG review.  BB&T is 
cooperating and is in the process of responding to these subpoe
nas. While the outcome of the review process is unknown and 
the HUD-OIG has not asserted any claims, similar reviews and re
lated matters with other financial institutions have resulted 
in cash settlements and other remedial actions. BB&T identified a potential exposure related to losses incurred by the FHA 
on defaulted loans that ranges from $25 million to $105 million and recognized an $85 million charge. The income statement 
impact of this adjustment is included in other expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The ultimate resolution of 
this matter is uncertain and the estimates of this exposure ar
e subject to the application of significant judgment and therefor
e cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. 

 
During the year ended December 31, 2014, 
BB&T also recognized a $33 million adju
stment related to the indemnification 
reserves for mortgage loans sold, which represents an increa
se in estimated losses that may be incurred on FHA-insured 
mortgage loans that have not yet defaulted. The income statement impact of this adjustment is included in loan-related 

expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Payments made to date for recourse exposure on residential mortgage loans sold with recourse liability have been immaterial.

 The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not 
be considered to be predictive of future performance. As 
indicated, changes in fair value based on
 adverse changes in assumptions genera
lly cannot be extrapolated because the 
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair 
value may not be linear. Also, in the above table, the effect of
 an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair 
value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other 
assumption; while in reality, changes in one factor may result 
in changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the 
effect of the change.

        Dividends on the preferred stock, if declared, accrue and are 
payable quarterly, in arrears. 
For each issuance, BB&T issued 
depositary shares, each of which represents a fractional ownershi
p interest in a share of the 
Company™s preferred stock. The 
preferred stock has no stated maturity and redemption is solely at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, upon 

the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined. In addition, the preferred stock may be redeemed in whole 
or in part, on any dividend payment date after five years from the date of issuance. Under current rules, any redemption of the
 preferred stock is subject to prior approval of the FRB. The preferred stock is not subject to any sinking fund or other 
obligations of the Company. 
 Equity-Based Compensation Plans  

 At December 31, 2014, options, restricted 
shares and RSUs were outstanding from
 equity-based compensation plans that 
have been approved by shareholders. Those plans are intended to assist the Company in recruiting and retaining employees, 
directors and independent contractors and to associate the interests of eligible participants with those of BB&T and its 

shareholders. 
 The majority of outstanding awards and aw
ards available to be issued relate to 
plans that allow for accelerated vesting of 
awards for holders who retire and have met all retirement eligib
ility requirements or in connection with certain other events.
 Certain of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specifi
ed circumstances until vested that may result in cancellation 
prior to vesting.  
 The following table provides
 a summary of the equity-b
ased compensation plans:

     The fair value of RSUs is based on the common stock price on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends that 

will be foregone during the vesting period. The fair value of options is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes 

option-pricing model. Substantially all aw
ards are granted in February of each 
year. Grants to non-executive employees 
primarily consist of RSUs.

The Company had $210 million, $213 million and $37 million in liabilities for tax-related interest and penalties recorded on 
its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014, 2013
, and 2012, respectively. The amount of net interest and 
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recognized in 
the 2014 and 2012 Consolidated Statements of Income was 
immaterial. The amount of net interest and penalties related to un
recognized tax benefits recogni
zed in the 2013 Consolidated 
Statement of Income was $176 million. 
 
The IRS has completed its Federal income tax examinations
 of BB&T through 2010. Various years remain subject to 
examination by state taxing authorities.

 In February 2010, BB&T received an IRS statutory notice of 
deficiency for tax years 2002-2007 asserting a liability for 
taxes, penalties and interest of approximately $892 million related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits and other 
deductions claimed by a subsidiary in connection with a fina
ncing transaction. BB&T paid the disputed tax, penalties and 
interest in March 2010 and filed a lawsuit seeking a refund in
 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. On September 20, 2013, the 
court denied the refund claim. BB&T appealed the decision to
 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Oral 
arguments were heard in the appeal on Ja
nuary 7, 2015; how
ever, no decision has been rende
red. As of December 31, 2014, 
the exposure for this financing transaction is fully reserved.  
 It is reasonably possible that the litigation associated with th
e financing transaction may conclude within the next twelve 
months; however, further proceedings could delay a final resolution. Changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, 
penalties and interest could result in a benefit of up to approximately $700 million. The ultimate resolution of these matters 
may take longer. 
 NOTE 14. Benefit Plans 
 Defined Benefit Retirement Plans 
 BB&T provides a defined benefit retirement plan qualified under the IRC that covers most employees. Benefits are based on 
years of service, age at retirement and the employee's compen
sation during the five highest consecutive years of earnings 
within the last ten years of employment. 
 In addition, supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain key offi
cers under supplemental defined benefit 

executive retirement plans, which are not qualified under the I
RC. Although technically unfunded plans, a Rabbi Trust and 
insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covere
d employees are available to finance future benefits. 
 The following actuarial assumptions were used to determine net periodic pension costs for the qualified pension plan: 
                                      December 31, 
            2014

     8.00 
      Assumed long-term rate of annual compensation increases 
 5.00 
     4.50 
     4.50 
     The weighted average expected long
-term rate of return on plan assets represents
 the average rate of return expected to be 
earned on plan assets over the period the 
benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expecte
d rate of return, BB&T considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data for each asset category, as 

well as historical actual returns on the plan assets. Using this
 reference information, the Company develops forward-looking 
return expectations for each asset category 
and a weighted average expect
ed long-term rate of retu
rn for the plan based on 
target asset allocations contained in BB&T's Investment Policy Statement. The expected
 rate of return has been reduced to 
7.5% for fiscal 2015. 
 During October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released new mo
rtality tables that reflected longer life expectancies. BB&T 
adopted these tables, which resulted in increases to the projected benefit obligations. 
 Financial data relative to the defined benefit pension plans is summarized in the following tables for the years indicated. The
 qualified pension plan prepaid asset is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of other assets and the 
nonqualified pension plans accrued liability is recorded on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of other 
liabilities. The data is calculated using an actuarial measurement date of December 31.

   BB&T makes contributions to the qualified pension plan in amounts between the minimum required for funding and the 
maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
BB&T made discretionary contributions of $143 million 
during 2014 and $117 million during the first quarter of 2015. Management may make additional contributions in 2015. For 
the nonqualified plans, the employer contributions are based on benefit payments.

   BB&T's primary total return objective is to achieve return
s that, over the long term, will fund retirement liabilities and 
provide for the desired plan benefits in a manner that satisfies
 the fiduciary requirements of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974. The plan assets have a long-term time ho
rizon that runs concurrent with
 the average life expectancy of 
the participants. As such, the Plan can assume a time horizon 
that extends well beyond a full mark
et cycle, and can assume an 
above-average level of risk, as measured by the standard devi
ation of annual return. It is expected, however, that both 
professional investment management and sufficient portfolio diversification will smooth volatility and help to generate a 
reasonable consistency of return. The investments are broadl
y diversified among economic sector, industry, quality and size 
in order to reduce risk and to produce incremental return. Wi
thin approved guidelines and restrictions, investment managers 
have wide discretion over the timing and selection of individual investments. 

 BB&T periodically reviews its asset allocation and investment 
policy and makes changes to its target asset allocation. BB&T 
has established guidelines within each asse
t category to ensure the appropriate balan
ce of risk and reward. For the year ended 
December 31, 2014, the target asset allocati
ons for the plan assets included a range of
 30% to 40% for U.S. equity securities, 
10% to 18% for international equity securities, 35% to 50% 
for fixed income securities, and 0% to 12% for alternative 
investments, which include real estate, hedge funds, private e
quities and commodities, with any remainder to be held in cash 
equivalents. The plan may hold BB&T common stock up to 10% of 
its assets, subject to the target
 range for total U.S. equity 
securities.  
 The fair value of the pension plan assets at December 31, 2
014 and 2013 by asset category ar
e reflected in the following 
tables. The three level fair value hierarchy that describes the inputs used to measure these plan assets is defined in Note 18

million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interna
tional equity securities include a common/commingled fund that 
consists of assets from several accounts, 
pooled together, to reduce management and 
administration costs. Total plan assets 
exclude accrued income of $23 million and $26 milli
on at December 31, 2014

   Defined Contribution Plans 
 BB&T offers a 401(k) Savings Plan and other defined contribution plans that permit employees to contribute from 1% to 
50% of their cash compensation. For full-tim
e employees who are 21 years of age or older with one year or more of service, 
BB&T makes matching contributions of up to 6% of the employee's compensation. BB&T's contribution to the 401(k) 
Savings Plan and nonqualified defined contribution plans totaled $103 million, $102 million and $97 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, resp
ectively. BB&T also offers defined cont
ribution plans to certain employees of 
subsidiaries who do not participate in the 401(k) Savings Plan. 
 Other Benefits 
 There are various other employment contracts, deferred compensation arrangements and covenants not to compete with 
selected members of management and certain retirees. These pl
ans and their obligations are not material to the financial 
statements.

 NOTE 15. Commitments and Contingencies 
 BB&T utilizes a variety of financial instruments to meet the fina
ncing needs of clients and to reduce exposure to fluctuations 
in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitmen
ts to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees
 and derivatives. BB&T also has commitments to fund certain affordable housing investments and contingent liabilities 

related to certain sold loans. 

 Commitments to extend, originate or purc
hase credit are primarily lines of cred
it to businesses and consumers and have 
specified rates and maturity dates. Many
 of these commitments also have advers
e change clauses, which allow BB&T to 
cancel the commitment due to deterioration in the borrowers™ creditworthiness.

   Letters of credit and financial guarantees written are 
unconditional commitments issued by BB&T to guarantee the 
performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support borrowing arrangements, 

including commercial paper issuance, bond financing and similar transactions, the majority of which are to tax exempt 
entities. The credit risk involved in the issuance of these guarantees
 is essentially the same as 
that involved in extending lo
ans 
to clients and as such, the instrume
nts are collateralized when necessary. 
 
BB&T invests in certain affordable housing and historic building rehabilitation projects throughout its market area as a 
means of supporting local communities. BB&
T receives tax credits related to these investments. BB&T typically acts as a 
limited partner in these investments and does not exert control over the operating or financial policies of the partnerships. 
BB&T typically provides financing during the construction and development of the properties; however, permanent financing 
is generally obtained from independent third parties upon completion of a project. Tax credits are subject to recapture by 
taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be
 met at the project level. BB&T™s maximum potential exposure 
to losses relative to investments in VIEs is generally lim
ited to the sum of the outstanding balance, future funding 
commitments and any related loans to the entity. Loans to these 
entities are underwritten in substantially the same manner as 
are other loans and are generally secured.  

 Effective January 1, 2015, BB&T adopted new guidance related to 
Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects.
 The following table summarizes the estimated impact to the Cons
olidated Statements of Income
 that will be reflected in 
future filings.

 BB&T has investments in and future funding commitments to certain private equity and similar investments. BB&T™s risk 
exposure relating to such commitments is generally limited to the amount of investments and future funding commitments 
made. 

 A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying 
instrument, index or interest rate. For additional disclosures 
related to BB&T™s derivatives refer to Note 19 ﬁDerivative 
Financial Instruments.ﬂ 
 BB&T has sold certain mortgage-related loans that contain recourse provisions. These provisions generally require BB&T to 

reimburse the investor for a share of any loss that is incurred 
after the disposal of the property. BB&T also issues standard 
representations and warranties related to mortgage loan sale
s to GSEs. Refer to Note 7 ﬁLoan Servicingﬂ for additional 
disclosures related to these exposures. 
 In the ordinary course of business, BB&T indemnifies its officer
s and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against 
liabilities arising from pending litigation. BB&T also issues standard representations and warranties in underwriting 
agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sale
s, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. 
Counterparties in many of these indemnification arrangements
 provide similar indemnifications to BB&T. Although these 
agreements often do not specify limitations, BB&T does not be
lieve that any payments related to these guarantees would 
materially change the financial position or results of operations of BB&T. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 The nature of BB&T™s business ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims, litigation, investigations and legal and 
administrative cases and proceedings, all of
 which are considered incidental to 
the normal conduct of business. BB&T 
believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with
 respect to such legal proceedings, intend
s to continue to defend itself vigorous
ly, litigating or settling cases according to 
management™s judgment as to what is in the best interests of BB&T and its shareholders. 

 On at least a quarterly basis, liabilities and contingencies in
 connection with outstanding legal proceedings are assessed 
utilizing the latest information available.
 For those matters where it is probable 
that BB&T will incur a loss and the amount 
of the loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability is recorded
 in the consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves
 may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developm
ents on at least a quarterly basis. For other matters, where a 
loss is not probable or the amount of the 
loss is not estimable, legal reserves ar
e not accrued. While the outcome of legal 
proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, advice of counsel and available insurance 
coverage, management believes that the established legal reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from legal 

proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the conso
lidated financial position, consolidated results of operations 
or consolidated cash flows. However, in
 the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate 
resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material 
to the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of 
operations or consolidated cash flows of BB&T. 
 Pledged Assets 

 Certain assets were pledged to secure municipal deposits, s
ecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, borrowings, and 
borrowing capacity, subject to ce
rtain limits, at the FHLB and FRB as well as for 
other purposes as required or permitted by 
law. The following table provides the total carrying amount of
 pledged assets by asset type, of which the majority are 
pursuant to agreements that do not permit the other party to sell or repledge the collateral. Assets related to employee benefi
t plans have been excluded from the following table.

 NOTE 16. Regulatory Requiremen
ts and Other Restrictions 
 Branch Bank is required by the FRB to maintain reserve balances 
in the form of vault cash or deposits with the FRB based on 
specified percentages of certain deposit 
types, subject to various adjustments.
 At December 31, 2014, the net reserve 
requirement amounted to $272 million. 
 
Branch Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit 
the amount of dividends it can pa
y. In addition, both BB&T and 
Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions re
lating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to 
maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to re
main ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ under 
the prompt corrective action 
regulations. BB&T does not expect that any of these laws, regu
lations or policies will materially affect the ability of Branch 
Bank to pay dividends. 

 BB&T is subject to various regulatory capital requirements ad
ministered by the Federal banking
 agencies. Failure to meet 
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatoryŠa
nd possibly additional discretionaryŠactions by regulators 
that, if undertaken, could have a direct 
material effect on the financial statemen
ts. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the
 regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Co
mpany must meet specific cap
ital guidelines that involve 
quantitative measures of assets, liabilities a
nd certain off-balance-sheet items calcula
ted pursuant to regulatory directives. 
BB&T™s capital amounts and classification also are subject to qu
alitative judgments by the regula
tors about components, risk 
weightings and other factors. BB&T is in full compliance with
 these requirements. Banking regulations also identify five 
capital categories for IDIs: well-capitalized, adequately capita
lized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and 
critically undercapitalized. At December 31, 
2014 and 2013, BB&T and Branch Bank we
re classified as ﬁwell-capitalized,ﬂ 
and management believes that no events or changes have occurr
ed subsequent to December 31, 2014 that would change this 
designation. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require BB&T to maintain minimum amounts and 
ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations
) to risk-weighted assets (as de
fined), and of Tier 1 capital 
to 
average tangible assets (leverage ratio). 
 Risk-based capital ratios, which include Tier 1 Capital, Tota
l Capital and Tier 1 Common Equity, are calculated based on 
regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

agencies, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA. At

 The transfer of funds in the form of dividends, loans or advances from bank subsidiaries to the Parent Company is restricted. 
Federal law requires loans to the Parent Company or its affilia
tes to be secured and generally
 limits loans to the Parent 
Company or an individual affiliate to 10% of Branch Bank™s un
impaired capital and surplus. In the aggregate, loans to the 
Parent Company and all affiliates cannot exceed 20% 
of the bank™s unimpaired capital and surplus. 
  Dividend payments to the Parent Company by Branch Bank are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in 

some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends from Branch Bank to the Parent Company are limited by rules 
which compare dividends to net income for regulatory-defined periods. Furthermore, dividends are restricted by regulatory 
minimum capital constraints. 
 NOTE 18. Fair Value Disclosures 
 Accounting standards define fair value as the exchange price th
at would be received on the meas
urement date to sell an asset 
or the price paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market available to the entity in an orderly 

transaction between market participants, with
 a three level valuation input hierarchy. 
 The following tables present fair value information fo
r assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:

   The following discussion focuses on the valuation techniques and significant inputs for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and 
liabilities. 
 
A third-party pricing service is generally utilized in determining the fair value of the securities portfolio. Management 
independently evaluates the fair values provided by the pricing service through comparisons to other third party pricing 
sources, review of additional information provided by the third party pricing service and other third party sources for selecte
d securities and back-testing to comp
are the price realized on any security sales 
to the daily pricing in
formation received from 
the pricing service. Fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using 

observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark secur
ities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker
 quotes. As described by security type below, additional inputs may be used, or some inputs may not be applicable. In the 
event that market observable data was not
 available, which would generally occur due
 to the lack of an active market for a 
given security, the valuation of the security would be subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management. 
 Trading securities:
 Trading securities include various types of debt an
d equity securities, primarily consisting of debt 
securities issued by the U.S. 
Treasury, GSEs, or stat
es and political subdivisions. The valuation techniques used for these 
investments are more fully discussed below. 

 U.S. Treasury securities:
 Treasury securities are valued using quoted 
prices in active over the counter markets.  
 
GSE securities and MBS issued by GSE:
 GSE pass-through securities are valued usin
g market-based pricing matrices that are 
based on observable inputs including benchmark TBA security pricing and yield curves that were estimated based on U.S. 
Treasury yields and certain floating rate indices. The pricing matr
ices for these securities may also give consideration to poo
l-specific data supplied directly by the GSE. GSE CMOs are valu
ed using market-based pricing 
matrices that are based on 
observable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, dealer
 quotes and market research re
ports, the characteristics of a 
specific tranche, market convention prepayment speeds and benchmark yield curves as described above. 
 
States and political subdivisions:
 These securities are valued using market-b
ased pricing matrices that are based on 
observable inputs including MSRB reported trades, issuer spr
eads, material event notices 
and benchmark yield curves. 
 
Non-agency MBS:
 Pricing matrices for these securities are based on obs
ervable inputs including offers, bids, reported trades, 
dealer quotes and market research report
s, the characteristics of a specific tranche,
 market convention prepayment speeds and 
benchmark yield curves as described above. 
    
136 
  Other securities:
 These securities consist primarily of mutual funds an
d corporate bonds. These securities are valued based 
on a review of quoted market prices for assets as well as through the various other inputs discussed previously. 
 Acquired from FDIC securities:
 Securities acquired from the FDIC consis
t of re-remic non-agency MBS, municipal 
securities and non-agency MBS. State and political subdivision
 securities and certain non-agency MBS acquired from the 
FDIC are valued in a manner similar to the approach described above for those asset classes. The re-remic non-agency MBS, 

which are categorized as Level 3, are valued based on broker deal
er quotes that reflected certain
 unobservable market inputs.  
 LHFS:
 Certain mortgage loans are originated to
 be sold to investors, which are carri
ed at fair value. The fair value is 
primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by
 similar types of loans. The changes in fair value of these 
assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subseque
nt to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing 
associated with the mortgage LHFS. 

 
Residential MSRs:
 Residential MSRs are valued using an OAS valuatio
n model to project cash flows over multiple interest 
rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rate
s. The model considers portfolio
 characteristics, contractually 
specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rate
s, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service 
and other economic factors. Fair value estim
ates and assumptions are compared to i
ndustry surveys, recent market activity, 
actual portfolio experience and, when available, other observable market data.  

 
Derivative assets and liabilities:
 The fair values of derivatives are determined based on quoted market prices and internal 
pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable
 data. The fair values of interest rate lock commitments, 
which are related to mortgage loan commit
ments and are categorized as Level 3, are 
based on quoted market prices adjusted 
for commitments that are not expected 
to fund and include the value attributable to the net servicing fees.  
 Private equity and similar investments:
 Private equity and similar investments are measured at fair value based on the 
investment™s net asset value. In many cases there are no 
observable market values for th
ese investments and therefore 
management must estimate the fair value based on a comparison of the operating performance of the company to multiples in 

the marketplace for similar entities. This analysis requires significant judgment, and 
actual values in a sale could differ 
materially from those estimated.  
 Short-term borrowings:
 Short-term borrowings represent debt securities sold 
short that are entered into as a hedging strategy 
for the purposes of supporting institutional and retail client trading activities.

ts and liabilities that are valued using Level 3 inputs:

   BB&T™s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 as of the end of a reporting period. Transfer
s in and out of Level 3 are shown in the preceding tables.  
 
BB&T™s private equity and similar invest
ments are primarily in SBIC qualifie
d funds, which focus on equity and 
subordinated debt investments in privately-held middle market companies. These investments generally are not redeemable 

and distributions are received as the under
lying assets of the funds liquidate. The 
timing of distributions, which are expected
 to occur on various dates through 2025, is uncertain and dependent on various events such as recapitalizations, refinance 

transactions and ownership changes among others. Excluding the investment of future funds, BB&T estimates these 

investments have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years; however, the timing and amount of 
distributions may vary significantly. As of December 31, 2014, restrictions on the ability to sell the investments include, but
 are not limited to, consent of a majority member or general partner approval for transfer of ownership. BB&T™s investments 
are spread over numerous privately-held middle market companie
s, and thus the sensitivity to a change in fair value for any 
single investment is limited. The significant unobservable inpu
ts for these investments are 
EBITDA multiples that ranged 
from 4x to 10x, with a weighted av
erage of 8x, at 
December 31, 2014.

   For financial instruments not recorded at fair value, estimates of
 fair value are based on relevant market data and information
 about the instrument and are based on the value of one trading unit without regard to any premium or discount that may result 

from concentrations of ownership, possible tax ramifications, estimated transaction costs that may result from bulk sales or 

the relationship between various instruments.  
 An active market does not exist for certain financial instrume
nts. Fair value estimates for these instruments are based on 
current economic conditions, currency and interest rate risk char
acteristics, loss experience and 
other factors. Many of these 
estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and cannot be determined with precision. Therefore, the 

fair value estimates in many instances cannot be substantiate
d by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, 
may not be realizable in a current sale of the instrument. In addition, changes in assumptions could significantly affect these
 fair value estimates. The following assumptions were used to
 estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
: For these short-term instruments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable 
estimate of fair values.  

 
HTM securities:
 The fair values of HTM securitie
s are based on a market approach using observable inputs such as 
benchmark yields and securities, TBA prices, reported trades, issuer spreads, current bids and offers, monthly payment 

information and collateral performance. 
 Loans receivable
: The fair values for loans are estimated using disc
ounted cash flow analyses, 
applying interest rates 
currently being offered for loans with similar terms and cr
edit quality, which are deemed to be indicative of orderly 
transactions in the current market. For commercial loans and 
leases, discount rates may be adjusted to address additional 
credit risk on lower risk grade instruments. For residential mortgage and other consumer loans, internal prepayment risk 

models are used to adjust contractual 
cash flows. Loans are aggregated into pools of similar terms and credit quality and 
discounted using a LIBOR based rate. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair values. 

 
FDIC loss share receivable and payable
: The fair values of the receivable and pa
yable are estimated using discounted cash 
flow analyses, applying a risk free interest rate that is adju
sted for the uncertainty in the 
timing and amount of the cash flo
ws. The expected cash flows to/fro
m the FDIC related to loans were estimated using the same assumptions that were used in 
determining the accounting values for the related loans. The ex
pected cash flows to/from the FD
IC related to securities are 
based upon the fair value of the related securities and the payment that would be required if the securities were sold for that
 amount. The loss share agreements are not transferrable and, accordingly, there is no market for the receivable or payable. 

 Deposit liabilities
: The fair values for demand deposits are equal to the amount payable on demand. Fair values for CDs are 
estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies 
current interest rates to aggregate expected maturities. BB&T 
has developed long-term relationships with its deposit custom
ers, commonly referred to as CDIs, that have not been 
considered in the determination of the deposit liabilities™ fair value. 
     
139 
 Short-term borrowings
: The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate their fair values. 
 Long-term debt
: The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument 
if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current 
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 
 
Contractual commitments
: The fair values of commitments are estimated 
using the fees charged to enter into similar 
agreements, taking into account the remain
ing terms of the agreements and the presen
t creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
The fair values of guarantees and letters
 of credit are estimated based on the co
unterparties™ creditwor
thiness and average 
default rates for loan products with simila
r risks. These respective fair value measur
ements are categorized
 within Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy. Retail lending commitments are assi
gned no fair value as BB&T typically has the ability to cancel 
such commitments by providing notice to the borrower.

 Assets and liabilities related to derivatives
 are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value
 of derivatives in a gain or loss position is included in other 
assets or liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance
 Sheets. Cash collateral posted for derivatives in a loss position is reported as restricted 
cash. Derivatives with dealer 
counterparties at both the bank and the parent company are go
verned by the terms of ISDA Master netting agreements and 
Credit Support Annexes. The ISDA Master agr
eements allow counterparties to offset trad
es in a gain against trades in a loss 
to determine net exposure and allows for the right of setoff in
 the event of either a default or an additional termination even
t. Credit Support Annexes govern the terms of daily collateral pos
ting practices. Collateral practices mitigate the potential loss
 impact to affected parties by requiring liquid collateral to be posted on a scheduled basis to secure the aggregate net 
unsecured exposure. In addition to collateral, the right of setoff
 allows counterparties to offset net derivative values with a
 defaulting party against certain other contr
actual receivables from or obligations du
e to the defaulting party in determining 
the net termination amount. No portion of the change in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges has been excluded 

from effectiveness testing. The ineffective por
tion was immaterial for all periods presented.

 Losses in value on fixed 
rate long-term debt, CDs, 
FHLB advances, loans and 
state and political 
subdivision securities due to 
changes in interest rates. 
 Risk associated with an asset or 
liability, including mortgage 
banking operations and MSRs, 
or for client needs. Includes 
exposure to changes in market 
rates and conditions subsequent 
to the interest rate lock and 
funding date for mortgage loans 
originated for sale. 
Risk management objective 
  Hedge the variability in the 
interest payments and 
receipts on future cash 
flows for forecasted 
transactions related to the 
first unhedged payments 
and receipts of variable 
interest. 
 Convert the fixed rate paid 
or received to a floating 
rate, primarily through the 
use of swaps. 
 For interest rate lock 
commitment derivatives and 
LHFS, use mortgage-based 
derivatives such as forward 
commitments and options to 
mitigate market risk. For MSRs, 
mitigate the income statement 
effect of changes in the fair 
value of the MSRs. 
Treatment for portion that is 
highly effective 
  Recognized in OCI until the 
related cash flows from the 
hedged item are recognized 
in earnings.  Recognized in current period income along with 
the corresponding changes 
in the fair value of the 
designated hedged item 
attributable to the risk being 
hedged. 
 Entire change in fair value 
recognized in current period 
income. 
Treatment for portion that is 
ineffective 
  Recognized in current period income. 
 Recognized in current period income. 
 Not applicable 
Treatment if hedge ceases to be 
highly effective or is terminated 
  Hedge is dedesignated. 
Effective changes in value 
that are recorded in OCI 
before dedesignation are 
amortized to yield over the 
period the forecasted 
hedged transactions impact 
earnings. 
 If hedged item remains 
outstanding, termination 
proceeds are included in 
cash flows from financing 
activities and effective 
changes in value are 
reflected as part of the 
carrying value of the 
financial instrument and 
amortized to earnings over 
its estimated remaining life.
 Not applicable 
Treatment if transaction is no 
longer probable of occurring 
during forecast period or within 
a short period thereafter 
  Hedge accounting is ceased 
and any gain or loss in OCI 
is reported in earnings 
immediately.

       87   Derivatives Credit Risk Œ Dealer Counterparties 
 Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts receiva
ble from a counterparty exceed those payable to the same 
counterparty. The risk of loss is addre
ssed by subjecting dealer counterparties to 
credit reviews and approvals similar to thos
e used in making loans or other extensions of credit and by requiring collateral. Dealer counterparties operate under agreements 
to provide cash and/or liquid collateral when uns
ecured loss positions exceed negotiated limits.  
 
Derivative contracts with dealer 
counterparties settle on a monthly, quarterly 
or semiannual basis, wi
th daily movement of 
collateral between counterparties required within estab
lished netting agreements. BB&T only transacts with dealer 
counterparties that are nati
onal market makers with strong credit standings.  
 Derivatives Credit Risk Œ Central Clearing Parties 
 Certain derivatives are cleared through central clearing parties 
that require initial margin collateral, as well as collateral 
for 
trades in a net loss position. Initial margin collateral requirements are established by central clearing parties on varying ba
ses, 
with such amounts generally designed to offset the risk of n
on-payment. Initial margin is gene
rally calculated by applying the 
maximum loss experienced in value over a 
specified time horizon to the portfolio of
 existing trades. The central clearing 
party used for TBA transactions does not post variation margin to the bank.

   NOTE 21. Operating Segments 
  BB&T's operations are divided into six reportable business segments that have been identified based on BB&T™s 
organizational structure. The segments require unique technology and marketing strategies and offer different products and 

services through a number of distinct branded LOBs. While BB&T is managed as an integrated organization, individual 
executive managers are held accountable for th
e operations of these business segments. 
 BB&T emphasizes revenue growth by focusing on client service, sales effectiveness and relationship management along with 
an organizational focus on referring clients between LOBs. The business objective is to provide BB&T™s entire suite of 
products to our clients with the end goa
l of providing ou
r clients the best financial experience in the marketplace. The 
segment results contained herein are presented based on internal management accounting policies that were designed to 
support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, th
ere is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for 
management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The performan
ce of the segments is not comparable with BB&T™s 
consolidated results or with similar information presented by 
any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the 
interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if 
they operated as independent entities. 
 The management accounting process uses various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the 

operating segments. To determine financial performance for each segment, BB&T allocates capital, funding charges and 
credits, an allocated provision for loan and lease losses, certain noninterest expe
nses and income tax provisions to each 
segment, as applicable. To promote revenue growth, certain re
venues are reflected in noninterest income in the individual 
segment results and also allocated to Community Banking and 
Financial Services. These allocated revenues are reflected in 
intersegment net referral fees and eliminated in Other, Trea
sury and Corporate. Additionally certain client groups of 
Community Banking have also been identified as clients of other LOBs within the business segments. Periodically, existing 
clients within the Community Banking segment may be identified and assigned as wealth and private banking clients. At the 
time of identification, these clients™ loan and deposit balances 
are reported in the Financial Se
rvices segment from the time o
f assignment forward. The net interest income
 and associated net FTP associated with 
these customers™ loans and deposits is 
accounted for in Community Banking in the 
respective line categories of 
net interest income (expense) and net intersegment 
interest income (expense). For the Commercial Finance LOB an
d the Wealth Division, NIM and net intersegment interest 
income have been combined in the net intersegment interest income (expense) line with an appropriate offsetting amount to 
the Other, Treasury and Corporate line item to ensure conso
lidated totals reflect the Company™s total NIM for loans and 
deposits. Allocation methodologies are subject to periodic ad
justment as the internal management accounting system is 
revised and business or product lines with
in the segments change. Also, because th
e development and application of these 
methodologies is a dynamic process, the financial results presented may be periodically revised. 
 BB&T utilizes an FTP system to eliminate the effect of interest 
rate risk from the segments™ net interest income because such 
risk is centrally managed within the Treasury function. The FT
P system credits or charges the segments with the economic 
value or cost of the funds the segments 
create or use. The net FTP credit or char
ge, which includes intercompany interest 
income and expense, is reflected as net intersegment income (expense) in the accompanying tables. 
    
145 
  The allocated provision for loan
 and lease losses is also allocated to the relevant segments based on management™s 
assessment of the segments™ credit risks. The allocated provision 
is designed to achieve a high degree of correlation between 
the loan loss experience and the GAAP ba
sis provision at the segment level, while at the same time providing management 
with a measure of operating performance that gives appropriate 
consideration to the risks inherent in each of the Company™s 
operating segments. Any over or under allocated provision for 
loan and lease losses is reflected in Other, Treasury and 
Corporate to arrive at consolidated results. 

 BB&T allocates expenses to the reportable segments based on various methodologies, including volume and amount of loans 

and deposits and the number of full-time equivalent employees
. Allocation systems are refined from time to time along with 
further identification of certain cost pools. These cost pools and refinements are implemented to provide for improved 

managerial reporting of cost to the appropriate business segments. A portion of corporate overhead expense is not allocated, 
but is retained in corporate accounts and reflected as Other,
 Treasury and Corporate in the accompanying tables. The majority 
of depreciation expense is recorded in support units and allocat
ed to the segments as part of allocated corporate expense. 
Income taxes are allocated to the various segments based on ta
xable income and statutory rate
s applicable to the segment. 
 Community Banking 
  Community Banking serves individual and business clients by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other 
financial services. Community Banking is primarily responsible 
for serving client relationships
 and, therefore, is credited 
with certain revenue from the Residential Mortgage Banking, 
Financial Services, Insurance Se
rvices, Specialized Lending, 
and other segments, which is reflected in net referral fees. 

 Residential Mortgage Banking  
 Residential Mortgage Banking retains and services mortgage loans originated by Community Banking as well as those 
purchased from various correspondent originators. Mortgage loan products include fixed and adjustable rate government and 
conventional loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or
 refinancing residential properties. Substantially all of the 
properties are owner occupied. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights to loans sold. Residential Mortgage Banking 
earns interest on loans held in the warehouse and portfolio, ea
rns fee income from the origination and servicing of mortgage 
loans and recognizes gains or losses from the sale of mortgage loans. 

 Dealer Financial Services  
 Dealer Financial Services originates loans 
to consumers on a prime and nonprime basis for the purchase of automobiles. Such 
loans are originated on an in
direct basis through approved franchised and independent automobile dealers throughout the 
BB&T market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Co
rporation. This segment also originates loans for the 
purchase of boats and recreational vehicles originated throug
h dealers in BB&T™s market area. In addition, financing and 
servicing to dealers for their inventories is provided through
 a joint relationship between Dealer Financial Services and 
Community Banking. 
 Specialized Lending  
 BB&T's Specialized Lending consists of LO
Bs and subsidiaries that provide specia
lty finance products to consumers and 
businesses. The LOBs include Commercial Finance and Governmental Finance. Commercial Finance structures and manages 
asset-based working capital financing, supply chain financing,
 export-import finance, accounts receivable management and 
credit enhancement. Commercial Finance also contains the Mortgage Warehouse Lending business, which provides short-
term lending solutions to finance first-lien residential mortgage LHFS by independent mortgage companies. Governmental 
Finance provides tax-exempt financing to meet the capital project needs of local governments. Operating subsidiaries include 

BB&T Equipment Finance, which provides equipment leasing largely within BB&T™s banking footprint; Sheffield Financial, 
a dealer-based financer of equipment fo
r both small businesses and consumers; Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, 
which includes AFCO and CAFO, insurance premium finance LOBs
 that provide funding to businesses in the United States 

and Canada and to consumers in certain markets within BB&T™s banking footprint; and Grandbridge, a full-service 
commercial mortgage banking lender providing loans on a national basis. Lendmark Financial Services, a direct consumer 

finance lending company, was sold during the fourth quarter of 2013, resulting in the sale of $500 million of loans and the 
transfer of $230 million of loans to Residential Mortgage Banking. Branch Bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and 
outside BB&T™s primary geographic market area are served
 by these LOBs. The Commun
ity Banking segment receives 
credit for referrals to these LOBs with th
e corresponding charge retained as part 
of Other, Treasury and Corporate in the 
accompanying tables. 

     
146 
 Insurance Services  
 BB&T's insurance agency / brokerage networ
k is the sixth largest in the world. Insurance Services provides property and 
casualty, employee benefits and life insurance to businesses and individuals. It also provides small business and corporate 
services, such as workers compensation and professional liability
, as well as surety coverage and title insurance. In addition,
 Insurance Services underwrites a limited amount of property and casualty coverage. Community Banking and Financial 
Services receive credit for insurance commissions on referred 
accounts, with the correspond
ing charge retained in the 
corporate office, which is reflected 
as part of Other, Treasury and Co
rporate in the accompanying tables. 
 Financial Services  
 Financial Services provides personal trust administration, esta
te planning, investment counseling, wealth management, asset 
management, corporate retirement services, 
corporate banking and corporate trust services. Financial Services also offers 
clients investment alternatives, including discount brokerage se
rvices, equities, fixed-rate and variable-rate annuities, mutua
l funds and governmental and municipal bonds through BB&T Investment Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Branch Bank. 
 Financial Services includes BB&T Securities, a full-service brok
erage and investment banking firm that provides services in 

retail brokerage, equity and debt underwriting, investment advi
ce, corporate finance and equity research and facilitates the 
origination, trading and distribution of fixed-income securities and equity products in both the public and private capital 

markets. BB&T Securities also has a public finance department th
at provides investment banking services, financial advisory 
services and municipal bond financing to a variety of regional taxable and tax-exempt issuers. 
 Financial Services includes a group of
 BB&T-sponsored private equity and mezzanine investment funds that invests in 
privately owned middle-market operating companies to facilita
te growth or ownership transition while leveraging the 
Community Banking network for referrals and other bank services. Financial Services also includes the Corporate Banking 

Division that originates and services large corporate relationships, syndicated lending relationships and client derivatives. 

Community Banking receives an interoffice cred
it for referral fees, with the corresponding
 charge reflected as part of Other, 
Treasury and Corporate in the acco
mpanying tables. Also captured 
within the net intersegment interest income for Financial 
Services is the NIM for the loans and deposits assigned to the Wealth Management Division that are housed in the 

Community Bank. 
 Other, Treasury and Corporate  
 Other, Treasury and Corporate is the combination of the Other se
gment that represents operating entities that do not meet the 
quantitative or qualitative thresholds for disclosure; BB&T™s Treas
ury function, which is responsible for the management of 
the securities portfolios, overall balance sheet funding and liqui
dity, and overall management of interest rate risk; the 
corporate support functions that have not been allocated to the 
business segments; merger-related
 charges or credits that are 
incurred as part of the acquisition and conversion of acquired 
entities; nonrecurring charges that are considered to be unusual
 in nature or infrequent and not reflective of the normal opera
tions of the segments; and intercompany eliminations including 
intersegment net referral fees and net intersegment interest income (expense). 
 The loan portfolio acquired in the Colonial acquisition is managed outside of the Community Banking segment. The assets 
and related interest income from this loan portfolio have an 
expected finite business life an
d are therefore included in the 
Other, Treasury and Corporate segment. The investment balances and results related to affordable housing investments are 
also included in this segment. Results for BankAtlantic were 
included in the Other, Treasury and Corporate segment until the 
system conversion in October 2
012. Historically, performance results of bank
 acquisitions prior to system conversion are 
reported in this segment and on a post-conversion date are reported in the Community Banking segment. 

 Segment Asset Transfer 
 During January 2014, approximately $8.3 billion of home equity loans and lines were transferred from Community Banking 
to Residential Mortgage Banking based on a change in how
 these loans will be managed as a result of new qualified 
mortgage regulations. The following table has been retrospectively adjusted for the loan transfer.

Forward-Looking Statements
This 2014 Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements as de˜ned in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address 
issues that involve signi˜cant risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions made by management. Actual results may differ materially from current projections. 
Please refer to BB&T™s ˜lings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a summary of important factors that may affect BB&T™s forward-looking statements. BB&T 
undertakes no obligation to revise these statements following the date of this Annual Report.
About the Report
This 2014 Annual Report contains ˜nancial information and performance measures 
determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (ﬁGAAPﬂ). BB&T™s management 
uses these measures to evaluate the underlying performance and efficiency 
 of BB&T™s operations. Management believes that non-GAAP measures provide 
 a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results 
with prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of signi˜cant gains and 
charges in the current period. The company believes that a meaningful analysis of 

its ˜nancial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that 
performance. BB&T™s management believes investors may use these non-GAAP 
˜nancial measures to analyze ˜nancial performance without the impact of unusual 
items that may obscure trends in the company™s underlying performance. These 

disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for ˜nancial measures determined 

in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP 
performance measures that may be presented by other companies. The Tier 1 
common equity ratio is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to the Annual Report on 
 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and BBT.com for appropriate 
non-GAAP disclosures and reconciliations.
