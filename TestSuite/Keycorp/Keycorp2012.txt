To our fellow shareholders:
I am pleased to report that 2012 was a signi˜cant year for Key. Our balance 
sheet continued to strengthen and grow, credit quality measures improved to 
pre-˜nancial crisis levels and we delivered on our strategic and ˜nancial goals. 
In addition, and perhaps most noteworthy, we accomplished all of this while 

navigating through the challenges of a weak economy and a prolonged low 
 rate environment, as well as ongoing regulatory changes.
Our relationship-based strategy, unique business model and geographic 
footprint allow us to make progress despite these headwinds. In 2012, we 

continued to leverage and build upon the alignment of our franchise across 

business lines, sharpening our targeted focus on speci˜c client segments 
and industries while investing to enhance our capabilities. As a result, we 
are a stronger, more focused company, building momentum and delivering 

sustainable pro˜tability as we pursue our long-term growth strategy.
Full-year net income from continuing operations was $827 million, or $.88 per 
diluted share, compared with $857 million, or $.92 per diluted share, in 2011. 

Our results in 2012 were impacted by a lower level of reserve release as credit 
costs normalized, as well as costs related to our strategic acquisitions and 
ef˜ciency initiative.
A year of accomplishment 
Strong revenue growth.
 Revenue was up 4% for 2012 compared to the prior year 
as loans grew, net interest margin improved and fees increased. In the fourth 
quarter, Key grew revenue by 10%, and contrary to industry trends, expanded 

net interest margin by 24 basis points from the same period one year ago. 
Robust loan growth.
 Key™s strong loan growth re˚ects the strength of our 

relationship strategy. Peer-leading growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) 

loans was once again the primary driver of our overall loan portfolio, as 
businesses increasingly turned to Key to meet their borrowing needs.
The C&I portfolio has been a consistent bright spot for Key, growing 21% 
 last year. Consumer loans also grew in 2012, driven by rising home equity 
balances and increased loan and credit card balances from the acquisitions 
 of our Key-branded credit card portfolio and branches in Buffalo and 

Rochester, New York.
Positive fee income results.
 Fees were another positive story for Key in 2012. 
The Corporate Bank had a great year, increasing fees year-over-year by 

emphasizing our relationship-based strategy and pursuing targeted clients 
and industries with speci˜c capabilities and expertise. Our Commercial Real 
Estate Mortgage Banking group had its best year ever due to increasing loan 

originations and fee income. It was also a record year for KeyBanc Capital 

Markets, with strong fee growth from loan syndications, investment banking 
and debt placement.
Strengthened credit quality.
 Net charge-offs declined by 36% in 2012 
 compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were 
 $58 million or .44% of average loans, the best level since third quarter 
 2007. This is signi˜cant as we are now within our targeted range for 
 net charge-offs, and we will continue to be disciplined in our lending.

32Disciplined capital management.
 In 2012, Key maintained its peer-leading 
capital position, ending the year with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.4% 
and returning 50% of net income to shareholders through the repurchase 
of common stock and an increase in our dividend. We also used our capital 
to acquire market share in Western New York and to develop new revenue 

streams in credit card and other payment products. 
Focused Forward
As we™ve shown on the cover, the theme of this year™s annual review is 
ﬁFocused Forward,ﬂ which describes where Key is today Œ building on our 

strong foundation and core values to create a top-tier organization that is 
 best equipped to serve our clients, communities and shareholders.
We have realigned ourselves around our core competencies and are now 
on our journey forward, focusing on strategy execution, growth, ef˜ciency, 

managing our capital and living our values through corporate responsibility.
Focused on Execution. 
Focused execution is an important part of our culture 
at Key and is fueled by the dedication, discipline and commitment of our 

15,000 colleagues. This is exempli˜ed by our approach to managing risk, 

capital and expenses. We are also client-focused, and we strive to consistently 

set the industry standard for client service. Our teams are building momentum 
by working together across business lines to identify, share and convert new 
client opportunities.
Our operating gains in 2012 are attributable to the differentiated strategy in our 
Community and Corporate Banks that truly distinguishes us in the marketplace. 
Our relationship-based model is what drives Key™s value for our clients. And 
now, thanks to the remarkable talents of our employees, our relationship 

approach is who we are, hard-wired in our DNA, and integral to our operating 

culture. We believe in it; we count on it; we deliver it. 
We designed our relationship model to further set Key apart from competitors. 
First and foremost, our employees are central to our distinctive approach. 

Each day they identify client needs and then work collaboratively across Key™s 
business lines to deliver to clients an array of ˜nancial products that are 
 truly differentiated. This powerful combination of quality service and products 

produces the kind of readily discernible value that yields long-lasting, multi-
service and high-margin relationships.
As part of our strategy execution, we are continually evaluating our businesses and 
˜nding ways to make them better. With a mindset of actively managing for growth, 

we have invested in, reinvented, exited and entered new businesses to strengthen 

our company going forward. For example, we have invested in payments, 
online and mobile capabilities and have rede˜ned both our agreement for Key 
Merchant Services and our commercial real estate platform. We also announced 

the sale of Victory Capital Management while re-entering the credit card 

business and acquiring branches in Western New York to gain market share.   
To measure our success, and to help spur the drive for continuous 
improvement, we rely on clients to tell us how we are doing. Key™s customer 

satisfaction levels continue to exceed industry averages according to the 

American Customer Satisfaction Index. This is consistent with our internal 
satisfaction surveys indicating that clients are increasingly satis˜ed with our 
branch employees and with external recognition we have received for business

banking, treasury management and online banking. At the same time, Key 
experienced a signi˜cant improvement in employee engagement when most 

other companies that conducted the same survey saw a decline.
Focused on Growth.
 The real proof of our relationship model™s success comes 
from our business growth. On that important metric, we are increasing our 

market share by expanding relationships with existing clients and acquiring new 

clients. Looking ahead, we are con˜dent that our dynamic approach will result 
in further gains.
We have also continued to invest in our businesses. We strengthened our share 
in targeted Western New York markets by acquiring and successfully integrating 

37 new branches. As part of our payments strategy, we re-entered the credit 

card business through the purchase of our Key-branded card portfolio made 
up of about 400,000 current and former clients. In addition, we entered into an 
exclusive agreement that allows us to better integrate and expand merchant 

processing services into our overall payment solutions offering. 
Focused on Ef˜ciency.
 In 2012, we continued to address the realities of the 
present environment through a series of broad, comprehensive and rigorous 
efforts to improve ef˜ciency across our entire organization. This puts us on a 

path for delivering results, with a long-term plan for greater revenue growth, 

ef˜ciency, productivity and value for our shareholders.
We made progress on our ef˜ciency goals with a culture of continuous 
improvement designed to improve our operating leverage by reducing and creating 
a more variable cost structure, while at the same time moving to accelerate our 

revenue growth. Through focused execution, Key achieved its interim 2012 goal 

and produced a run rate annualized savings of approximately $60 million. We 
are on track to achieve our goal of capturing $200 million in cumulative annual 
expense reductions by December 2013 and remain committed to achieving an 

ef˜ciency ratio in the range of 60% to 65% by the ˜rst quarter of 2014.
We will not stop there Œ continuous improvement is ˜rmly embedded within 
 our culture as we evaluate all meaningful ideas to lower our expenses while 
pursuing our growth strategy. 
We believe that our long-term success rests on the ability to continue 
 to identify ways to improve our cost structure, to generate revenue through 
 our relationship-based strategy and to meet our commitments to our clients, 
 to our shareholders and to each other.
Focused on Capital Management.
 Our capital management strategy 
 remains centered around value creation. In March 2013, we announced that 
our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program 
of up to $426 million and will consider an increase in its quarterly common 
stock dividend in the second quarter of this year. Further, as we announced in 

February 2013, Key intends to seek regulatory approval to use the gain from 

the sale of Victory Capital Management to repurchase additional shares of 
common stock.
With prudent capital management a consistent priority for Key, we are 
committed to maintaining our strong capital position, leveraging opportunities 

for deployment that create value for shareholders, and meeting the new 
 Basel III global capital requirements.
Focus on Corporate Responsibility.
 At Key, our purpose is to help our clients 
and communities thrive, which is central to our character and values. This 
means participating in the growth and revitalization of our communities through 

lending, investing, grants, volunteerism and environmental stewardship with fair 
and equitable banking as well as a promise to improve the ˜nancial literacy of 
our clients. It involves creating not only a diverse and inclusive workforce, but 

also a diverse and inclusive business environment that develops and delivers 

the right products and services to ful˜ll a broad spectrum of client needs. 
We have advanced our work with underserved individuals and families, 
maintaining our focus on community development. We have also been 
recognized as a leader in providing fair and equitable products to our clients, 
and we place a strong emphasis on promoting sustainability, diversity and 

inclusion, within both Key and the markets and communities we proudly serve. 

When the communities in which we do business are healthy, we all succeed.

89Board of Directors
One of the long-standing strengths of our company is the quality and diversity 
of our Board of Directors and our strong corporate governance practices. Our 

Board includes six sitting or retired CEOs, as well as other individuals with 

extensive ˜nancial services and risk management backgrounds. Our Board 

continuously evaluates management, our strategy and plans to ensure we 
execute in a manner consistent with maximizing shareholder value.
We want to recognize the outstanding contribution of two Directors who will 
 be retiring this year. Bill R. Sanford, who has been a Key Director since 1999, 
will not be standing for re-election. He has been a strong advocate for our 
client-focused strategy and has provided sound guidance to us as we seek 
 to meet heightened regulatory expectations.
Tom Stevens, who has served as KeyCorp™s Vice Chairman and Chief 
Administrative Of˜cer since 2001, announced his retirement, effective this 

year. Tom™s experience, character and integrity are aptly re˚ected in his many 
contributions to Key and to our community. 
Looking forward
In 2013, I expect only modest improvement in the operating environment for 
the banking industry. The nation is slowly recovering from a prolonged and 
debilitating recession. I believe that our economy and our industry continue 
 to improve, and I am optimistic about Key™s potential. Our employees continue 
 to be a true strategic advantage. As our relationship-based model gains 

traction in our markets, clients are coming to us, staying with us, and talking 
 to others about us.

8As we Focus Forward in 2013: We intend to grow revenue, improve ef˜ciency 
and effectively manage Key™s strong capital. To reach these objectives, we 

will maximize the power of our relationship strategy; maintain a moderate 
risk pro˜le in our loan portfolio; invest opportunistically when it will accelerate 
revenue growth; further improve our cost structure; and leverage capital to 

maximize shareholder value.
In May, I will mark the completion of my second year as your Chief Executive. 
I am continually energized and inspired by the example set by our talented 
and diverse team. We have never been more committed to our goals Œ more 

Focused Forward Œ than we are now, at this exciting and promising juncture 
 in Key™s journey. 
Much work remains to be done. Each and every day, I see signi˜cant progress 
toward our goals and validation that our strategies are sound. Our balance 
sheet will continue to strengthen and grow, our credit quality will remain strong 

and we will become more ef˜cient. We have created a culture that is driven by 

collaboration across business lines, service quality, corporate responsibility 

and a targeted focus on clients and industries. As a result, I am con˜dent in 
 the future that will unfold Œ for our clients, our employees, our communities, 

and you, our shareholders.
Sincerely,
Beth E. Mooney
 Chairman and Chief Executive Of˜cer

Being Focused Forward requires directing our time, talent and resources 
to strengthen our business, grow revenue and improve pro˜tability through 

enhanced ef˜ciency and effectiveness. This includes focusing on organic growth 
through acquiring and expanding client relationships as well as identifying 
speci˜c opportunities to invest in capabilities that strengthen our product offering 

and franchise. Investing in our payment, channel and technology capabilities 

accelerates our momentum and enhances our growth trajectory.
Organic growth
Key™s differentiated business model enables us to execute on our strategic 
priority of organic growth by pairing relationship focus and local delivery with 

distinctive capabilities and expertise. The breadth of our offering, delivered 
seamlessly to the client through our collaborative approach, is a signi˜cant 
competitive advantage. Over the last few years, we have continued to invest 

in our business model, which is centered on targeted client segments, core 

competencies, and our commitment to leverage alignment across the entire 
organization for enhanced client impact. 
As a result, we have accelerated our revenue growth and strengthened our risk 
pro˜le. Loan balances and core deposits have grown consistently, demonstrating 

the impact we are having with our clients by focusing on opportunities where 

our relationship strategy and distinctive capabilities resonate. 
A clear example of this can be seen in our Corporate Bank. Four years ago, 
 we had $29 billion of loans across various industries and geographies. Many 
 of the clients were more transactional in nature and were not looking for a 
valued advisor. 
Since then, we have become more focused with six targeted industry verticals 

that align with our core competencies. The result has been a smaller, but much 

more ef˜cient and pro˜table, Corporate Bank balance sheet. 
Payments
Our payment products provide another growth opportunity for Key in that 
they are strong relationship expanders and great sources of fee income. Our 

clients rely heavily on payment products in their daily operations, from remitting 

to processing and receiving. That creates importance and value around 
robust and reliable offerings. Aligned with our client focus, we are driving our 
payments business through numerous enhancements for both consumer and 

commercial clients, allowing them to ful˜ll their payments-related needs in 
 focused on growth

an ef˜cient, comprehensive and effective manner. These changes are 
consistent with our strategy, enable us to acquire and expand relationships, 

and allow us to deliver more value in a cost-effective way by providing bundled 
solutions across all of Key™s business segments. 
In 2012, we re-entered the credit card business with the acquisition of a 
 $725 million Key-branded credit card portfolio comprising current and former 
Key clients who have signi˜cant, broader relationships at the bank, including 
approximately $10 billion in loans and $6 billion in deposits. We also began 
self-issuance of credit cards. These actions are part of Key™s strategy to 

mitigate the economic impact of regulatory changes, while also diversifying 
 our revenue streams. 
Overall, our re-entrance into the credit card business provides meaningful 

opportunities for future growth and the early results have exceeded our 

expectations. Production of new accounts is up sharply and the penetration 
 of our existing client base is increasing. 
Further, Key expects to launch enhanced commercial card capabilities 
 in 2013, providing our clients with more comprehensive and integrated 
commercial payments solutions. Our strengthened payments platform 
 presents new product and market opportunities, which will drive revenue 
 and strengthen relationships.
Key also entered into a new merchant services arrangement, which is more 
direct and ef˜cient as it provides us with the opportunity to more fully integrate 

merchant processing services into our overall payments solutions for commercial 
clients. With direct responsibility for new business originations, as well as 
the merchant services sales force, Key will be better positioned to impact a 

client™s entire relationship, earn more attractive economics from the relationship 

and garner insights that drive optimal client solutions. We have the ability to 

more effectively attract and retain merchant clients while also realizing an 
approximate 50% reduction in processing costs. 
Additionally, Key™s ATM and debit branding and processing agreement, 
expected to be implemented in the ˜rst half of 2013, positions Key to meet 
its consumer clients™ payments needs with industry-leading debit payment 
solutions and processing capabilities. The agreement signi˜cantly improves 

overall operating ef˜ciency and better aligns Key™s expense base with the 

current environment. 
Finally, in 2012, Key launched a comprehensive relationship rewards program 
with an expanded offering for clients. We are now able to reward clients 
for a more extensive relationship with the bank, which is consistent with 
relationships being at the center of our value proposition.

and commercial clients both continue to value our branches, which provide an 

important face-to-face contact point. At the same time, our online and mobile 

channels are becoming increasingly popular and complementary to the 
 branch experience. We have seen both online and mobile banking penetration 

continue to climb.
We have also been rationalizing our branch network to improve ef˜ciency 
and effectiveness. In 2012, we acquired 37 Western New York branches to 
meaningfully strengthen our share in Buffalo and Rochester. The acquisition 
serves as a good example of how we are selectively investing in markets 
 and industry segments where there is opportunity to serve targeted client 

segments and gain share. Additionally, aligned with our efforts to improve 

ef˜ciency, in 2012 we announced that we were targeting the consolidation 
 of approximately 5% of our franchise by year-end 2013. We consolidated 
 19 branches in 2012 and have an additional 50 planned for 2013. We are being 

disciplined and diligent with our branch consolidation plans, identifying areas 

where client demand no longer supports a branch and redeploying those 

resources to more productive areas. 
Technology
Banking is becoming more technology-driven every day. At Key, we are 
advancing our technological capabilities while also driving enhancements that 
promote both ef˜ciency and effectiveness. This includes investing in online and 
mobile capabilities to meet evolving client preferences. In 2012, we delivered 

new mobile apps, continued to enhance our website and promoted our 

expanded bill pay capabilities. 
We are also improving our sales and service tools while maintaining our 
 image-enabled infrastructure. Doing so aids productivity, ful˜lls client 

preferences and improves the ef˜ciency of our workforce. Finally, we are 

developing solutions to comply with new industry-wide regulations. 
As we look ahead, we remain diligently focused on identifying and executing 
opportunities to grow our businesses. We are leveraging and building upon 
our success in growing organically, both by expanding and acquiring client 

relationships. Through investments of time and capital, we are driving our 

business forward and positioning ourselves for growth in the years to come.

At Key, our purpose is to help our clients and communities thrive. Together, 
we are dedicated to helping build stronger communities and to improving the 

lives of the people we call neighbors, in the places we call home. It™s all part 
of our promise to put people ˜rst. We are strong believers in the power of 
corporate responsibility, which is how we seek to ful˜ll our purpose and de˜ne 

our character.
We are committed to corporate responsibility, recognizing that we are 
responsible not only for our company, but also for our clients and the 
communities we serve. That is why we continue to strive to operate in a way 

which re˚ects our core values. By understanding and addressing the needs 
 of our communities, we are able to leverage our strengths and assets to make 
 a sustainable and measurable difference. 
We invest time, talent, energy and resources in a manner consistent with 
 our strategy to improve and best serve our communities and clients. This 

includes promoting not only an inclusive workplace but an inclusive business 

environment as well. Additionally, we strive to be good stewards of our 

environment, working with urgency and discipline to sustain and grow for 
 the long term while also directing resources to provide future generations 
 with a healthy environment and stable economic and social conditions.
Our commitment to corporate responsibility is evident throughout our 
company as we direct our resources toward community and philanthropic 
investments, diversity, inclusion and sustainability. We are proud of our many 
accomplishments and remain encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead.
Community and philanthropic investments
We take a broad and integrated approach to investing in low- to moderate-income 
communities, nonpro˜t agencies, health and human service providers, culture and 

the humanities, and community-based projects and programs. This enables 
our company to create greater economic independence, encourages employee 
volunteerism and engagement, and stabilizes families and neighborhoods.
At the close of 2012, Key had more than $2.1 billion in loans and investments 
supporting affordable housing and commercial projects in low- to moderate-
income communities. In 2012 alone, we originated more than $900 million in 
loans and investments for nearly 150 projects that supported housing for the 

homeless and citizens with special needs, as well as commercial projects that 

brought jobs and businesses to our low- to moderate-income communities.

2012 KeyCorp Annual Review
1617Together, KeyBank Foundation and our employees made over 5,200 grants 
 and contributions exceeding $18 million for nonpro˜t agencies in 2012 

supporting targeted strategies around economic self-suf˜ciency, workforce 
development, and diversity and inclusion. Our employees volunteered a total 
 of 81,000 hours in the communities where we work and live, including more 
than 500 employee volunteers providing ˜nancial education classes to 
 5,400 clients and non-clients alike. 
Our Neighbors Make The Difference
® program
, where our employees 
volunteered their time for 1,000 community service projects nationwide, and 
 our Super Refund Saturday program, where employee volunteers prepared 
more than 1,600 tax returns, which generated approximately $3.6 million 
in federal tax refunds to local communities, are two nationally recognized 

programs highlighting the hard work of our employees.
Diversity and inclusion 
Diversity and inclusion are strategic priorities for Key. We believe that a 
diverse and inclusive workforce and business environment enhance the client 

experience and shareholder value.
Since 2008 we have spent $585 million with diverse suppliers, demonstrating 
 the importance of economic inclusion for our company. In 2012 alone, the 
amount we spent with diverse suppliers was nearly twice the national average.
Sustainability 
Key™s sustainability program is another way in which we continue to make a 
difference, with signi˜cant progress made over the past year. We have made 
a strong commitment to being a leader in green building practices and energy 

management. In 2012, Key achieved approximately $1.6 million in energy cost 

savings, with consumption down 8% from the previous year.  
ﬁCorporate responsibility is central to our values. It is who we are and who we will continue to be.ﬂ
Bruce Murphy
For the ˜rst time in Key™s history, we responded to the Carbon Disclosure 

Project in May of 2012, and received a score of 89 out of 100 for Disclosure, 

and a Performance score of ﬁB.ﬂ In every category, Key scored higher than 
 the average among the 52 ˜nancial companies that responded.  
At Key, we are committed to helping our clients and communities thrive. 
Corporate responsibility is a proud part of who we are and who we will 
continue to be going forward. It is central to our character and the values of 

our company. We strive to positively impact the communities in which we live 

and work, and we take pride in creating a diverse, inclusive and sustainable 

workplace. By working together and championing economic vitality in our 
communities, we can all achieve signi˜cant results.
