tum3To our fellow  
shareholders:
2011 was a signiﬁcant year 
for Key. We continued to 

strengthen our balance 

sheet and show impressive 

improvement in our credit 

quality. We reached an 

“inﬂection point” in growing 

our loan portfolio. We 

strengthened the alignment 

of our franchise across 

business lines to serve 

our clients, focusing on 

speciﬁc client segments 

and industries. And, 

perhaps most noteworthy, 

we accomplished all of this 

while navigating through the 

ongoing challenges of the 

economy and changes in 

the regulatory environment. 

As a result, we have 

emerged as a stronger, 

more focused company, 

positioned to build 

momentum and deliver 

sustainable proﬁtability as 

we pursue our long-term 
growth strategy.
Our focused actions 
delivered improved results  

in 2011. Full-year net  

income from continuing 

operations was $857 million, 

or $0.92 per common share, 

compared with $413 million, 

or $0.47 per common share, 

in 2010. This performance 

reﬂects our successes in 

improving our risk proﬁle, 

strengthening our credit 

culture, driving loan growth, 

controlling expenses and 

executing our relationship-

oriented business strategy.
With a clear focus on 
execution, customer service 

and proﬁtable growth, we 

are now in an excellent 

position to demonstrate 

what makes Key truly 

different for our customers 

and shareholders. Our 

business model is unique 

because it allows us to 

provide superior service 

through the alignment and 

integration of our Corporate 

and Community banks. That 

difference is at the heart  

of our strategy, which is to 

grow by building enduring 

relationships through 

client-focused solutions  

and extraordinary service. 
letter to shareholders
As shown on the cover, the 

theme of this annual report 

is “Strong, Focused, and 

Building Momentum.” Those 

words accurately describe 

where Key is today – poised 

for a bright future. Here’s 

why we feel this way: 
Strong. First and foremost, 
our ﬁnancial position is 

strong and getting stronger, 

thanks to the diligent efforts 

of our entire team to 

improve our balance sheet, 

strengthen our capital and 

reduce the risk in our 

portfolio. We are committed 

to maintaining a strong 

capital position and 

meeting the new Basel III 

global capital requirements. 

We also gain strength  

from our performance-

oriented culture, which 

drives accountability within 

our organization and  

keeps us focused on our 

strategic goals.
We have emerged as a 
stronger, more focused 
company, positioned to 
build momentum and deliver 
sustainable proﬁtability.

Chairman and  
Chief Executive

5Focused.
 Focused 
execution is the way of life 

throughout our organization, 

fueled by people who 

are disciplined in their 

thoughts and actions. 

This is exempliﬁed by our 

approach to managing risk, 

capital and expenses. We 

are also client-focused, and 

we strive to consistently 

set the industry standard 

for customer service. 

Our teams are focused 

on building momentum 

by working together 

across business lines to 

identify, share and convert 

opportunities.
Building momentum.
 Our 
momentum will continue to 

build as our relationship-

oriented business model 

generates results. This 

model is distinctive in the 

marketplace and positions 

us for long-term, balanced 

growth. Signiﬁcantly, our 

loan balances reached an 

inﬂection point in 2011, with 
commercial, ﬁnancial, and 
agricultural loans increasing 
for three consecutive 

quarters. This supports our 
belief that our repositioning 
is mostly complete, our 
momentum is building, and 

that we will continue to 
show sustainable growth 
going forward.
A year of  
accomplishment
Building on our strong 
balance sheet and improved 

ﬁnancial performance, our 

accomplishments in 2011 

will serve as the foundation 

for our ability to generate 

sustained growth.
Reﬂecting our strengthened 
capital position, our Tier 1 

common equity ratio 

improved to 11.26% at 

year-end, placing us in the 

top quartile of our peer 

group. Indicative of the 

progress that we have 

made, in March 2011 we 

repurchased the preferred 

shares held as a result of 

Key’s participation in the 

U.S. Treasury’s TARP 

Capital Purchase Program.
Our efforts over the past 
several years toward 

early recognition and 

resolution of our problem 

credits have substantially 

improved our risk proﬁle 

and strengthened our credit 

quality. Key’s net charge-off 

ratio improved to below 1% 

for the ﬁrst time since the 

ﬁrst quarter of 2008, and 

we have now seen eight 

consecutive quarters of 

declines in net charge-offs. 

Nonperforming assets were 

down 36% from 2010.
During the year, we also 
completed our Keyvolution 

expense initiative which 

resulted in annual expense 

savings of more than  

$300 million. Given the 

revenue headwinds that 

continue to face our 

industry, disciplined 

expense management 

remains a critical part of  

our strategy. Keyvolution  
is now part of our normal 
operating rhythm, along  

with our continuous 

improvement process. 
We continued to work on 
aligning our Corporate and 

Community banks to further 

establish our distinctive 

business model. We 

invested for growth by 

adding client-facing 

positions in our Corporate 

and Community banks  

and by building 40 new 

branches as we continued 

to modernize our existing 

network. We also enhanced 

our delivery channels and 

optimized channel usage  

to reduce cost and improve 

the client experience. We 

thoroughly redesigned  

our key.com website and 

expanded our online banking 

capabilities to strengthen 

our service offerings and 

connections with clients.
We continued to work on 
aligning our Corporate and 
Community banks to further

0strate
gy7through our efforts to 
strengthen the alignment 

of our businesses in a way 

that delivers a unique value 

proposition to our clients 

and differentiates Key in  

the marketplace. 
In our Community Bank, 
we continue to add new 

clients and increase their 

level of engagement. We 

also launched KeyBank 

Relationship Rewards.
SM This distinctive, enhanced 

rewards program is 

designed to help us retain, 

expand and strengthen our 

relationships by offering 

clients choices aligned with 

their needs and preferences. 
Our Corporate Bank 
remains focused on 

targeting client segments 

where Key can add the 

most value, which has 

proved successful through 

new and expanded client 

relationships in each of our 

business segments. 
With the right strategy and 
the right model in place, we 

believe focused execution 

will drive our success and 

fuel long-term growth.
Also, Key ranked ﬁfth among 
the top 24 U.S. banks in 

customer satisfaction with 

small business banking, 

according to a study by 

J.D. Power and Associates. 

These results demonstrate 

the success of our client-

focused relationship strategy 

and position us to grow 

through client acquisition, 

retention and satisfaction.
Finally, as previously 
announced, on January 11, 

2012, we signed an 

agreement to acquire  
37 retail branches in Buffalo 
and Rochester, New York, 

strengthening our footprint 

in upstate New York. This is 

an important milestone for 

Key as our strong ﬁnancial 

position enabled us to be 

opportunistic in pursuing  

an exciting opportunity to 

strengthen our franchise, 

which will create long-term 

shareholder value. 
Focused execution 
Focused execution is part 

of our culture. It involves 

working together with 

urgency and discipline 

to win with clients and to 

drive sustainable results. 

It requires actionable 

plans and disciplined 

performance management, 

with an emphasis on clear 

accountability. This is shown 
As part of our focus on 
growing and improving 

the quality of our loan 

portfolio, and to foster 

further economic 

growth and expansion 

in our communities, we 

committed $5 billion in 

loans to qualiﬁed small 

business owners over  

the next three years.
We are pleased by the 
positive survey results that 

tell us that Key’s customer 

satisfaction and retention 

scores continue to exceed 

those of other large U.S. 

banks. These results include 

a survey by the American 

Customer Satisfaction Index 

that shows that – compared 

with the nation’s largest 

banks in the survey – Key  

is one of only two that 

improved its overall 

customer satisfaction score 

for two consecutive years.
In other awards and 
recognitions during the 

year, Greenwich Associates 

named Key a national 

winner of three Greenwich 

Excellence Awards for  

small business and middle 

market banking. 
Results demonstrate the success of our 
client-focused relationship strategy.

discipline9Board of Directors
We welcomed two new 
directors to our Board  

in November 2011.  

Charles P. Cooley and 

William G. Gisel, Jr. bring 

extensive experience in 

ﬁnance, strategic planning 

and consumer products, 

and we look forward to their 

contributions. I also want to 

thank Dr. Carol Cartwright 

who is retiring from the 

Board at our 2012 Annual 

Shareholders Meeting. Her 

keen insight, counsel and 

commitment have been 

much appreciated as she 

helped us navigate the 

incredible turbulence and 

changes faced by Key and 

the banking industry. 
Outlook 
Looking ahead, we remain 

conﬁdent that we will 

continue to make progress 

in 2012 toward achieving 

our long-term goals, 

despite the challenging 

operating environment. As 

we continue to execute our 

relationship strategy, we 

are exhibiting consistent 

positive momentum with 

a business model that 

positions us to compete 

and win in the marketplace. 

We believe the focused 

execution of our strategy 

will improve returns and 

deliver shareholder value.
We are seeing indications 
from our clients that they 

are cautiously optimistic 

about the economy. Many 

of them are beginning to 

make capital investments  

in their operations once 

again, especially to take 

advantage of the historically 

low current interest rates 

and available liquidity.
We remain disciplined in 
the way we manage our 

strong capital position. This 

will allow us to continue to 

support our businesses 

and the needs of our 

clients, as well as evaluate 

other appropriate capital 

deployment opportunities, 

such as potential dividend 

increases and future  

share repurchases. 
As a personal note, I want to 
thank you, our shareholders, 

for your continuing support. 

I have had the great 

pleasure to meet and talk 

with many of you during my 

ﬁrst year as CEO, and I look 
forward to meeting more  
of you and continuing to 
communicate our progress 

in the year ahead.
I also want to thank our 
employees, because it is 

their hard work, dedication 

and commitment to 
executing our strategy  
and living our values that 

sets Key apart.
And, on behalf of our entire 
Company, I thank our 

customers for making Key 

their relationship bank. 
Sincerely,
Beth E. Mooney 
Chairman and  

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

We believe the focused execution of our  
strategy will improve returns and deliver 

shareholder value.

several years narrowing 

its focus on speciﬁc client 

segments and aligning its

With a unique go-to-market

For example, our 
Community and Corporate

relationships is at the core 

of Key’s growth strategy.  

By building enduring 

relationships that stem  

from the value of our 

client-focused solutions  

and extraordinary service, 

Key is able to grow and  

set itself apart from the 

competition. Our culture  

is built upon providing a 

consistent client experience 

at every touch point in the 

organization, which allows 

us to build trust, strengthen 

credibility and deepen  

client relationships. 
Relationships with 
clients enable us to turn 

knowledge and insight into 

value by developing and 

strengthening our broad 

range of products and 

services. Our bankers are 

able to meet client needs 

by delivering customized 

solutions carried out 

with seamless execution 

and superior service. 
Importantly, our clients value 
our relationship strategy.
In support of our 
relationship strategy 

and client focus, Key 
continues to make strategic 
investments that enhance 
our ability to serve clients 

and grow. We have 
opened more than 120 
new branches and have 
completed close to 300 

renovations at existing 

branches since 2007, 

and we continue to add 

client-facing positions. 
In the Corporate Bank, 
we hired more than 100 

senior professionals to our 
platform over the past two 
years. In addition to new 

client-facing positions in 

the Community Bank for 

new branches, we added a 

number of positions serving 

our Small Business and 

Private Banking clients. 

We have also invested 

in our online and mobile 

capabilities to enhance our 

robust functionality for both 

consumers and businesses.
Demonstrating our 
commitment to relationships, 

we launched our enhanced 

KeyBank Relationship 

Rewards
SM program in the 
fall of 2011. This program is 

a compelling incentive for 

new clients to come to Key 

and for existing clients to 

broaden their activities with 

the bank. In an environment 

where other ﬁnancial 

institutions are cutting back 

on similar programs, Key 

wants to reward clients who 

choose us as their primary 

bank. The new rewards 

program has been widely 

accepted, and enrollment 

continues to grow.
At Key, we are committed  
to setting the industry 

standard for customer 

service. The success of our 

client-focused relationship 

strategy is reﬂected in the  

recognition we have received.  
Survey results show that 
Key’s customer satisfaction 

and retention scores 

continue to exceed those  

of other large U.S. banks.  
According to survey  
results from the American 

Customer Satisfaction 

Index, Key’s overall 

customer satisfaction score 

has improved each of the 

last two years. Compared 

with the nation’s largest 

banks noted in the survey, 

Key is one of only two that 

can make that claim. For 

the third year in a row, Key 

has scored higher than our 

largest competitors in 

customer satisfaction. Also, 

J.D. Power and Associates 

ranked Key ﬁfth among  

the top 24 banks in a 

nationwide study measuring 

customer satisfaction with 

small business banking. 

Additionally, Key was 

recognized as a national 

winner of three Greenwich 

Excellence Awards for small 

business banking and 

middle market banking.   
These rankings afﬁrm our 
client-focused relationship 

strategy and validate our 

commitment to deliver 

extraordinary products  

and services.
We are commited to setting the industry 
standard for customer service.
client-focused solutions  
and extraordinary service
values16At Key, we believe being 
a strong bank extends 
beyond being a leading 
provider of ﬁnancial 
services to our customers. 
We are bound by common 
values which we live out 

every day as we stand 
united in a single purpose: 
to help our clients and 
communities thrive. Our 
people care about the 
communities in which 
we do business, which is 
exempliﬁed through the 
numerous ways we strive  
to make a difference.
Community education 
programs, along with our 
ﬁnancing of development 
projects and diversity 
initiatives, are among the 
many ways we invest in  
our communities. Key has 
developed a broad range  
of creative programs 
focused on supporting 
individuals, affordable 
housing and commercial 
development in low- and 
moderate-income areas. 
Key’s economic 
development and 
community reinvestment 
activities consistently 
receive industry-leading 

ratings. In fact, Key is the 
ﬁrst of the nation’s 50 
largest banks to earn seven 
consecutive “outstanding” 
ratings for exceeding the 
terms of the Community 
Reinvestment Act (CRA). 

Key’s “outstanding” rating 
recognizes its investment  
in communities, especially 
underserved neighborhoods, 
and its unique products 

and services for 
underserved clients. 
Additionally, the KeyBank 
Foundation has given more 
than $18 million in each of 
the past three years to 
nonproﬁt organizations 
across our Maine-to-Alaska 
footprint. Our foundation 
continues to make 
investments in economic 
self-sufﬁciency, workforce 
development, ﬁnancial 
education, and diversity. 
Also, in September 2011, 
Key committed to lending 
$5 billion to small businesses 
over the next three years.
Key employees continue 
to give countless volunteer 
hours each year, living 
out their commitment to 

communities through a 
number of events and 
organizations. A few of these 

events and organizations 
are highlighted below.
Neighbors Make  
The Difference
® Day:
 an 
annual event in which our 
employees head out into  

our communities and lend  
a helping hand with nearly 
900 community projects.  
In the last three years, Key 
employees have volunteered 
more than 100,000 hours  
to thousands of nonproﬁt 
organizations.
United Way:
 a nonproﬁt 
organization which works 
to identify and resolve 
community issues. In 2011, 

contributions from Key and 
its employees to United 
Way totaled more than  
$4 million.
Our people care about the communities in which we do business, which is exempliﬁed 
through the numerous ways we strive 
 to make a difference.
commitment  
to our communities
17Highlights of Key’s 2011 
sustainability performance:  
  Formalized our 
commitment to 

environmental stewardship 
  Established a ﬁrst-
generation carbon 

emissions reduction goal 
to reduce Key’s absolute 
carbon footprint by 20%  
by 2016 (compared with 
2009 baseline) 
  Achieved Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental 

Design (LEED) gold 
certiﬁcation for Key’s ﬁrst 
“Green From the Ground 
Up” retail branch
  Financed 580 megawatts 
of clean energy in the 
form of solar projects  
and equipment leases 
  Financed more than 1,000 
megawatts of clean energy 
in wind-turbine projects 
Through a strong sense 
of community and the 

commitment to make 
a difference, Key is 
devoted to its objective 
of improving the quality of 
life and economic vibrancy 
of the places where its 

customers, employees, and 
shareholders live and work.
Super Refund Saturday:
 an annual event where 
hundreds of Key employees 
volunteer to help low- and 
middle-income individuals 
get tax refunds. In 2011, 
Key processed close to 
$4 million in federal tax 
refunds without charge.
In the past two decades, 
employees have given more 
than half a million volunteer 
hours to our communities.  
Commitment  
to sustainability
Sustainability is another 
way in which Key is 
devoted to making a 

difference. We continued  
to make solid progress with 
our sustainability program 
in 2011, and we are 
committed to improving our 

environmental performance 
and increasing efﬁciency, 
which we believe will 
improve our bottom-line 
performance. We are 
continuing to develop  
a full range of programs, 
including: better managing 
the effects of climate 
change and related risks to 

our business, reducing our 

energy consumption and 

greenhouse gas emissions, 
reducing waste, and 
expanding our recycling 
programs. We are also 
establishing measurement 
and reporting systems to 
create more transparency 
to Key’s environmental 
and social performance. 
In addition, we remain 
committed to investments 
in clean energy.
