                Dear Fellow Shareholders, Clients and Employees,˜ 
In 2014 we continued on our path to reposition our company Œ the Investments Company for the 
World Œ to become an even stronger strategic partner to our clients. It was a year of signi˚cant 

achievement in our Investment Services and Investment Management businesses, yet we still 

have not realized our full potential. We increased assets under custody and/or administration to 

$28.5 trillion and assets under management (AUM) to $1.7 trillion, retaining our leadership 

position in the markets we serve. Our market capitalization grew 14 percent to more than 

$45 billion. And our total shareholder return again beat the median of the S&P Financials Index 

and of our peer group. These are all good measures of improved performance and value creation. 
While these are all positive achievements, growing revenues across many of our businesses 
continued to be a challenge and our top-line revenues did not meet our plan. The strong U.S. 
equity market performance was not enough to offset continued low interest rates, low market 

volatility and weak equity market performance outside the U.S. To offset these weaknesses, we 

focused intently on what we could control Œ expenses. In that regard, in 2014 many of the 

initiatives we put in place in prior years really started paying off. On an operating basis, expenses 

declined by 2 percent
i versus 2013 and were signi˚cantly below our plan for the year. So, despite 
soft revenues, our strong expense management resulted in positive operating leverage,Œ a key 

goal for us. 
While that is the story on an operating basis, I must note the signi˚cant one-time legal charges 
and restructuring expenses we took during the year. Factoring in these items, overall noninterest 

expenses grew by 8 percent year over year. However, these charges enabled us to put a number 

of signi˚cant legal matters behind us, which we expect to lower our expense run rate in 2015 

and beyond. 
What we also recognize is that clients expect more from us, just as we expect more of ourselves. 
The pace of global change is accelerating and we need to deliver more, better and even faster 

than we did before. 
We know we cannot solely rely on unpredictable markets to achieve results, so we put in place a 
three-year plan, which we publicly shared in October, to deliver increased value to our sharehold˝

ers. Our goal is to deliver revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth that is not dependent on 

an improved interest-rate and economic environment. The work we™ve done to invest in revenue 

opportunities to increase our pro˚tability, and to streamline the company for improved ef˚ciency, 

is positioning us to deliver even stronger future results. 
During 2014, we also strengthened our executive management team by adding new talent and 
placing existing leaders into new roles that leverage their capabilities and expertise. These moves 

will enable us to become a more nimble, thoughtful, productive and cost-effective service provid˝

er and investment manager. We hired and promoted some outstanding new leaders with proven 

track records of driving change and improving performance. Our new Chief Human Resources 

Of˚cer, for example, is experienced at developing leadership talent. Our new Chief Risk Of˚cer 
is a recognized expert in his ˚eld who will help us meet or exceed regulatory requirements with 

respect to our ˚nancial strength, risk management practices and integrity. Our new head of Client 
Service Delivery brings considerable public and private sector expertise in restructuring and 

modernizing large, complex organizations to create better experiences for clients. And our new 

General Counsel is helping us make substantial progress in addressing and resolving our most 

signi˚cant legal matters. 
                   We have a new CEO of Investment Services, who is leading our business improvement efforts 
and has a strong track record of success in operations and technology development Œ keys to 
driving pro˚tability in our services business. We also broadened the responsibilities of our 
CEO of Investment Management to include oversight of our Markets Group, capitalizing on 

his extensive experience in the ˚xed-income and capital markets. 
We strengthened our corporate governance by appointing three new directors to our Board in 
2014 and one more in early 2015. They possess a wealth of relevant experience and complement 

our existing directors; 14 of our 15 directors are independent. 
Before turning to our strategic priorities, let™s recap our 2014 performance. 
SUMMARY OF 2014 FINANCIAL RESULTS, YEAR-OVER-YEAR 
REVENUE GROWTH:
 Revenue was up 4 percent, or down 1 percent on an adjusted basis.
i Challenging market conditions impeded some of our growth, and we did not achieve all of 
the performance goals we had initially set. 
In Investment Management, we bene˚ted from an increased appetite for liability-driven 
investments (LDI) as clients sought to better manage the risk in their pension plans. We also saw 

greater interest in alternative investments as clients increased allocations to higher-growth 

hedge fund, real estate and private equity investments. Additionally, we have begun to bene˚t 

from the investments we™re making to expand our Wealth Management business into new U.S. 

locations. 
In Investment Services, we continued to achieve strong growth in clearing and global collateral 
services, where we have been focused on broadening our unique suite of solutions for clients. The 

decline in Corporate Trust appears close to being over and should begin to contribute to revenue 

growth in 2015. Asset Servicing is in the midst of a transformation designed to improve pro˚tabil˝

ity and the value we deliver to clients as we consolidate platforms and functions to make it easier 

for clients to do business with us. Our goal is to drive down our costs, leverage our scale and be 

the preferred provider of value-added solutions to our clients across Investment Services. 
GENERATED POSITIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE:
 We controlled our operating expenses well, even 
while absorbing elevated regulatory compliance costs and making investments in our business to 

support future growth. On an adjusted basis, expenses were down 2 percent 
i year over year and 
well below our original plan, and we generated positive operating leverage of 87 basis points.
i So, 
while revenue growth was soft, our intense focus on expense control paid off and helped create 

shareholder value. 
INCREASED EARNINGS PER SHARE: 
On a GAAP basis, we earned $2.15 per share in 2014, up 
24 percent compared to 2013. Those results include a signi˚cant after-tax legal expense in the 
fourth quarter to address a number of legacy litigation matters, including substantially all of 

the foreign exchange-related actions. We believe that taking this charge at this time is both 

necessary and appropriate, as we take a pragmatic approach to resolving legal matters. This 

action also allows us to concentrate our efforts on serving our clients for the future. 
On an adjusted basis, we earned $2.39 per share, slightly below our plan but up 5 percent from 
last year™s adjusted EPS.
i This was driven by modest growth in assets and market values, and 
our success in winning new business and keeping expenses well controlled. 
INCREASED RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (TCE):
 We achieved a healthy TCE return 
of 16 percent, up from 15.3 percent
i in 2013, which is higher than our peer group median and a 
good measure of the value we are creating from the investments we are making. 
II                       
        
 MAINTAINED OUR STRONG CAPITAL POSITION: 
Our transitional Standardized Approach common 
equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) was 15 percent and our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio 
(CET1) under the fully phased-in Advanced Approach stood at 9.8 percent at December 31, 2014.
i Both measures re˜ect our ˚nancial strength, and we believe we are well positioned to more than 
meet our regulatory capital requirements into the future. 
RETURNED VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS:
 We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 
13 percent and repurchased more than $1.7 billion of our common stock, resulting in an earnings 

payout ratio of 98 percent for 2014. This rate of return is among the highest in the industry and a 

strength of our company. 
ACHIEVED STRONG TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR): 
Our TSR was 18 percent for 2014 and 
117 percent over the past three years. In both cases, we outperformed the median of the S&P 
Financials Index and of our peer group. 
OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND ACTIONS TO DRIVE LONG-TERM GROWTH 
Over the long term, our strategy is designed to create economic value for our company and our 

clients by differentiating our services to strengthen and capitalize on our unique competitive 

advantages. We have a clear set of strategic priorities to accelerate our progress. They include: 
Improving our business processes, productivity and effectiveness while controlling 
expenses and enhancing our ef˚ciency; 
Driving revenue growth by leveraging our expertise and scale to offer broad-based, 

innovative solutions to clients; 
Being a strong, trusted counterparty by maintaining our safety, soundness and 

industry-leading liquidity and capital positions; 
Generating excess capital and deploying it effectively; and 
Attracting and retaining top talent. 
IMPROVING BUSINESS PROCESSES, PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS 

We are taking action from top to bottom to further transform our company through a continuous 

improvement process. It™s succeeding in enhancing productivity and service quality and reduc˝

ing costs and risk throughout the organization. We™ve already accomplished speci˚c initiatives 

to help us fund client solutions, implement regulatory changes and drive ef˚ciency, and we™ve 

identi˚ed additional opportunities. These productivity gains are allowing us to fund initiatives to 

increase pro˚table revenue growth and improve our bottom line. In addition, we continue to 

examine our portfolio of businesses. We exited several that didn™t ˚t strategically or weren™t 

yielding expected results, thus freeing up resources to address our top priorities. 
Our accomplishments include: Streamlining our organization by reducing staff levels and layers, which is expected to yield 
more than $100 million in run-rate savings, $50 million of which has already been realized 

in 2014. Eliminating 750,000 square feet of space in downtown Manhattan and beginning the planned 

consolidation of our Pittsburgh locations. We will do the same in other locations globally. 
Consolidating operating platforms to reduce costs and simplify our infrastructure. For 

example, in 2014, we reduced our custody platforms from three to two and expect to be 

down to one by early 2016.

 Increasing the return on our technology investments by shifting more of our dollars from 
tactical to strategic initiatives and reducing application development costs. 
Refocusing on our core businesses through a number of actions, including: 
-Restructuring our Markets Group to reduce costs and exit some businesses that were 
too capital-intensive or lacked effective size and scale. 
-Shutting down our futures commission merchant derivatives clearing businesses in the 
U.S.
  and Germany and selling our Corporate Trust business in Japan and Mexico. 
-Selling our investment in Wing Hang Bank. 
DRIVING REVENUE GROWTH 

The combined capabilities and intellectual capital of Investment Services and Investment 

Management enable us to create additional value for clients and solutions that, in many cases, 

our competitors can™t match. We are driving revenue growth by leveraging our expertise and scale 

to offer broad-based, innovative solutions to our clients. 
Leveraging Our Expertise and Scale 
We are leveraging both our expertise and scale to deliver value to our stakeholders in many ways. 
A few examples: 

We established our fourth innovation center, in California™s Silicon Valley, to support our ability 
to harness emerging and disruptive technologies to gain new business insights, develop 

innovative operational and technological capabilities, identify and hire top talent, and 

pinpoint potential new ventures. 
We created a new Markets Group that brings together the capabilities and talents of our 

Foreign Exchange, Securities Finance, Collateral Management and Segregation, Capital 

Markets and Prime Brokerage businesses to meet the evolving trading, ˚nancing and 

securities-lending requirements of our clients. We are combining our broad set of capabilities 

to create unique and integrated solutions that deliver improved value to both the buy and sell 

sides by reducing ˚nancing costs, addressing liquidity needs and helping clients navigate 

risks that drive positive investment performance. 
We built a separately managed account capability in Asia through Pershing and placed our 

Investment Management products on the new platform. It™s a great collaboration that is 

helping private banks and wealth managers serve their customers. 
We are now extending our private banking solutions, including credit lines and jumbo 

mortgages, to Pershing™s independent registered investment advisor clients. We made 

more than $500 million in loans through this channel in the second half of 2014 alone. 
Delivering Innovative Solutions to Our Clients 

We™ve made a number of enhancements and investments to drive revenue and earnings growth 

into the future and extend our leadership positions in the global markets we serve. 
Within Investment Services: 

Technology is a strategic asset for our company. Our scale, combined with the investments 
we are making in our technology platforms, drives development of innovative solutions and 

enables our ˚nancial institution clients to provide their customers with top-tier, multi-class 

capabilities without investing in infrastructure themselves. They gain a better product at a 

lower price, improving their pro˚tability. Our strategy of owning our technology infrastructure 

and application development, and insourcing the people who power it, has enabled us to 

improve our results and reduce costs while retaining the institutional knowledge in-house. 

We believe this provides us with a competitive advantage. Additionally, this strategy is 

allowing us to team with our clients more ef˚ciently and help them solve their most 

pressing needs. It™s simply making us a smarter, more agile partner. 
IV            
        
     
    
      
    
 
 
            We™ve also created a dedicated technology solutions unit that allows clients to leverage our 

scale and utilize our proprietary applications to improve their pro˚tability. 
We are enhancing our collateral management systems and foreign exchange (FX) electronic 

trading platforms to provide broader capabilities for term ˚nancing, securities lending, 

managing collateral and capturing more FX trading volume. 
Within Investment Management: 
We are broadening the distribution of our investment strategies to the retail intermediary 
and retirement channels, leveraging the Pershing and Dreyfus platforms to reach 

individuals through broker-dealers and ˚nancial advisors. We are providing a wide range of 

registered investment advisors across the country with access to the broad, deep capabilities 

of the largest investments companies in the world Œ capabilities they could not afford at the 

cost and speed at which we can deliver them Œ helping them remain competitive in the 

marketplace. 
We have been promoting our Wealth Management brand and expanding our sales force in 

attractive new U.S. markets, an initiative that is already accelerating our revenue growth. 
Regulatory changes are driving certain traditional banking activities away from banks and 

toward investment managers, including lending and the management of ˚xed-income assets 

in pension funds. We are investing in and structuring ourselves to capitalize on this trend, 

and we are already experiencing growth in these areas. 
At the beginning of 2015, we closed our acquisition of Cutwater Asset Management, 

a U.S.-based ˚xed-income and solutions specialist with a 20-year track record and 

approximately $23 billion in AUM. Cutwater is working closely with Insight, our highly 

successful LDI specialty boutique, allowing us to extend our LDI and ˚xed-income 

specialist strategies into the U.S. market. 
BEING A STRONG, TRUSTED COUNTERPARTY 

Our status as a strong, trusted counterparty re˜ects the strength of our balance sheet, our overall 

liquidity and capital positions, and our reputation as a sound and safe institution. Our high credit 

ratings allow us to assist with balance-sheet management and the overall securities ˚nancing 

needs of our clients. 
Our continued investment in and focus on compliance, risk management and control functions 
help us protect our strong capital position and enhance our status as a trusted counterparty. 

We are also strengthening our technology to capture real-time data to improve our Œ and our 

clients™ Œ decision-making. 
Being a strong, trusted counterparty also means that every employee must recognize the vital 
role we play in maintaining the safety and soundness of the ˚nancial markets. It is a role that 

bears enormous responsibility and our integrity must never be compromised. Thus, we continue 

to emphasize through our training and leadership programs, and throughout all of our employee 

communications, the importance of building a culture of doing what™s right, all of the time. 
GENERATING EXCESS CAPITAL AND DEPLOYING IT EFFECTIVELY 
Over the last three years, we™ve generated approximately $10 billion of tangible capital. We have 

a disciplined governance model designed to deploy capital effectively to fuel future growth and 

increase value to shareholders. We consider acquisitions only when they enhance our core 

strategy, exceed our internal rate of return and stand to achieve targeted outcomes faster and 

more ef˚ciently than could be achieved through organic means. Our ability to generate capital 

positions us well to comply with the new capital and liquidity requirements and, at the same 

time, improve our ability to meet our net-interest-income objectives. 
V          ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TOP TALENT 
Our investments expertise is unparalleled, re˜ecting the strength of our people and a 

high-performance culture built on a foundation of enduring values. 
We focus on attracting and retaining the most talented professionals in our industry across all 
disciplines. Our philosophy is simple: if we are invested in attracting and developing team mem˝

bers to the fullest, providing them with a dynamic and diverse workplace and giving them ample 

opportunities to contribute, then they will stay, succeed and deliver excellence to our clients. 
TAKING CARE OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE WORK AND LIVE 
What we do really matters. In addition to the services, strategies and advice we offer to help our 

clients meet their ˚nancial goals and responsibilities, we also help address some of the most 

serious challenges facing society today through a sustained commitment to corporate social 

responsibility (CSR). 
Our total employee and company contributions to charities in communities around the world 
increased in 2014 to $38 million, up 12 percent from 2013, including donations to support Ebola 

relief efforts. As part of our Powering Potential philanthropic focus, we continued to work with our 

community partners to provide basic needs such as food, clothing and housing and expand our 

support for job training and development programs that can lead to better jobs and self-

suf˚ciency. And, as part of our effort to use investments to drive positive change, we are piloting 

a social innovation challenge to bring entrepreneurial ideas to social problems in a manner that 

also produces investment returns. We have also been a leading advocate within the United 

Nations for improved rule of law Œ advancing both human rights for all and the ability of invest˝

ments to better ˜ow to developing countries. It™s the right thing to do and it™s good for business. 
We focus on eight CSR priorities: risk and reliability; strong governance; employee engagement; 
diversity and inclusion; learning and development; social ˚nance; community commitment; and 

environmental management. Re˜ecting our continued progress in these areas, our company was 

named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), one of the most highly regarded global 

sustainability indices, for the second consecutive year. In addition, we received perfect scores for 

climate change disclosure and performance in the Carbon Disclosure Project™s S&P 500 Climate 

Performance Leadership Index 2014 and its S&P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index 2014, 

becoming the only U.S. ˚nancial company and one of only two S&P 500 companies to achieve the 

top score two years in a row. 
VI     
                  LOOKING FORWARD 
The actions we™ve taken to bolster our organization have positioned us to execute against our 
performance goals. The foundation for our future has never been stronger. 
At our Investor Day in October 2014, we set three-year performance goals
ii that call for healthy 
earnings growth that is not dependent on a normalizing market Œ i.e., improvement in both the 
forward curve in interest rates and the economic environment. We are targeting: 
Revenue growth of 3.5 to 4.5 percent in a ˜at interest-rate environment and 6 to 8 percent 
in a normalizing market; 
EPS growth of 7 to 9 percent in a ˜at-rate environment and 12 to 15 percent in a 

normalizing market; and 
Return on tangible common equity of 17 to 19 percent with no rate changes and 20 to 

22 percent in a normalizing market. 
We are con˚dent we can deliver on these targets. 
I want to thank all of our team members and my Executive Committee partners for their resolve 
to realize the promise of our remarkable franchise for the bene˚t of our clients, shareholders, 

employees and communities. Our people are a rich source of competitive advantage Œ experts in 

our ˚eld who are passionate about and creative in solving the challenges facing our clients today 

and in the coming years. 
I also wish to acknowledge our Board of Directors for their support and wise counsel. I note 
with sadness the passing of Ruth E. Bruch, who served on our board with distinction for more 

than a decade. 
Thank you for your continuing support of our great company Œ the Investments Company for 
the World.

VII                             About BNY Mellon 
OUR DISTINCTIVE AND ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL 

BNY Mellon is an investments company. We manage and service ˚nancial assets. That™s what 

we do. Our business model is driven by twin engines of growth that span the entire investment 

lifecycle: Investment Services and Investment Management. We service ˚nancial assets through 

Investment Services, manage them through the 13 investment management boutiques within In˝

vestment Management and provide investment advice through our wealth management offerings. 
This broad and diverse set of capabilities is centered on a simple idea Œ that, over time, ˚nancial 
asset growth will exceed economic growth, creating the opportunity for excess return. Given our 

global scale and diversity, we see more, and can deliver more, placing us in a strong position 

competitively. 
Our business model is fee-based, with fees representing more than 80 percent of our revenues. 
The vast majority of those fees are recurring. We can therefore grow our business without the 

need to extend credit support. Our credit ratings, capital ratios and payout ratio are each among 

the highest in the industry. 
Our global strategy is powered by a strong and engaged leadership team, board of directors, and 
talented employees. They focus on delivering insightful advice; innovative, value-added solutions; 

and world-class service to our clients that drive long-term value to our shareholders. 
LONG-TERM TRENDS FUEL OUR GROWTH 
The drivers that create demand for our business model remain strong. 
Individuals increasingly need to save and invest for their long-term needs. 
Maturing economies are investing in infrastructure and other economic development 
programs to improve and stimulate their own growth rates. 
Capital rules and other regulations are dictating that investment managers and capital 

markets providers become the suppliers of capital. 
Investors are seeking strategies and insights that appropriately balance risk/return 

rewards throughout the cycle. 
Cost and capital pressures are compelling ˚nancial institutions to seek a scalable, more 

variable-cost servicing model, including technology platforms that offer a variety of 

applications that can help them succeed with their customers. 
Investors are requiring greater transparency into various investment strategies and better 

risk analytics. 
We are a global leader in almost every aspect of servicing ˚nancial assets. Our broad set of 

capabilities and advanced technology platforms enable speed to market and drive innovative, 

cost-effective solutions and growth opportunities unique to BNY Mellon. 
We also have investment management strategies to purchase securities by all forms of issuers, 
from credit products to developed and emerging equities. We have become the seventh-largest 

investment manager in the world Œ up from eighth just a year ago Œ by offering timely, insightful 

strategies and attractive investment performance. 
VIII       OUR CLIENTS 
As a result of our leading and broad-based positions in both the Investment Services and Invest˝

ment Management businesses, our client base comprises a unique set of ˚nancial market leaders 

Œ buy side, sell side, governments and market infrastructure providers. Our clients include more 

than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies, 75 central banks that hold more than 90 percent of all 

capital, and more than two-thirds of the top 1,000 pension funds. Most of our clients utilize both 

major business lines, giving us dual revenue streams. Approximately 75 percent of our top 100 

clients are enterprise clients Œ using the services of both Investment Services and Investment 

Management Œ that contribute approximately $3 billion in revenue. 
PARTNERING WITH OUR CLIENTS TO DRIVE THEIR SUCCESS 
We are partnering with clients to help them with solutions to better manage their risk position 

and make better-informed investment decisions. 
Our client coverage model is organized around the needs of key client segments. We have 
full-service teams focused on the needs of investment managers; insurance companies; 

banks, broker-dealers and advisors; corporate and public ˚nance; and alternative asset 

managers. This alignment positions us to develop more sophisticated and innovative solutions 

for them.

(h) Beginning in 2014, risk-based capital ratios include the net impact of the total consolidated assets of certain consolidated investment management funds 
in risk-weighted assets. These assets were not included in prior periods™ risk-based ratios.  The leverage capital ratio was not impacted. 
(i) At Dec. 31, 2014, the CET1, Tier 1 and Total risk-based regulatory capital ratios are based on Basel III components of capital, as phased-in, and asset 

risk-weightings using the Advanced Approach framework.  The leverage capital ratio is based on Basel III components of capital and quarterly average 

total assets, as phased-in. The capital ratios prior to Dec. 31, 2014 are based on Basel I rules (including Basel I Tier 1 common in the case of the CET1 

ratio). For additional information on these ratios, see ﬁCapitalﬂ beginning on page 61.  
(j) The estimated fully phased-in CET1 ratios are based on our interpretation of the final capital rules released by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013 (the 

ﬁFinal Capital Rulesﬂ), which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period.  For additional information on these ratios, see ﬁCapitalﬂ 

beginning on page 61. (k) The estimated fully phased-in SLR as of Dec. 31, 2014 is based on our interpretation of the Final Capital Rules, as supplemented by the Federal Reserve™s 

final rules on the SLR. When fully phased-in, we expect to maintain an SLR of over 5%, 3% attributable to the minimum required SLR, and greater than 

2% attributable to a buffer applicable to U.S. G-SIBs. BNY Mellon 3

ﬁus,ﬂ ﬁBNY Mellon,ﬂ the ﬁCompanyﬂ and similar 
terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon 
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The 
term ﬁParentﬂ refers to The Bank of New York

differ from those estimated or anticipated in certain 
forward-looking statements contained herein for reasons which are discussed below and under the heading ﬁForward-looking Statements.ﬂ When used 
in this Annual Report, words such as ﬁestimate,ﬂ

similar meaning, signify forward-looking statements. Certain business terms and commonly used acronyms used in this Annual Report are defined in the 

Glossary and Acronyms sections. 
The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 
report. Investors should also read the section titled 

ﬁForward-looking Statements.ﬂ How we reported results 

Throughout this Annual Report, certain measures, 
which are noted as ﬁNon-GAAP financial measures,ﬂ 

exclude certain items or otherwise include 
components that differ from GAAP.  BNY Mellon 

believes that these measures are useful to investors 
because they permit a focus on period-to-period 
comparisons using measures that relate to our ability 
to enhance revenues and limit expenses in 
circumstances where such matters are within our 
control. We also present the net interest margin on an 

FTE basis. We believe that this presentation allows 

for comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Certain immaterial reclassifications 

have been made to prior periods to place them on a 
basis comparable with the current period 
presentation. See ﬁSupplemental information -
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial 

measuresﬂ beginning on page 128 for a reconciliation 
of financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP to adjusted Non-GAAP financial 
measures. In 2014, BNY Mellon elected to early adopt the new 
accounting guidance included in ASU 2014-01, 
ﬁAccounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable 

Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB 

Emerging Issues Task Force.ﬂ  As a result, we 

restated the prior period financial statements to reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the new accounting guidance. See Note 2 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. When in this Annual Report we refer to BNY 
Mellon™s or our bank subsidiary™s ﬁBasel Iﬂ capital 

measures, we mean those capital measures, as 
calculated under the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System™s (the ﬁFederal Reserveﬂ) 

risk-based capital rules that are based on the 1988 
Basel Accord, which is often referred to as ﬁBasel I.ﬂ  

Similarly, when in this Annual Report we refer to 

BNY Mellon™s ﬁBasel IIIﬂ capital measures (e.g., 

Basel III CET1), we mean those capital measures as 
calculated under the final revised capital rules (the 
ﬁFinal Capital Rulesﬂ) released by the Federal 
Reserve on July 2, 2013. All information for 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in this 
Annual Report is reported on a net income basis. On 

Jan. 15, 2010, BNY Mellon sold Mellon United 

National Bank, our former national bank subsidiary 
located in Florida. We applied discontinued 

operations accounting to this business. As a result, 

certain information for 2010 in this Annual Report is 

reported on a continuing operations basis. Overview BNY Mellon is the corporate brand of The Bank of 
New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE symbol: BK).  
BNY Mellon is a global investments company 
dedicated to helping its clients manage and service their financial assets throughout the investment lifecycle. Whether providing financial services for 
institutions, corporations or individual investors,  4 BNY Mellon 
  Results of Operations (continued) BNY Mellon delivers informed investment 
management and investment services in 35 countries 
and more than 100 markets. As of Dec. 31, 2014, 

BNY Mellon had $28.5 trillion in assets under 

custody and/or administration, and $1.7 trillion in 

assets under management. BNY Mellon can act as a 

single point of contact for clients looking to create, 
trade, hold, manage, service, distribute or restructure 
investments. Strategy and priorities 
BNY Mellon™s businesses benefit from the global 
growth in financial assets, the globalization of the 
investment process, changes in demographics and the 
continued evolution of the regulatory landscape -
each providing us with opportunities to advise and 
service clients. Over the long term, our strategy is 

designed to create economic value by differentiating 

our services to create competitive advantages that 
will deliver value to our clients and shareholders. Our top priorities include: Ł improving our business processes, productivity 
and effectiveness while controlling expenses and 

enhancing our efficiency; 
Ł driving revenue growth by leveraging our 
expertise and scale to offer broad-based, 

innovative solutions to clients; Ł being a strong, trusted counterparty by 
maintaining our safety and soundness and 
industry-leading liquidity and capital positions; Ł generating excess capital and deploying it 
effectively; and 
Ł attracting and retaining top talent. Key initiatives Within Investment Services, we are: 

Ł making strategic platform investments in high-growth markets to help clients lower their costs, 
reduce capital investments and improve 
profitability; Ł enhancing our collateral services and foreign 
exchange trading platforms to provide clients 
with broader capabilities; Ł creating market-leading, technology-driven 
solutions for clients to generate high-value, 
recurring-fee revenue growth through a newly 
formed Technology Solutions Group; and 
Ł transforming our company through a continuous 
improvement process to help us fund client solutions, regulatory change and transformation 
initiatives, while increasing efficiency and 

improving our operating margin over the next 

three years -- through 2017. Within Investment Management, we are: 
Ł expanding the distribution of our investment strategies to targeted client segments through 

U.S. intermediary channels by realigning and 
bolstering our Sales, Marketing and Product 
functions; Łpromoting our Wealth Management brand by 

broadening the distribution of our value-added 
solutions in targeted U.S locations; and €
Ł connecting our Wealth Management services to 

the rest of BNY Mellon by offering solutions to 

Pershing clients. As we execute our strategy, we are continuing to 

drive efficient regulatory compliance for us and for 

our clients globally.  Excellence in risk management 

is essential and we continue to invest in systems to 
comply with global regulations. Maintaining our 

strong capital position is a priority as we seek to 
maintain our balance sheet strength and deploy our 
capital efficiently to fuel future growth and to return 

value to shareholders. With respect to our Basel III CET1, which is a 
measure of our financial strength, our current target is 

to maintain our ratio more than 100 basis points 
above the regulatory minimum guidelines. As a U.S. 

G-SIB, we will be subject to the Basel III SLR. We 

expect to establish a target Basel III SLR as we move 

closer to implementation in 2018. As we discussed at our Investor Day in October 2014, our key initiatives -- driving organic revenue growth, 

lowering costs and reducing risks -- will extend into 
2015 and beyond as we continue to transform our 
company to remain a global leader in investment 
services and investment management. Key 2014 and subsequent events 
Litigation expense 
In February 2015, BNY Mellon adjusted its financial 
results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014 to 

include an additional after-tax litigation expense of 

$598 million in anticipation of the resolution of 
several previously disclosed matters, including BNY Mellon 5 
  Results of Operations (continued)substantially all of the foreign exchange-related actions. Real estate fund administration outsourcing 

In February 2015, BNY Mellon announced an 
outsourcing agreement with Deutsche Asset & Wealth 

Management. Under the agreement, BNY Mellon 

will provide direct real estate and infrastructure fund 
finance, fund accounting, asset management 
accounting, and client and financial reporting 
functions for Deutsche Asset & Wealth 

Management™s approximately $46 billion in assets 

under administration. Acquisition of Cutwater Asset Management 

In January 2015, BNY Mellon completed the 
acquisition of Cutwater 

based fixed income and solutions specialist with 
approximately $23 billion in assets under 
management at acquisition. Cutwater will work 

closely with Insight Investment, a leading European 
asset manager and one of BNY Mellon™s premier 

investment firms. Completion of federal income tax exam 
In November 2014, the IRS notified us that our carryback claim was approved. As a result, our 

federal income tax returns are closed to further 
examination through 2010. A tax benefit of $150 

million primarily for the tax carryback claim was 
reflected in the results for fourth quarter of 2014. For 

additional information, see Note 12 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Exit of the derivatives sales and trading business 
In September 2014, BNY Mellon announced that it 
repositioned the BNY Mellon Markets Groups and 

will be exiting the derivatives sales and trading 
business over the next several years. This action will 

be beneficial to our operating margin and return on 

capital. Corporate headquarters In September 2014, BNY Mellon sold its One Wall 
Street office building in lower Manhattan for $585 

million. BNY Mellon has occupied the 50 story, 1.1 

million square foot building since 1989. The sale 
resulted in an after-tax gain of $204 million, or $346 

million pre-tax. Supplementary leverage ratio 
The Final Capital Rules include a minimum 3% SLR to become effective as a binding ratio on Jan. 1, 2018, 

although commencing in January 2015 each 
Advanced Approaches banking organization is 

required to calculate and report its SLR. On Sept. 3, 2014, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule implementing the enhanced SLR. 
An enhanced SLR applicable to BNY Mellon and the 

other U.S. G-SIB bank holding companies will 
require a buffer in excess of 2% over the minimum 

3% SLR, for a total SLR in excess of 5%. In 

addition, the eight U.S. G-SIBs™ insured depository 

institution subsidiaries, regardless of the amount of 
their consolidated assets or assets under custody, must 

maintain a 6% SLR to be considered ﬁwell 
capitalized.ﬂ BNY Mellon™s estimated fully phased-in SLR of 
4.4% at Dec. 31, 2014 was based on our 
interpretation of the Final Capital Rules, as 
supplemented by the final rules implementing the 
SLR. BNY Mellon expects to fully satisfy the requirements 
of the SLR on or before it is phased-in. For 

additional information regarding the SLR, see 
ﬁSupervision and Regulation - Basel III Final Capital 
Rules or Proposals.ﬂ Liquidity coverage ratio 
The Basel III framework requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against 

specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some 
respects to liquidity measures historically applied by 
banks and regulators for management and supervisory 
purposes, will be required by regulation. One test, 

referred to as the LCR, is designed to ensure that 
certain banking organizations, including BNY 

Mellon, maintain a minimum amount of 
unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net 

cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute 
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon. 
For additional information on HQLA, see ﬁLiquidity 
and Dividendsﬂ and ﬁSupervision and Regulation -
Liquidity Standards - Basel III and U.S. Proposals.ﬂ  6 BNY Mellon 
 Results of Operations (continued) On Sept. 3, 2014, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule (the ﬁFinal LCR Ruleﬂ) to 
implement the LCR in the U.S. Since Jan. 1, 2015, 

covered companies, including BNY Mellon, The 

Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., 

have been required to meet an LCR of 80%, 
calculated monthly for a six month period, after 
which the LCR must be calculated daily.  The 

required minimum LCR level will increase annually 
by 10% increments until Jan. 1, 2017, at which time 
we will be required to meet an LCR of 100%. As of 

January 2015, based on our interpretation of the Final 
LCR Rule, we believe we are in compliance with 
applicable LCR requirements on a phased-in basis. 
For additional information on the LCR, see 
ﬁSupervision and Regulation - Liquidity Standards -
Basel III and U.S. Proposals.ﬂ Sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang Bank 
Limited (ﬁWing Hangﬂ) 
In July 2014, BNY International Financing Corp., a 
subsidiary of BNY Mellon, sold our equity 

investment in Wing Hang, which is located in Hong 

Kong, to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation 
Limited, resulting in an after-tax gain of $315 

million, or $490 million pre-tax. Equity income 

related to our investment in Wing Hang totaled $20 

million through July of 2014 and $95 million in full-
year 2013, including $37 million from the sale of a 
property. 
Acquisition of HedgeMark International, LLC 
In May 2014, BNY Mellon acquired the remaining 
65% interest of HedgeMark International, LLC, a 
provider of hedge fund managed account and risk 
analytic services. Since 2011, BNY Mellon has held 

a 35% ownership stake in HedgeMark. Organizational changes 

BNY Mellon announced a series of organizational 
changes as follows: Ł Curtis Arledge, currently Vice Chairman and 
CEO of Investment Management, added to his 
responsibilities the oversight for a newly formed 
BNY Mellon Markets Group.  The BNY Mellon 

Markets Group includes Global Markets, Global 
Collateral Services and Prime Services. 

day operations of the group will be managed by Kurt Woetzel, the President of the BNY Mellon 

Markets Group. Ł Brian Shea was appointed Vice Chairman and 

CEO of Investment Services, in addition to his 
oversight of Client Service Delivery and Client 
Technology Solutions.  
Ł Monique Herena was appointed Senior Executive 
Vice President and Chief Human Resources 

Officer. 
Ł Kevin McCarthy was appointed Senior Executive 
Vice President and General Counsel. 
Ł James S. Wiener was appointed Senior Executive 

Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. 
Ł Douglas Shulman was appointed Senior 
Executive Vice President and Global Head of 

Client Service Delivery. 
Restructuring charge 
In 2014, BNY Mellon recorded an after-tax 
restructuring charge of $110 million, or $177 million 

pre-tax, primarily reflecting severance expense 
relating to streamlining actions. Streamlining actions 

include rationalizing our staff and simplifying and 

automating global processes across Investment 
Services, technology and operations. Charge related to certain administrative errors 

In 2014, BNY Mellon recorded a pre-tax charge of 
$104 million, net of incentives, in connection with the 
previously disclosed administrative errors relating to 
certain offshore tax-exempt funds that we manage.  

The errors relate to the resident status of such funds. Capital plan and share repurchase program and 
dividend increase 
In March 2014, BNY Mellon received confirmation 
that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2014 
capital plan submitted in connection with CCAR. 
The board of directors subsequently approved the 
repurchase of up to $1.74 billion worth of common 
stock beginning in the second quarter of 2014 and 
continuing through the first quarter of 2015. In 2014, we repurchased 46.2 million common shares 
at an average price of $36.13 per common share for a 

total of $1.7 billion.  We continued to repurchase 

shares in the first quarter of 2015 under the 2014 
capital plan and expect to substantially complete our 
authorized repurchase of $425 million worth of 
common shares in the first quarter of 2015. BNY Mellon 7 
        Results of Operations (continued)On April 7, 2014, the board of directors also 
approved a 13% increase in BNY Mellon™s quarterly 

common stock dividend from $0.15 per common 
share to $0.17 per common share. We submitted our 2015 capital plan on Jan. 5, 2015.  
The Federal Reserve has indicated it expects to 
publish its objection or non-objection to the capital 
plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend 
payments and share repurchases, in March 2015. We 

anticipate announcing our 2015 capital plan shortly 
thereafter. 
Exit from parallel run period for calculating risk-
weighted assets under the Advanced Approach rule 
On Feb. 21, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had been approved to exit parallel 

run reporting for U.S. regulatory capital purposes. As 

a result, on April 1, 2014, BNY Mellon transitioned 

from the general risk-based capital rules to the Final 
Capital Rules™Advanced Approach, subject to 

ongoing qualification. We were required to comply 

with Advanced Approach reporting and public 

disclosures commencing on June 30, 2014. This 

means our CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios are 

determined using the higher of the risk-weighted 
assets as calculated under the general risk-based 
capital rules (which use Basel I-based risk weighting 
for 2014 and the Final Capital Rules™ new 

Standardized Approach commencing on Jan. 1, 2015) 

and under the Advanced Approach. 
In each reporting quarter since exiting parallel run, BNY Mellon™s risk-based capital ratios have been 

calculated using risk-weighted assets determined 
under the Advanced Approach methodology. 
Summary of financial results We reported net income applicable to common 
shareholders of $2.5 billion or $2.15 per diluted 

common share in 2014, or $2.8 billion or $2.39 per 

diluted common share, adjusted for gains related to 
the sales of our equity investment in Wing Hang and 
the One Wall Street building, the benefit primarily 
related to a tax carryback claim, litigation and 
restructuring charges and the charge related to 

investment management funds, net of incentives. In 

2013, net income applicable to common shareholders totaled $2.0 billion, or $1.73 per diluted common 
share, or $2.7 billion, or $2.28 per diluted common 
share, adjusted for litigation and restructuring charges, the charge related to investment management 

funds, net of incentives, and the U.S. Tax Court™s 

decisions related to the disallowance of certain foreign tax credits. See ﬁSupplemental information -
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial 

measuresﬂ beginning on page 128 for the 

reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. 
Highlights of 2014 results 
ŁAUC/A totaled $28.5 trillion at Dec. 31, 2014 
compared with $27.6 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013.  

The increase of 3% primarily reflects higher 
market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger 

U.S. dollar, based on year-end rates.  (See the 

ﬁInvestment Services businessﬂ beginning on 
page 27). 
ŁAUM, excluding securities lending cash 
management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business, totaled a record $1.71 trillion at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with 

$1.58 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013.  The 8% increase 
resulted from higher equity market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable 
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, based on year-

end rates. (See the ﬁInvestment Management 

businessﬂ beginning on page 23). 
ŁInvestment services fees totaled $6.9 billion in 

2014, an increase of 2% compared with $6.8 

billion in 2013.  Higher asset servicing fees, 

reflecting organic growth, higher market values, 

higher collateral management fees in Global Collateral Services and net new business, as well as higher clearing services fees, primarily driven 
by higher mutual fund and asset-based fees, were 
partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees and 

lower corporate actions and dividend fees in Depositary Receipts. (See ﬁInvestment Services 
businessﬂ beginning on page 27). 
Ł Investment management and performance fees 
totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, a 3% increase 

compared with $3.4 billion in 2013.  The increase 
was primarily driven by higher equity market values, net new business and the favorable impact 
of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher 

money market fee waivers and lower 
performance fees. (See ﬁInvestment 
Management businessﬂ beginning on page 23). 
ŁForeign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $570 million in 2014 compared with $674 

million in 2013.  In 2014, foreign exchange 
 8 BNY Mellon 
               Results of Operations (continued) revenue totaled $578 million, a decrease of 5% 
compared with $608 million in 2013.  The 

decrease was driven by lower volatility, partially 
offset by higher volumes.  Total other trading was 
a net loss of $8 million in 2014, compared with 

with revenue of $66 million in 2013.  (See ﬁFee 

and other revenueﬂ beginning on page 11). 
ŁInvestment and other income totaled $1.2 billion 
in 2014 compared with $481 million in 2013.  
The increase primarily reflects the gains on the sales of our equity investment in Wing Hang and 

the One Wall Street building, partially offset by 

lower equity investment revenue. (See ﬁFee and 
other revenueﬂ beginning on page 11). 
ŁNet interest revenue totaled $2.9 billion in 2014 
compared with $3.0 billion in 2013 and net 

interest margin (FTE) was 0.97% in 2014 

compared with 1.13% in 2013.  Both decreases 
primarily resulted from lower yields, lower accretion, and the impact of interest rate hedging, 
partially offset by a change in the mix of assets 

and higher average interest-earning assets driven 
in part by higher deposits. (See ﬁNet interest 
revenueﬂ beginning on page 15). 
Ł The provision for credit losses was a credit of $48 
million in 2014 driven by the continued 

improvement in the credit quality of the loan 
portfolio. (See ﬁAsset quality and allowance for 
credit lossesﬂ beginning on page 50). 
ŁNoninterest expense totaled $12.2 billion in 2014 
compared with $11.3 billion in 2013.  The 

increase primarily reflects higher litigation 

expense and restructuring charges, partially offset 
by lower staff expense. Total noninterest expense 
excluding amortization of intangible assets, M&I, 
litigation and restructuring charges, and the 

charge related to investment management funds 

(Non-GAAP) decreased by $237 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting lower staff and business 
development expenses and a decrease in the cost 
of generating certain tax credits, partially offset 

by higher professional, legal and other purchased 
services. (See ﬁNoninterest expenseﬂ beginning 
on page 18). 
ŁThe provision for income taxes was $912 million 
(25.6% effective tax rate) in 2014 including a net 

benefit primarily related to litigation expense and 
the approval of a tax carryback claim, offset by 
the sales of our investment in Wing Hang and the 
One Wall Street building.  (See ﬁIncome taxesﬂ 

on page 19). 
Ł The net unrealized pre-tax gain on our total 
investment securities portfolio was $1.3 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $309 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  The increase was primarily driven 
by a decline in market interest rates. (See 

ﬁInvestment securitiesﬂ beginning on page 44). 
Ł Our estimated Basel III CET1 ratio (Non-GAAP) 
calculated under the Advanced Approach on a 
fully phased-in basis was 9.8% at Dec. 31, 2014 and 11.3% at Dec. 31, 2013.  The decrease was 

primarily driven by increases in estimated risk-
weighted assets which more than offset an 

increase in the estimated Basel III CET1 capital. Our estimated Basel III CET1 ratio (Non-GAAP) calculated under the Standardized Approach on a 

fully phased-in basis was 10.6% at both Dec. 31, 

2014 and Dec. 31, 2013. (See ﬁCapitalﬂ 
beginning on page 61). 
Results for 2013 In 2013 we reported net income applicable to common shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.0 billion, 

or $1.73 per diluted common share.  These results 

were primarily driven by: Ł Investment services fees totaled $6.8 billion in 
2013, an increase of 4% compared with $6.6 

billion in 2012.  The increase resulted from 

higher core asset servicing fees driven by organic 

growth and higher market values, higher clearing 
services fees and higher Depositary Receipts 
revenue, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust 

fees reflecting the continued run-off of high 

margin structured debt securitizations. 
Ł Investment management and performance fees totaled $3.4 billion in 2013, compared with $3.2 
billion in 2012.  The increase was driven by 

higher equity market values, net new business and the full-year impact of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Meriten Investment Management GmbH (ﬁMeritenﬂ), partially offset 
by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. 
dollar and higher money market fee waivers. Ł Foreign exchange and other trading revenue 
totaled $674 million in 2013, compared with 

$692 million in 2012.  In 2013, foreign exchange 

revenue increased 17%, driven by higher volumes 
and volatility.  Other trading revenue decreased in 

2013 reflecting lower fixed income trading 
revenue. BNY Mellon 9 
   Results of Operations (continued)Ł The provision for credit losses was a credit of $35 
million in 2013 and a credit of $80 million in 

2012.  The credit in 2013 was primarily driven by 

a broad improvement in the credit quality of the 
loan portfolio and a reduction in our qualitative 
allowance. Ł Noninterest expense totaled $11.3 billion in 2013, 

a decrease of $27 million compared with 2012, 

reflecting lower litigation expense, primarily 
offset by higher staff, software and our branding 

initiatives. Ł The provision for income taxes was $1.6 billion 
(42.1% effective tax rate) in 2013 including a 

15.7% net charge, or $593 million, resulting from 

the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions related to the 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits. Results for 2012 In 2012, we reported net income applicable to common shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.4 billion, 

or $2.03 per diluted common share.  These results 

were primarily driven by: Ł Investment services fees totaled $6.6 billion 
reflecting improved asset servicing revenue, 
driven by net new business and higher market 
values, as well as higher clearing and treasury 
services revenues, which was more than offset by 

the impact of the sale of the Shareowner Services 
business in the fourth quarter of 2011, lower 

Depositary Receipts revenue and lower Corporate 
Trust fees reflecting the continued run-off of high 

margin structured debt securitizations. 
Ł Investment management and performance fees 
totaled $3.2 billion reflecting higher market 

values, net new business and higher performance 
fees. Ł Foreign exchange and other trading revenue 
totaled $692 million reflecting lower foreign 

exchange revenue partially offset by improved 

fixed income trading revenue. Ł The provision for credit losses was a credit of $80 

million largely driven by a reduction in the 

allowance for credit losses related to the 
residential mortgage loan portfolio. Ł Noninterest expense totaled $11.3 billion 

reflecting higher litigation expense and the cost 
of generating certain tax credits, partially offset 

by the impact of the sale of Shareowner Services 
and the impact of our Operational Excellence

Fee and other revenue 
Fee and other revenue totaled $12.6 billion in 2014, 
an increase of 7% compared with $11.9 billion in 

2013.  The increase was primarily driven by higher 

investment and other income, asset servicing revenue 
and investment management revenue, partially offset 

by lower issuer services revenue and foreign 
exchange and other trading revenue. Investment services fees 
Investment services fees were impacted by the following compared with 2013: 
Ł Asset servicing fees increased 4% primarily 
reflecting organic growth, higher market values 

and net new business. Ł Clearing services fees increased 6% primarily 

driven by higher mutual fund and asset-based 
fees, partially offset by higher money market fee 

waivers. Ł Issuer services fees decreased 11% primarily 

reflecting lower Corporate Trust fees and lower 
corporate actions and dividend fees in Depositary 
Receipts. Ł Treasury services fees increased 2% primarily 

reflecting higher payment volumes. See the ﬁInvestment Services businessﬂ in ﬁReview of 
businessesﬂ for additional details. Investment management and performance fees 
Investment management and performance fees totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 3% compared 

with 2013.  The increase was primarily driven by 

higher equity market values, net new business and the 
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (primarily 
versus the British Pound), partially offset by higher 

money market fee waivers and lower performance 
fees. Performance fees were $115 million in 2014 

and $130 million in 2013. 
Total AUM for the Investment Management business 
was a record $1.7 trillion at Dec. 31, 2014, compared 

with $1.6 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013.  The increase 

primarily resulted from higher equity market values BNY Mellon 11 
  Results of Operations (continued)and net new business, partially offset by the 
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, based on

2013.  In 2014, foreign exchange revenue totaled 
$578 million, a decrease of 5% compared with $608 

million in 2013.  The decrease was driven by lower 

volatility, partially offset by higher volumes.  Total 

other trading loss was $8 million in 2014, compared 

to revenue of $66 million in 2013.  The decrease 

primarily reflects losses on hedging activities within 
one of the Investment Management boutiques and 
lower fixed income derivatives trading revenue due to 
exiting the derivatives sales and trading business. 
Foreign exchange revenue and fixed income trading 
revenue are reported in the Investment Services 
business and the Other segment. Equity/other trading 

revenue is primarily reported in the Other segment. Our foreign exchange trading generates revenues which are influenced by the volume of client 
transactions and the spread realized on these 
transactions. Revenues are impacted by market 

pressures which continue to be increasingly 
competitive. The level of volume and spreads is 

affected by market volatility, the level of cross-border 

assets held in custody for clients, the level and nature 
of underlying cross-border investments and other 
transactions undertaken by corporate and institutional clients. These revenues also depend on our ability to 

manage the risk associated with the currency 
transactions we execute. The majority of our foreign 

exchange trades are undertaken for our custody 
clients in transactions where BNY Mellon acts as 

principal, and not as an agent or broker.  As a 

principal, we earn a profit, if any, based on our ability 

to risk manage the aggregate foreign currency 
positions that we buy and sell on a daily basis. 
Generally speaking, custody clients enter into foreign 
exchange transactions in one of three ways: 
negotiated trading with BNY Mellon, BNY Mellon™s 
standing instruction programs
, or transactions with third-party foreign exchange providers
. Negotiated trading generally refers to orders entered by the client 
or the client™s investment manager, with all decisions 

related to the transaction, usually on a transaction-
specific basis, made by the client or its investment 
manager.  Such transactions may be initiated by 

(i)€contacting one of our sales desks to negotiate the 
rate for specific transactions, (ii)€using electronic 
trading platforms, or (iii)€electing other methods such 
as those pursuant to a benchmarking arrangement, in 
which pricing is determined by an objective market 
rate adjusted by a pre-negotiated spread. Our custody 

clients choose to use third-party foreign exchange 
providers
 other than BNY Mellon for a substantial 

majority of their U.S. dollar-equivalent volume 

foreign exchange transactions. The preponderance of 

the notional value of our trading volume with clients 
is in negotiated trading. Our 
standing instruction programs
, which includes an option called the Defined Spread Program that the Company 
introduced to clients in the first quarter of 2012, 
provides custody clients and their investment 
managers with an end-to-end solution that allows 
them to shift to BNY Mellon the cost, management 

and execution risk, often in small transactions or 
transactions in restricted and difficult to trade 

currencies. We incur substantial costs in supporting 

the global operational infrastructure required to 
administer the standing instruction programs; on a 
per-transaction basis, the costs associated with the 

standing instruction programs generally exceed the 
costs associated with negotiated trading. In response 

to competitive market pressures and client requests, 
we are continuing to develop standing instruction 
program products and services and making these new 
products and services available to our clients. In our 

historical standing instruction program, known as 
Session Range, we typically assigned a price derived 
from the daily pricing range for marketable-size 
foreign exchange transactions (generally more than  12 BNY Mellon 
     Results of Operations (continued) $1 million) executed between global financial institutions, known as the ﬁinterbank range.ﬂ Using 

the interbank range for the given day, we typically 

priced client purchases of currencies at or near the 
high end of this range and client sales of currencies at 
or near the low end of this range. In the first quarter 

of 2014, we upgraded our Session Range program. 
The upgrades include pricing pursuant to pre-defined 
rules and enhanced post-trade reporting, with 
transactions priced once per day generally within the 
interbank range of the day, and subject to application 

of a price collar, with price being specific to session, 

pricing location and currency pair.  A description of 

the pricing rules used in the upgraded Session Range 
program is set forth in the program™s disclosure 

documentation, which is available to clients and their 
investment managers. Separately, the standing 

instruction Defined Spread Program sets prices for 
transactions in each pricing cycle (several times a day 
in the case of developed market currencies) by adding 
a predetermined spread either to an objective market 
source for developed and certain emerging market 

currencies, or to a reference rate computed by BNY 
Mellon for other emerging market currencies.  A 

description of the pricing rules is set forth in the 
Defined Spread Program disclosure documentation, 
which is available to clients and their investment 
managers. A shift by custody clients from the standing 
instruction programs to other trading options 
combined with competitive market pressures on the 
foreign exchange business may negatively impact our 
foreign exchange revenue. For the year ended Dec. 

31, 2014, our total revenue for all types of foreign 
exchange trading transactions was $578 million, or 

approximately 4% of our total revenue, and 

approximately 35% of our foreign exchange revenue 
resulted from foreign exchange transactions 
undertaken through our standing instruction 
programs. We continue to invest in our foreign exchange trading 
and execution capabilities, which is leading towards 
enhanced client service and higher volumes. Distribution and servicing fees 
Distribution and servicing fee revenue earned from mutual funds are primarily based on average assets in 
the funds and the sales of funds that we manage or 
administer and are primarily reported in the include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of 
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share 
classes, the funds™ market values and money market 

fee waivers. The $7 million decrease in distribution and servicing 
fee revenue compared with 2013 primarily reflects an 

increase in money market fee waivers. The impact of 

distribution and servicing fees on income in any one 
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing 

expense paid to other financial intermediaries to 
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of 
mutual funds. Distribution and servicing expense is 

recorded as noninterest expense on the income 
statement. Financing-related fees 

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the Other segment, include capital markets fees, 
loan commitment fees and credit-related fees. 
Financing-related fees totaled $169 million in 2014 

and $172 million in 2013.

include real estate, loans and other asset dispositions. 
Expense reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint 
venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon 

on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. 
Transitional services agreements primarily relate to 

the Shareowner Services business, which was sold on 
Dec. 31, 2011.  Other income primarily includes 

foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), other 
investments and various miscellaneous revenues. The 

$731 million increase in investment and other income 

compared with 2013 primarily resulted from the gains 

on the sales of the equity investment in Wing Hang 

and the One Wall Street building, partially offset by 

lower equity investment revenue. Net securities gains 
Net securities gains totaled $91 million in 2014 
compared with $141 million in 2013.  The low 

interest rate environment in 2014 and 2013 created 
the opportunity for us to realize gains as we 
rebalanced and managed the duration risk of the 
investment securities portfolio. 2013 compared with 2012 
Fee and other revenue totaled $11.9 billion in 2013 
compared with $11.4 billion in 2012.  The increase 

primarily reflects higher investment management and 
performance fees, asset servicing revenue and 
clearing services revenue, partially offset by lower 

net securities gains, foreign exchange and other 
trading revenue and distribution and servicing fees. Investment services fees increased 4% compared with 
2012 reflecting higher core asset servicing fees driven 
by organic growth and higher market values, higher 

clearing services fees and higher Depositary Receipts 
revenue, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust 

fees reflecting the continued run-off of high margin 

structured debt securitizations. Investment management and performance fees increased 7% primarily reflecting higher equity 

market values, net new business and the full-year 
impact of the Meriten acquisition, partially offset by 

higher money market fee waivers and the unfavorable 
impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.  
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased 3%.  Foreign exchange revenue increased 
17% driven by higher volumes and volatility.  Other 

trading revenue decreased 62% due to lower 

derivatives trading revenue and a loss on trading 
securities driven by higher interest rates.  14 BNY Mellon

Net interest revenue totaled $2.9 billion in 2014, a 
decrease of $129 million compared to 2013 primarily 

resulting from lower yields, lower accretion and the 
impact of interest rate hedging. The decrease was 

partially offset by a change in the mix of assets and 

higher average interest-earning assets driven by 
higher deposits. The net interest margin (FTE) was 0.97% in 2014 
compared with 1.13% in 2013.  The decline in the net 

interest margin (FTE) reflects the factors noted 

above. Average interest-earning assets were $304 billion in 
2014 compared with $273 billion in 2013.  The 

increase was due in part to higher client deposits. 
Average total securities increased to $113 billion in 

2014, up from $108 billion billion in 2013, reflecting 

our strategy to increase our high quality liquid assets 
in the securities portfolio. Average loans increased to 

$54 billion in 2014, up from $48 billion in 2013, 

primarily driven by higher margin loans.  Average 

assets related to interest-bearing deposits with the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks increased to 
$87 billion in 2014, up from $67 billion in 2013, 

reflecting higher client deposits. In the second half of 2014, we reduced our interbank 
placement assets and increased our high quality liquid 
assets in the securities portfolio. In 2014, several of Europe™s central banks have cut 
key deposit interest rates below zero. BNY Mellon 

has charged and/or reserves the right to charge 

negative interest rates, where appropriate, based on 
currency, which partially offset the actions of the 

central banks. The impact of the continuing decline 

of European reinvestment rates may negatively 
impact our net interest revenue. 2013 compared with 2012 

Net interest revenue of $3.0 billion in 2013, an 
increase of $36 million compared with 2012, as a 

change in the mix of interest-earning assets, lower 
funding costs and higher average interest-earning 
assets driven by higher deposits were primarily offset 

by lower yields. The net interest margin (FTE) was 

1.13% in 2013 compared with 1.21% in 2012.  The 

decline in the net interest margin (FTE) primarily 

reflects the impact of lower market rates on higher 
interest-earning assets, partially offset by a change in 

the mix of earning assets. BNY Mellon 15

accounting guidance in 2014 related to our investments in qualified affordable housing projects (ASU 2014-01).  See Note 2 of the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (b) The charge related to investment management funds, net of incentives was $104 million in 2014, $12 million in 2013 and $16 million in 

2012. Total noninterest expense was $12.2 billion in 2014, 

an increase of 8% compared with $11.3 billion in 

2013. The increase primarily reflects higher litigation 

expense and restructuring charges, partially offset by 

lower staff expense. Excluding amortization of 

intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring 
charges and the charge related to investment 

management funds, net of incentives (Non-GAAP), 
noninterest expense decreased 2%, compared with 

2013 primarily reflecting lower staff and business 

development expenses and a decrease in the cost of 
generating certain tax credits, partially offset by 

higher professional, legal and other purchased 
services. We continue to invest in our compliance, risk and 
other control functions in light of increasing 
regulatory requirements. While our expenses remain 

high in those areas as a result of the need to hire 
additional staff and advisors and to enhance our 

technology platforms, we expect the rate of related expense growth to slow as new rules are 
implemented. Staff expense 
Given our mix of fee-based businesses, which are staffed with high-quality professionals, staff expense 

comprised of 55% of total noninterest expense in both 

2014 and 2013, excluding amortization of intangible 
assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges and 

the charge related to investment management funds, 

net of incentives. Staff expense consists of: 

Ł compensation expense, which includes: -salary expense, primarily driven by headcount; -the cost of temporary services and overtime; 
and -severance expense; Ł incentive expense, which includes:  18 BNY Mellon 
       Results of Operations (continued) -additional compensation earned under a wide range of sales commission and incentive plans 
designed to reward a combination of 
individual, business unit and corporate 
performance goals; as well as, -stock-based compensation expense; and Ł employee benefit expense, primarily medical 
benefits, payroll taxes, pension and other 
retirement benefits. Staff expense was $5.8 billion in 2014, a decrease of 

3% compared with 2013.  The decrease primarily 

reflects lower pension and incentive expenses, the 
benefit of replacing technology contractors with 
permanent staff and the impact of streamlining 

actions. Non-staff expense 
Non-staff expense includes certain expenses that vary 
with the levels of business activity and levels of 
expensed business investments, fixed infrastructure 
costs and expenses associated with corporate 
activities related to technology, compliance, legal, 

productivity initiatives and business development. Non-staff expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring 
charges, and the charge related to investment 

management funds, net of incentives (Non-GAAP), 
totaled $4.8 billion in 2014, a decrease of 2% 

compared with 2013.  The decrease primarily reflects 

lower business development expense and a decrease 
in the cost of generating certain tax credits, partially 
offset by higher professional, legal and other 

purchased services. The decrease in business 

development expenses resulted from discretionary 
expense control and the 2013 corporate branding 
campaign. The increase in professional, legal and 

other purchased services was driven by higher 
expenses related to the implementation of strategic 
platforms. In 2014, we incurred $1.1 billion of M&I, litigation 
and restructuring charges compared with $70 million 

in 2013. The increase primarily reflects higher 

litigation expense. In 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $177 
million, primarily reflecting severance expense 
related to streamlining actions. For additional 

information on restructuring charges, see Note 11 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2013 compared with 2012 
Total noninterest expense was $11.3 billion in 2013, a 
decrease of less than 1%, compared with 2012. The 

decrease primarily reflects lower litigation expense, 
partially offset by higher staff, software, business 

development, net of occupancy and consulting 
expenses. Excluding amortization of intangible 

assets, and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges 

and the charge related to investment management 

funds, net of incentives (Non-GAAP), noninterest 
expense increased 5% compared with 2012. 
Income taxes 
BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of 
$912 million (25.6% effective tax rate) in 2014 

including a net benefit primarily related to litigation 
expense and the approval of a tax carryback claim, 
offset by the sales of our investment in Wing Hang 

and the One Wall Street building.  The provision for 

income taxes was $1.6 billion (42.1% effective tax 

rate) in 2013 including a 15.7% net charge, or $593 

million, resulting from the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions 

related to the disallowance of certain foreign tax 
credits. The income tax provision was $842 million 

(25.1% effective tax rate) in 2012. 
In 2014, BNY Mellon adopted ASU 2014-01, 
ﬁAccounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable 

Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB 

Emerging Issues Task Forceﬂ.  See Note 2 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the 
impact of the retrospective application of this new 
accounting guidance. We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
25% to 27% in the first quarter of 2015. Review of businesses 
We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and service lines for 
our two principal businesses and the Other segment. Business accounting principles 
Our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the 
generally accepted accounting principles used for 
consolidated financial reporting. These measurement 

principles are designed so that reported results of the 
businesses will track their economic performance. BNY Mellon 19 
 Results of Operations (continued)For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, the primary types of revenue by business 
and how our businesses are presented and analyzed, 
see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Business results are subject to reclassification whenever organizational changes are made or when 

improvements are made in the measurement 
principles. On Sept. 27, 2013, Newton Management 

Limited, together with Newton Investment 
Management Limited, an investment boutique of 
BNY Mellon, sold Newton™s private client business.  

In 2014, we reclassified the results of Newton™s 

private client business from the Investment 
Management business to the Other segment. The 

reclassifications did not impact consolidated results. 
All prior periods have been restated. In addition, prior period consolidated and Other segment results for the years ended Dec. 31, 2013 and 
Dec. 31, 2012 have been restated to reflect the impact 
of the retrospective application of adopting new 
accounting guidance in 2014 related to our 
investments in qualified affordable housing projects 

(ASU 2014-01). See Note 2 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. The results of our businesses may be influenced by client activities that vary by quarter.  In the second 

quarter, we typically experience an increase in 

securities lending fees due to an increase in demand 
to borrow securities outside of the United States. In 

the third quarter, Depositary Receipts and related 

foreign exchange revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of client dividend payments paid in 
the quarter.  Also in the third quarter, volume-related 

fees may decline due to reduced client activity.  In the 

fourth quarter, we typically incur higher business 

development and marketing expenses. In our 

Investment Management business, performance fees 
are typically higher in the fourth quarter, as the fourth 

quarter represents the end of the measurement period 
for many of the performance fee-eligible 
relationships. The results of our businesses may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in 
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.  We are 

primarily impacted by activities denominated in the 
British pound and the Euro. On a consolidated basis 

and in our Investment Services business, we typically 
have more foreign currency denominated expenses 
than revenues. However, our Investment 

Management business typically has more foreign 
currency denominated revenues than expenses. As a 

result, currency fluctuations impact the Investment 
Management business more than the Investment 
Services business. However, currency fluctuations, in 

isolation, are not expected to significantly impact net 
income on a consolidated basis. Net securities gains (losses) are recorded in the Other segment. M&I expense is a corporate-level item and 

is recorded in the Other segment. Restructuring 

charges recorded in 2014 relate to corporate-level 

initiatives and were therefore recorded in the Other 
segment. In the fourth quarter of 2013, restructuring 

charges were recorded in the businesses.  Prior to the 

fourth quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

reported in the Other segment.  20 BNY Mellon

 24 BNY Mellon 
    Results of Operations (continued) The results of the Investment Management business are driven by the period-end, average level and mix 
of assets managed and the level of activity in client 
accounts. The overall level of AUM for a given 

period is determined by: Ł the beginning level of AUM; 
Ł the net flows of new assets during the period resulting from new business wins and existing 
client enrichments, reduced by the loss of clients 
and withdrawals; and Ł the impact of market price appreciation or 
depreciation, the impact of any acquisitions or 
divestitures and foreign exchange rates. The mix of AUM is determined principally by client 

asset allocation decisions among equities, fixed 
income, index, liability-driven investments and 
alternative investments. Managed equity assets typically generate higher percentage fees than liability-driven investments and 
fixed-income assets. Also, actively managed assets 

typically generate higher management fess than 
indexed or passively managed assets of the same 
type. Management fees are typically subject to fee schedules based on the overall level of assets 
managed for a single client or by individual asset 
class and style. This is most prevalent for 

institutional assets where amounts we manage for 
individual clients are typically large.  
A key driver of organic growth in investment 
management and performance fees is the amount of 
net new AUM flows.  Overall market conditions are 

also key drivers, with a significant long-term 
economic driver being growth of global financial 
assets. Performance fees are generally calculated as a percentage of a portfolio™s performance in excess of a 

benchmark index or a peer group™s performance.  
Net interest revenue is determined by loan and deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between 
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on 
loans and deposits. Expenses in this business are 

mainly driven by staffing costs, incentives and 

distribution and servicing expense. Review of financial results 
Investment management and performance fees are dependent on the overall level and mix of AUM and 


hundredth of one percent) charged for managing 

those assets. Assets under management were a record 

$1.7 trillion at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $1.6 

trillion at Dec. 31, 2013, an increase of 8%.  The 

increase resulted from higher equity market values 
and net new business, partially offset by the 

unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, based on 

year-end rates.  Net long-term inflows were $48 

billion in 2014 and benefited from liability-driven 

investments, alternative investments, index funds and 
other fixed income products. Net short-term outflows 

were $1 billion in 2014. 
Total revenue was $4.0 billion in 2014, an increase of 
2% compared with 2013.  The increase reflects higher 

investment management fees and net interest revenue, 
partially offset by lower other revenue, performance 

fees and distribution and servicing fees. Revenue generated in the Investment Management business included 45% from non-U.S. sources in both 
2014 and 2013. Investment management fees in the Investment Management business were $3.4 billion in 2014 

compared with $3.3 billion in 2013.  The increase 

primarily resulted from higher equity market values, 
net new business and the favorable impact of a 
weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher money 

market fee waivers. In 2014, 37% of investment management fees in the Investment Management business were generated 
from managed mutual fund fees. These fees are 

based on the daily average net assets of each fund and 
the management fee paid by that fund. Managed 

mutual fund fee revenue increased 3% in 2014 

compared with 2013.  The increase primarily reflects 

higher equity market values and net new business. Performance fees were $115 million in 2014 
compared with $130 million in 2013.  Performance 

across a range of strategies generated positive returns, 
which were partially offset with stronger than average 

performance fees generated in 2013. BNY Mellon 25 
     Results of Operations (continued)Distribution and servicing fees were $162 million in 
2014 compared with $172 million in 2013.  The 

decrease was due in part to higher money market fee 
waivers. Other fee revenue was $87 million in 2014 compared 
with $111 million in 2013.  The decrease primarily 

resulted from lower other trading revenue related to 
losses on hedging activities within a boutique and 
lower seed capital gains. Net interest revenue was $274 million in 2014 
compared with $260 million in 2013.  The increase 

primarily resulted from higher average loans and 
deposits. Average loans increased 13% in 2014 

compared with 2013, while average deposits 

increased 3% in 2014 compared with 2013. 
Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets and the charge related to investment 

management funds, net of incentives, was $2.9 billion 

in 2014 compared with $2.8 billion in 2013.  The 

increase primarily resulted from higher staff, business 

development and purchased services expenses 
resulting from investments in strategic initiatives as 
well as the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. 
dollar. 
2013 compared with 2012 
Income before taxes totaled $968 million in 2013 
compared with $896 million in 2012.  Income before 

taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets and 
the charge related to investment management funds, 

net of incentives, was $1.1 billion in 2013, up slightly 

compared with 2012. Fee and other revenue 

increased $204 million compared with 2012 primarily 
due to higher equity market values, net new business 
and the impact of the Meriten acquisition, partially 
offset by higher fee waivers and the unfavorable 

impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  Net interest revenue 

increased $46 million compared to 2012 primarily 
resulting from higher average loans and deposits. 
Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and the charge related to investment 

management funds, net of incentives, increased $226 
million compared to 2012, primarily reflecting higher 
incentive expense driven by improved results, the 
impact of the Meriten acquisition, investments in 
strategic initiatives and the annual employee merit 
increase.  26 BNY Mellon

   Results of Operations (continued)Business description Our Investment Services business provides global custody and related services, government clearing, 
global collateral services, corporate trust and 
depositary receipt and clearing services, as well as 
global payment/working capital solutions to global 
financial institutional clients. Our comprehensive suite of financial solutions includes: global custody, global fund services, 

securities lending, investment manager outsourcing, 
performance and risk analytics, alternative investment 
services, securities clearance, collateral management, 
corporate trust, American and global depositary 

receipt programs, cash management solutions, 
payment services, liquidity services and other linked 
revenues, principally foreign exchange, global 
clearing and execution, managed account services 
and global prime brokerage solutions. Our clients 

include corporations, public funds and government 
agencies, foundations and endowments; global 
financial institutions including banks, broker-dealers, 

asset managers, insurance companies and central 
banks; financial intermediaries and independent 
registered investment advisors; and hedge fund 
managers. We help our clients service their financial 

assets through a network of offices and service 

delivery centers in 35 countries across six continents. The results of this business are driven by a number of factors, which include: the level of transaction 
activity; the range of services provided, which may 
include custody, accounting, fund administration, 

daily valuations, performance measurement and risk 
analytics, securities lending, and investment manager 
back-office outsourcing; the number of accounts; and 

the market value of assets under custody and/or 
administration. Market interest rates impact both 

securities lending revenue and the earnings on client 
balances. Business expenses are driven by staff, 

technology investment, equipment and space required 
to support the services provided by the business and 
the cost of execution, clearance and custody of 
securities. We are one of the leading global securities servicing 
providers with $28.5 trillion of AUC/A at Dec. 31, 

2014.  We are the largest custodian for U.S. corporate 

and public pension plans and we service 54% of the 
top 50 endowments. We are a leading custodian in 

the UK and service 20% of UK pensions that require 
a custodian. Globalization tends to drive cross-border 
investment and capital flows, which increases the 
opportunity to provide solutions to our clients. The 

changing regulatory environment is also driving 
client demand for new solutions and services. BNY Mellon is a leader in both global and U.S. 
Government securities clearance. We settle securities 

transactions in over 100 markets, act as a clearing 

agent for 18 of the 22 primary dealers and handle 
most of the transactions cleared through the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York (by volume).  As more 

fully described below

party repo collateral with approximately $2.1 trillion 
globally.  We currently service approximately $1.4 

trillion of the $1.6 trillion tri-party repo market in the 
U.S. BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 

party repurchase, or repo, market and currently has 
approximately 85% of the market share of the U.S. 
tri-party repo market. BNY Mellon has reduced the amount of secured 
intraday credit it provides to dealers in connection 
with their tri-party repo trades in a number of ways, 
including limiting the collateral used to secure 
intraday credit to certain more liquid asset classes, 
reducing the amount of time during which we extend 
intraday credit, reducing the amount of credit 
provided in connection with processing collateral 
substitutions, introducing a functionality that enables 
us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades into new trades without 
extending credit, and requiring dealers to prefund 
their repayment obligations in connection with trades 
collateralized by Depository Trust Company sourced 

securities. This combination of measures, together 

with the technological enhancements put in place in 
2014, have practically eliminated (defined as a 90% 
reduction) intraday credit related to tri-party repo 
processing. Global Collateral Services serves broker-dealers and 
institutional investors facing expanding collateral 
management needs as a result of current and 
emerging regulatory and market requirements.  

Global Collateral Services brings together BNY 
Mellon™s global capabilities in segregating, 

optimizing, financing and transforming collateral on 
behalf of clients, including its market leading broker-

dealer collateral management, securities lending, 
collateral financing, liquidity and derivatives services 
teams.  28 BNY Mellon 
        Results of Operations (continued) In securities lending, we are one of the largest lenders 
of U.S. Treasury securities and depositary receipts 

and service a lending pool of approximately $3.1 
trillion in 33 markets. We serve as depositary for 1,279 sponsored American 
and global depositary receipt programs at Dec. 31, 

2014, acting in partnership with leading companies 
from 65 countries - an estimated 60% global market

to approximately 1,500 financial organizations 

globally by delivering dependable operational 
support; robust trading services; flexible technology; 
and an expansive array of investment solutions, 
practice management support and service excellence. Role of BNY Mellon, as a trustee, for mortgage-backed securitizations BNY Mellon acts as trustee and document custodian 
for certain mortgage-backed security (ﬁMBSﬂ) 
securitization trusts. The role of trustee for MBS 

securitizations is limited; our primary role as trustee 
is to calculate and distribute monthly bond payments 
to bondholders. As a document custodian, we hold 

the mortgage, note, and related documents provided 
to us by the loan originator or seller and provide 
periodic reporting to these parties. BNY Mellon, 

either as document custodian or trustee, does not 
receive mortgage underwriting files (the files that 
contain information related to the creditworthiness of 
the borrower). As trustee or custodian, we have no 

responsibility or liability for the quality of the 
portfolio; we are liable only for performance of our 
limited duties as described above and in the trust 
documents. BNY Mellon is indemnified by the 

servicers or directly from trust assets under the 
governing agreements. BNY Mellon may appear as 

the named plaintiff in legal actions brought by 

servicers in foreclosure and other related proceedings 
because the trustee is the nominee owner of the 
mortgage loans within the trusts. BNY Mellon also has been named as a defendant in 
legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that 
the trustee has expansive duties under the governing 
agreements, including to investigate and pursue 
claims against other parties to the MBS transaction.

Consolidated Financial Statements. Review of financial results 
AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2014 were $28.5 trillion, an 
increase of 3% from $27.6 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013.  

The increase was primarily driven by higher market 
values and net new business, partially offset by the 

unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, based on 

year-end rates.  AUC/A were comprised of 36% 

equity securities and 64% fixed income securities at 
both Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013. 
Income before taxes was $1.9 billion in 2014 
compared with $2.8 billion in 2013.  Income before 

taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets, 
was $2.1 billion in 2014 compared with $2.9 billion 

in 2013.  The decrease compared with 2013 

primarily reflects higher litigation expense, lower net 
interest revenue and lower Corporate Trust and 

Depositary Receipts revenue, partially offset by 

higher asset servicing revenue. Revenue generated in the Investment Services business included 36% from non-U.S. sources in 
2014 compared with 35% in 2013. 
Investment services fees were $6.8 billion in 2014, an 
increase of 2% compared with 2013, reflecting the 

following factors: Ł Asset servicing fees (global custody, broker-
dealer services and global collateral services) 
were $4.0 billion in 2014 compared with $3.8 

billion in 2013.  The increase primarily reflects 

organic growth, higher market values and net new 

business. Ł Clearing services fees were $1.33 billion in 2014 

compared with $1.26 billion in 2013.  The 

increase was primarily driven by higher mutual 
fund and asset-based fees, partially offset by 

higher money market fee waivers. Ł Issuer services fees (Corporate Trust and 

Depositary Receipts) were $966 million in 2014, 

compared with $1.09 billion in 2013.  The 

decrease primarily reflects lower customer 
reimbursements, and lower corporate actions and 
dividend fees in Depositary Receipts. Ł Treasury services fees were $555 million in 2014 

compared with $544 million in 2013.  The 

increase primarily reflects higher payment 
volumes. BNY Mellon 29 
         Results of Operations (continued)Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $627 million in 2014 compared with $693 million in 

2013.  The decrease primarily reflects lower 

volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. 

Net interest revenue was $2.3 billion in 2014 

compared with $2.5 billion
 in 2013.  The decrease 
primarily reflects lower yields and lower accretion, 
partially offset by higher average loans and deposits. 
Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased $741 million compared 

with 2013.  The increase primarily reflects higher 

litigation expense, and higher professional, legal and 
other purchased services expense primarily driven by 
increased expenses related to the implementation of 
strategic platforms, partially offset by lower staff 

expenses. 2013 compared with 2012 
Income before taxes totaled $2.8 billion in 2013 
compared with $2.2 billion in 2012.  Excluding 

intangible amortization, income before taxes was $2.9 

billion in 2013 compared with $2.4 billion in 2012
. Fee and other revenue increased $295 million 

reflecting higher asset servicing fees driven by 
organic growth and higher market values, higher 

clearing services fees, higher Depositary receipts 
revenue and, higher foreign exchange and other 
trading revenue driven by higher volumes and 
volatility, partially offset by lower securities lending 

revenue and Corporate Trust fees.  The $76 million 

increase in net interest revenue primarily reflects 
higher average loans and deposits. Noninterest 

expense (excluding intangible amortization) 
decreased $160 million primarily due to lower 

litigation expense, partially offset by higher staff, 

software and volume-driven expenses, and higher 
consulting expense driven by regulatory/compliance 
requirements and business initiatives in 2013.  30 BNY Mellon

Ł credit-related services; Ł the leasing portfolio; Ł corporate treasury activities, including our investment securities portfolio; Ł a 33.9% equity interest in ConvergEx; 
Ł business exits, including the results of Newton™s 

private client business in 2013 and 2012; and Ł corporate overhead. Revenue primarily reflects: Ł net interest revenue from the credit services and lease financing portfolios; Ł interest revenue remaining after transfer pricing 
allocations; Ł fee and other revenue from corporate and bank 
owned life insurance, credit-related financing 
revenue and Newton™s private client business; 

and Ł gains (losses) associated with the valuation of 
investment securities and other assets. Expenses include: Ł M&I expenses; Ł restructuring charges recorded in 2014 that relate 
to corporate-level initiatives and were therefore 
recorded in the Other segment. In the fourth 

quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

recorded in the businesses. Prior to the fourth 

quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

reported in the Other segment; Ł direct expenses supporting credit-related services, 
leasing, investing, and funding activities; and Ł certain corporate overhead not directly 
attributable to the operations of other businesses. Review of financial results 
The Other segment had pre-tax income of $643 
million in 2014 compared with pre-tax loss of $23 

million in 2013. 
Total fee and other revenue increased $625 million 
compared with 2013.  The increase primarily reflects 

the gains on the sales of our investment in Wing Hang 

and the One Wall Street building, partially offset by 

lower equity investment revenue, lower securities 
gains and the impact of the sale of Newton™s private 

client business. Net interest revenue increased $32 million compared 
with 2013.  The increase primarily reflects changes in 

the internal credit rates to the businesses for deposits 
in early 2013. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $48 
million in 2014 driven by the continued improvement 

in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Noninterest expense excluding M&I and restructuring charges decreased $139 million compared with 2013.  

The decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense, 

lower business development expense as a result of 
discretionary expense control and the 2013 corporate 
branding campaign, and a decrease in the cost of 
generating certain tax credits, partially offset by 

higher litigation expense. M&I and restructuring charges recorded in 2014 
primarily reflect severance expense related to 
streamlining actions. BNY Mellon 31 
        Results of Operations (continued)2013 compared with 2012 
The pre-tax loss totaled $23 million in 2013 
compared with a pre-tax income of $158 million in 

2012.  Total revenue decreased $187 million in 2013 

compared with 2012, which primarily reflects lower 

net interest revenue, lower fixed income trading 
revenue due to lower derivatives trading revenue and 
a loss on trading securities driven by higher interest 
rates, lower leasing and securities gains and lower 
foreign currency remeasurement, partially offset by 

higher equity investment revenue driven by a gain on 
the sale of a property.  Noninterest expense excluding 

amortization of intangible assets decreased $11 

million in 2013 compared with 2012.  The decrease 

primarily reflects a decrease in the cost of generating 
certain tax credits, partially offset by higher net 

occupancy expense, pension expense and higher 
business development expenses related to our 
corporate branding investment. International operations 
Our primary international activities consist of securities services and global payment services in our 
investment services business, and asset management 
in our investment management business. Our clients include some of the world™s largest asset 
managers, insurance companies, corporations, 
financial intermediaries, local authorities and pension 
funds. Through our global network of offices, we 

have developed a deep understanding of local 
requirements and cultural needs, and we pride 
ourselves in providing dedicated service through our 
multilingual sales, marketing and client service 
teams. We conduct business through subsidiaries, branches, 
and representative offices in 35 countries.  We have 

operational centers based in Brussels, Cork, Dublin, 
Wexford, Luxembourg, Singapore, Wroclaw, 

throughout the UK including London, Manchester, 

Brentwood, Edinburgh and Poole, and Chennai and 

Pune in India. At Dec. 31, 2014, we had approximately 9,000 
employees in EMEA, approximately 12,500 

employees in APAC and approximately 700 

employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil. BNY Mellon Investment Management operates on a 
multi-boutique model, bringing investors the skills of our specialist boutique asset managers, which 
together manage investments spanning virtually all 
asset classes. We are the seventh largest global asset manager and 
the second largest institutional manager in Europe.  

We are the market leader in the field of liability-

driven investments. At Dec. 31, 2014, our international operations managed 45% of BNY Mellon™s AUM compared with 

42%  at Dec. 31, 2013.  The increase primarily 

resulted from higher market values and net new 
business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 

a stronger U.S. dollar. 
In 2013, BNY Mellon CSD SA/NV received 
regulatory approval as a designated securities 
settlement system and issuer central securities 
depository based in Belgium. BNY Mellon CSD SA/ 

NV will help integrate and simplify settlement and 

safekeeping services across Europe for the benefit of 
our customers. In Europe, we maintain a significant presence in the Undertakings for Collective Investment in 
Transferable Securities Directives (ﬁUCITSﬂ) 

servicing field. In Ireland, BNY Mellon is one of the 

largest administrators (by total net assets) for fund 

administration services across domiciled and non-
domiciled funds. We offer a full range of tailored 

solutions for investment companies, financial 
institutions and institutional investors in Germany.  

We settle securities transactions in over 100 markets.  

We are a leader in servicing tri-party repo collateral 

with approximately $2.1 trillion globally. 
We serve as depositary for 1,279 sponsored American 
and global depositary receipt programs at Dec. 31, 

2014, acting in partnership with leading companies 
from 65 countries - an estimated 60% global market 
share. We have over 50 years of experience providing trade 
and cash services to financial institutions and central 
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a 

broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to 
financial institutions, corporations and central banks 
depending on the state of market development. In 

emerging markets, we lead with global payments and 

issuer services, introducing other products as the 
markets mature. For more established markets, our 

focus is on global, not local, investment services.  32 BNY Mellon 
         Results of Operations (continued) We are also a full-service global provider of foreign 
exchange services, actively trading in over 80 of the

rooms in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Revenue generated in the Investment Services business includes 36% from non-U.S. sources in 2014 

compared with 35% in 2013. 
Our financial results, as well as our level of AUM and 
AUC/A, are impacted by the translation of financial 
results denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. 
dollar.  We are primarily impacted by activities 

denominated in the British pound and the Euro. If the 

U.S. dollar depreciates against these currencies, the 
translation impact is a higher level of fee revenue, net 
interest revenue, noninterest expense and AUM and 

AUC/A. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, 

the translated levels of fee revenue, net interest 
revenue, noninterest expense and AUM and AUC/A 

will be lower.

In 2014, revenues from EMEA were $3.9 billion, 
compared with $3.8 billion in 2013 and $3.7 billion 

in 2012.  Revenues from EMEA were up 3% for 2014 

compared to 2013.  The increase in 2014 primarily 

reflects higher asset servicing revenue and Broker 
Dealer Services, partially offset by lower Depositary 

Receipts and Corporate Trust revenue.  Investment 

Services generated 63% and Investment Management 

generated 36% of EMEA revenues.  Net income from 

EMEA was $775 million in 2014 compared with 

$822 million in 2013 and $761 million in 2012.  
Revenues from APAC were $1.4 billion in 2014 
compared with $936 million in 2013 and $902 

million in 2012.  Revenues from APAC were up 48% 
for 2014 compared to 2013.  The increase in 2014 

primarily resulted from the gain on the sale of our 
investment in Wing Hang, higher asset servicing 

revenue and treasury services revenue, partially offset 

by lower investment management and performance 
fees. Revenue from APAC in 2014 was generated by 

Investment Services 49%, Investment Management 

14% and the Other segment 37%.  Net income from 
APAC was $719 million in 2014 compared with $399 

million in 2013 and $349 million in 2012.  
For additional information regarding our International operations, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, 
Russia and Ukraine We have provided expanded disclosure on countries 
that have experienced particular market focus on 
credit quality and are countries experiencing 
economic concerns. Where appropriate, we are 

offsetting the risk associated with the gross exposure 

in these countries with collateral that has been 
pledged, which primarily consists of cash or 
marketable securities, or by transferring the risk to a 
third-party guarantor in another country.  See ﬁRisk 

managementﬂ for additional information on how our 
exposures are managed. BNY Mellon has a limited economic interest in the 
performance of assets of consolidated investment 
management funds, and therefore they are excluded 
from this disclosure. The liabilities of consolidated 

investment management funds represent the interest 
of the noteholders of the funds and are solely 
dependent on the value of the assets of the funds. 
Any loss in the value of assets of consolidated 
investment management funds would be incurred by 
the fund™s noteholders.  
Our exposure in Ireland is principally related to Irish-domiciled investment funds. Servicing provided to 

these funds and fund families may result in overdraft 
exposure. Recent events in Russia and Ukraine significantly increased geopolitical tensions in Central and Eastern 
Europe. Recent declines in oil prices could also 

negatively impact companies located in that region. 
In addition to the exposures in the following table, we 
provide investments services, including acting as a 
depositary receipt bank, for companies in Russia, and BNY Mellon 33 
      Results of Operations (continued)investment management services primarily through our noncontrolling interest in an asset manager.  To 

date, our Russian-related businesses have not been 
materially impacted by the ongoing tensions, 
sanctions or impact of the decline in oil prices. 
Future developments including additional sanctions 
against Russian entities or a prolonged decrease in oil 
prices could adversely impact these businesses and 
our results of operations. At Dec. 31, 2014, our 

exposure to Ukraine was less than $1 million. At Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon 

had exposure of less than $1 million in both Portugal 
and Greece. The following tables present our on- and off-balance

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represent management™s estimate of probable losses inherent in 
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is 
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. We utilize a quantitative methodology and qualitative 
framework for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Within this qualitative framework, 
management applies judgment when assessing  36 BNY Mellon 
                    Results of Operations (continued) internal risk factors and environmental factors to compute an additional allowance for each component 
of the loan portfolio. The three elements of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments 
include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: Ł an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million or 
greater; Ł an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits; and Ł an allowance for residential mortgage loans. Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. 
As a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 

million. Therefore, the first element, impaired 

credits, is based on individual analysis of all impaired 
loans of $1 million or greater.  The allowance is 

measured by the difference between the recorded 

value of impaired loans and their impaired value. 
Impaired value is either the present value of the 
expected future cash flows from the borrower, the 

market value of the loan, or the fair value of the 
collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. The second element, higher risk-rated credits and pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 
model. Individual credit analyses are performed on 

such loans before being assigned a credit rating. All 

borrowers are assigned to pools based on their credit 
rating. The probable loss inherent in each loan in a 

pool incorporates the borrower's credit rating, loss 
given default rating and maturity.  The loss given 

default incorporates a recovery expectation and an 
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage 
given default). The borrower's probability of default 

is derived from the associated credit rating. Borrower 

ratings are reviewed at least annually and are 
periodically mapped to third-party databases, 
including rating agency and default and recovery 
databases, to ensure ongoing consistency and validity.  

Higher risk-rated credits are reviewed quarterly.  In 

the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the probable 
loss model to calculate the allowance for the Wealth 

Management mortgage portfolio which resulted in a 
$2 million increase in the allowance for this portfolio. 
In prior periods, the allowance was calculated using a 
delinquency pool approach as described below in the 
third element for the allowance for residential 
mortgage loans. The third element, the allowance for residential 
mortgage loans, is determined by segregating five 
mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging 
from current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 
default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. BNY Mellon assigns all 

residential mortgage pools, except home equity lines 
of credit, a probability of default and loss given 
default based on default and loss data derived from 
internal historical data related to our residential 
mortgage portfolio. The resulting probable loss 

factor (the probability of default multiplied by the 
loss given default) is applied against the loan balance 
to determine the allowance held for each pool. For 

home equity lines of credit, probability of default and 
loss given default are based on external data from 
third-party databases due to the small size of the 
portfolio and insufficient internal data. 
The qualitative framework is used to determine an additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 
factors below: Internal risk factors: Ł Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Ł Criticized assets to total loans and lending-related 
commitments; Ł Ratings volatility; Ł Borrower concentration; and Ł Significant concentration in high risk industries. Environmental risk factors: 
Ł U.S. non-investment grade default rate; Ł Unemployment rate; and Ł Change in real GDP. 
The objective of the qualitative framework is to 
capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 
captured in the quantitative reserve, which is based 
primarily on historical data. Management determines 

the qualitative allowance each period based on 
judgment informed by consideration of internal and 
external risk factors and other considerations that 
may be deemed relevant during the period. Once 

determined in the aggregate, our qualitative 
allowance is then allocated to each of our loan classes 
based on the respective classes™ quantitative 

allowance balances with the allocations adjusted, 
when necessary, for class specific risk factors.  
BNY Mellon 37 
   Results of Operations (continued)For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to 
evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 
The distribution of historical experience is compared 
to the risk factor™s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the 
portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 
relative to our historical experience. Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level - no impact, low, moderate, high and elevated - to each 

risk factor for the current quarter.  Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine 
an aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the 

impact of any particular risk factor.  Management™s 

assessment of the risk factors, as well as the trend in 
the quantitative allowance, supports management™s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 
allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 
reflected incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. A greater qualitative allowance 

may be required if our quantitative allowance does 
not yet reflect the incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or 
management™s judgment, the allowance for credit 

losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 
The credit rating assigned to each credit is a significant variable in determining the allowance. If 

each credit were rated one grade better, the allowance 

would have decreased by $83 million, while if each 
credit were rated one grade worse, the allowance 
would have increased by $251 million. Similarly, if 

the loss given default were one rating worse, the 
allowance would have increased by $33 million, 
while if the loss given default were one rating better, 

the allowance would have decreased by $29 million. 
For impaired credits, if the net carrying value of the 
loans was 10% higher or lower, the allowance would 

have decreased or increased by less than $1 million, 
respectively. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The guidance related to Fair Value Measurement 
included in ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a 
framework for measuring fair value, and expands 
disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value. The standard also established a three-level 

hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or 
liability as of the measurement date. Fair value - Securities 
Level 1 - Securities - Recent quoted prices from exchange transactions are used for debt and equity securities that are actively traded on exchanges and 
for U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government 

securities that are actively traded in highly liquid 
over-the-counter markets. 
Level 2 - Securities -For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine fair value primarily based on 
pricing sources with reasonable levels of price 
transparency.  The pricing sources employ financial 

models or obtain comparisons to similar instruments 
to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the type of transaction and apply such 
variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as 

observable transactions in the current market place 
and classify such securities as Level 2. In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 
securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 

observed trade price and other information feeds from 
the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 
information is included in the fair value assessment 
for such securities. The pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 
price. The pricing sources did not discontinue pricing 

for any securities in our investment securities 
portfolio at Dec. 31, 2014. 
We obtain prices for our Level 1 and Level 2 
securities from multiple pricing sources. We have 

designed controls to develop an understanding of the  38 BNY Mellon 
 Results of Operations (continued) pricing sources™ securities pricing methodology and 
have implemented specific internal controls over the 
valuation of securities. As appropriate, we review the quality control procedures and pricing methodologies used by the 
pricing sources, including the process for obtaining 
prices provided by the pricing sources, their valuation 
methodology and controls for each class of security. 
Prices received from pricing sources are subject to validation checks that help determine the 
completeness and accuracy of the prices. These 

validation checks are reviewed by management and, 
based on the results, may be subject to additional 
review and investigation. We also review securities 

with no price changes (stale prices) and securities 
with zero values. We have a surveillance process in place to monitor 
the accuracy of prices provided by the pricing 
sources. We utilize a hierarchy that compares 

security prices obtained from multiple pricing sources 
against established thresholds. Discrepancies that fall 

outside of these thresholds are challenged with the 
pricing services and adjusted if necessary.  
If further research is required, we review and validate these prices with the pricing sources. We also 

validate prices from pricing sources by comparing 
prices received to actual observed prices from actions 
such as purchases and sales, when possible. Level 3 - Securities -Where we have used our own cash flow models, which included a significant input into the model that was deemed unobservable, to 
estimate the value of securities, we classify them in 
Level 3 of the ASC 820 hierarchy.  More than 99% of 

our securities are valued by pricing sources with 
reasonable levels of price transparency.  Less than 1% 

of our securities are priced based on economic 
models and non-binding dealer quotes, and are 
included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our securities by ASC 820 

hierarchy level. Fair value - Derivative financial instruments 
Level 1 - Derivative financial instruments -Includes derivative financial instruments that are actively traded on exchanges, principally listed equity options. Level 2 - Derivative financial instruments -Includes the vast majority of our over-the-counter derivative 

financial instruments. Derivatives classified as Level 

2 are valued utilizing discounted cash flow analysis 
and financial models for which the valuation inputs 
are observable or can be corroborated, directly or 
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the 

instrument. Valuation inputs include interest rates, 

foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads, 
option volatilities and other factors. The valuation 

process takes into consideration factors such as 
counterparty credit quality, liquidity and 

concentration concerns. Level 2 over-the-counter 

derivatives generally include interest rate swaps and 
options, foreign exchanges forwards, foreign 
exchange swaps and options, forward rate 
agreements, equity swaps and options, and credit 
default swaps. Level 3 - Derivative financial instruments - Certain derivatives that are highly structured require significant judgment and analyses to adjust the value 
determined by standard pricing models. These 

derivatives are included in Level 3 of the ASC 820 

hierarchy and comprise less than 1% of our derivative 
financial instruments at fair value. To test the appropriateness of the valuations, we 
subject the models to review and approval by an 
independent internal risk management function, 
benchmark the models against similar instruments 
and validate model estimates to actual cash 
transactions. In addition, we perform detailed 

reviews and analyses of profit and loss. Valuation 

adjustments are determined and controlled by a 
function independent of the area initiating the risk 
position. As markets and products develop and the 

pricing for certain products becomes more 
transparent, we refine our valuation methods. Any 

changes to the valuation models are reviewed by 
management to ensure the changes are justified. To confirm that our valuation policies are consistent 
with exit prices as prescribed by ASC 820, observable 

inputs are utilized to determine pricing where 
available. In addition, where available, we review 

our derivative valuations using recent transactions in 
the marketplace, pricing services and the results of 
similar types of transactions. For details of our derivative financial instruments by level of the valuation hierarchy, see Note 20 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. BNY Mellon 39 
  Results of Operations (continued)Fair value option ASC 825 provides the option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement basis for selected financial 
assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm 
commitments and written loan commitments which 
are not subject to fair value under other accounting 
standards. Under ASC 825, fair value is used for both 

the initial and subsequent measurement of the 
designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with 
the changes in fair value recognized in income. See 

Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional disclosure regarding the fair 
value option. Fair value - Judgments 
In times of illiquid markets and financial stress, actual prices and valuations may significantly diverge 

from results predicted by models. In addition, other 

factors can affect our estimate of fair value, including 

market dislocations, incorrect model assumptions, 
and unexpected correlations. These valuation 

methods could expose us to materially different 

results should the models used or underlying 
assumptions be inaccurate. See ﬁSummary of 
significant accounting and reporting policiesﬂ in Note 
1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other-than-temporary impairment 

The guidance included in ASC 320 defines the OTTI 
model for investments in debt securities. Under this 

guidance, a debt security is considered impaired if its 
fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. An 

OTTI is triggered if (1) the intent is to sell the 
security; (2) the security will more likely than not 
have to be sold before the impairment is recovered, or 
(3) the amortized cost basis is not expected to be 
recovered. When an entity does not intend to sell the 

security before recovery of its cost basis, it will 
recognize the credit component of an OTTI of a debt 
security in earnings and the remaining portion in 
accumulated other comprehensive income. The determination of whether a credit loss exists is based on best estimates of the present value of cash 
flows to be collected from the debt security.  

Generally, cash flows are discounted at the effective 

interest rate implicit in the debt security at the time of 
acquisition. For debt securities that are beneficial 

interests in securitized financial assets and are not 
high credit quality, ASC 325 provides that cash flows 
be discounted at the current yield used to accrete the 
beneficial interest. For each security in the investment securities portfolio (including, but not limited to, those whose 
fair value is less than their amortized cost basis), an 
extensive, regular review is conducted to determine if 
an OTTI has occurred. For example, to determine if 

an unrealized loss on non-agency RMBS is other

than-temporary, we project total estimated defaults of 

the underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 
calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 
upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 
in order to determine the projected collateral loss. We 

also evaluate the current credit enhancement 
underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash 
flows. If we determine that a given non-agency 

RMBS will be subject to a write-down or loss, we 
record the expected credit loss as a charge to 

earnings. In recent years, improving home prices helped to stabilize the credit performance of non-agency RMBS 
transactions. This in turn enabled us to maintain 

generally stable assumptions for these transactions 
with regard to estimated defaults and the amount we 
expect to receive to cover the value of the loans 
underlying the securities. See Note 4 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for projected 
weighted-average default rates and loss severities at 
Dec. 31, 2014 and 2013 for the 2007, 2006 and 
late-2005 non-agency RMBS and the securities 
previously held in the Grantor Trust we established in 

connection with the restructuring of our investment 
securities portfolio in 2009. If actual delinquencies, 

default rates and loss severity assumptions worsen, 
we would expect additional impairment losses to be 
recorded in future periods. Net securities gains in 2014 were $91 million 
compared with $141 million in 2013.  The low 

interest rate environment in 2014 and 2013 created 
the opportunity for us to realize gains as we 
rebalanced and managed the duration risk of the 
investment securities portfolio. At Dec. 31, 2014, if we were to increase each of our projected loss severity and default rates by 100 basis 
points on each of the positions in our Alt-A, subprime 

and prime RMBS portfolios, including the securities 
previously held by the Grantor Trust, credit-related 

impairment charges on these securities would have 

increased by $4 million (pre-tax). If we were to 
 40 BNY Mellon 
    Results of Operations (continued) decrease each of our projected loss severity and default rates by 100 basis points on each of the 
positions, credit-related impairment charges on these 


tax). Goodwill and other intangibles 
We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired 
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in 
accordance with ASC 805 
Business Combinations. 
Goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other 
intangibles are subsequently accounted for in 
accordance with ASC 350 
Intangibles - Goodwill and 
Other. 
The initial measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires judgment concerning estimates of 
the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. 
Goodwill ($17.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2014) and 

indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.7 billion at Dec. 

31, 2014) are not amortized but subject to tests for 
impairment annually or more often if events or 
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not they 
may be impaired. Other intangible assets are 

amortized over their estimated useful lives and are 
subject to impairment if events or circumstances 
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying 
amount. BNY Mellon™s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment 
testing is done in accordance with ASC 350.  The 

Investment Management segment is comprised of two 
reporting units; the Investment Services segment is 
comprised of four reporting units; and one reporting 
unit is included in the Other segment. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step compares the estimated fair 

value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill 
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. 
However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit 

were to exceed its estimated fair value, a second step 
would be performed that would compare the implied 
fair value of the reporting unit™s goodwill with the 

carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment 

loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying 
amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. A 

substantial goodwill impairment charge would not 

have a significant impact on our financial condition, 
but could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, due to regulatory restrictions, 

the Company™s subsidiary banks could be restricted 

from distributing available cash to the Parent 
resulting in the Parent needing to issue additional 
long-term debt. In the second quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill test on all seven reporting units using 
an income approach to estimate the fair values of 
each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in the 

income approach were based on management™s 

projections as of April 1, 2014.  The discount rate 

applied to these cash flows ranged from 10.25% to 
12.0% and incorporated a 6.00% market equity risk 
premium. Estimated cash flows extend far into the 

future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate 

over such an extended time frame. As of the date of the annual test, the fair values of six of the Company™s reporting units were substantially 

in excess of the respective reporting units™ carrying 

value. The fair value of the Asset Management 

reporting unit, which is one of the two reporting units 
in the Investment Management segment, exceeded its 
carrying value by approximately 16%. The Asset 

Management reporting unit had $7.7 billion of 
allocated goodwill. For the Asset Management 

reporting unit, in the future, small changes in the 
assumptions could produce a non-cash goodwill 
impairment, which would have no effect on our 

regulatory capital ratios. In addition, certain money 

market fee waiver practices and changes in the level 
of assets under management could have an effect on 

Asset Management broadly, as well as the fair value 

of this reporting unit. Key judgments in accounting for intangibles include useful life and classification between goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangibles or other intangibles 
requiring amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair 
values, estimated using discounted cash flow 
analyses, to their carrying values. Other amortizing 

intangible assets ($1.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2014) are 

evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances 
indicate a possible impairment. Such evaluation of 

other intangible assets is initially based on 
undiscounted cash flow projections. See Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information BNY Mellon 41 
    Results of Operations (continued)regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual and interim impairment testing. Pension accounting 
BNY Mellon has defined benefit pension plans 
covering approximately 17,400 U.S. employees and 
approximately 12,200 non-U.S. employees. BNY Mellon has two qualified and several non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. 
and several pension plans overseas. As of Dec. 31, 

2014, the U.S. plans accounted for 79% of the 
projected benefit obligation. The pension expense for 

BNY Mellon plans was $68 million in 2014 

compared with $176 million in 2013 and $141 

million in 2012. 
On Jan. 29, 2015, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze benefit accruals under the U.S. 
qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans 
effective June 30, 2015.  This change will result in no 

additional benefits being earned by participants in 
those plans based on service or pay after June 30, 
2015. The plans were previously closed to new 

participants effective Dec. 31, 2010 at which time a 

non-elective contribution was added to the 
Company™s defined contribution plan for employees 

not eligible to join the pension plan. Employees 
currently participating in the pension plan will 
receive this non-elective contribution starting July 1, 
2015. A total net pension credit of $10 million is expected 
to be recorded by BNY Mellon in 2015, assuming 

currency exchange rates at Dec. 31, 2014.  The 

reduction in expense in 2015 is due to the amendment 
to the U.S. plans and includes a curtailment gain of 
$30 million that will be recognized in the first quarter 
of 2015. The reduction is partially offset by an 

increase in pension expense primarily driven by a 
decrease in the discount rate and updated mortality 
assumption for the U.S. plans. The reduction in 

pension costs for 2015 will also be partially offset by 

an increase in defined contribution plan costs of 
approximately $12 million. A number of key assumption and measurement date 
values determine pension expense. The key elements 

include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the 
discount rate, the market-related value of plan assets 
and the price used to value stock in the ESOP.  Since 

2012, these key elements have varied as follows: (dollars in millions,except per share

Consolidated Financial Statements. The discount rate for U.S. pension plans was 
determined after reviewing equivalent rates 
obtained by discounting the pension plans™ 
expected cash flows using various high-quality, 

long-term corporate bond yield curves. We also 

reviewed the results of several models that 
matched bonds to our pension cash flows. After 

reviewing the various indices and models, we 
selected a discount rate of 4.13% as of Dec. 31, 

2014.  As a result of the amendment to the U.S. 


measured as of Jan. 29, 2015 at a discount rate of 
3.73%. The discount rates for foreign pension plans are based on high-quality corporate bond rates in 
countries that have an active corporate bond 
market. In those countries with no active 

corporate bond market, discount rates are based 
on local government bond rates plus a credit 
spread. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated returns for each applicable 
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the 

expected allocation for each asset class and are based 
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and term historical returns for these markets. We also 

consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global 
economies, as well as current and prospective interest 
rates. The market-related value of plan assets also influences the level of pension expense. Differences 
 42 BNY Mellon 
   Results of Operations (continued) between expected and actual returns are recognized over five years to compute an actuarially derived 
market-related value of plan assets. The market-

related value of plan assets was $4,713 million as of 
the Jan. 29, 2015 re-measurement. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the future service period of active 
employees if they exceed a threshold amount. As of 

Dec. 31, 2014, BNY Mellon had $1.9 billion of 

unrecognized losses which are being amortized. As a 

result of the amendment to the U.S. pension plans 
described above, future unrecognized actuarial gains 
and losses for the U.S. plans that exceed a threshold 
amount will be amortized over the average future life 
expectancy of plan participants with a maximum of 
15 years. The annual impacts of hypothetical changes in the key assumptions on pension costs are shown in the

Retirement Plan of The Bank of New York Company, 

Inc. Consolidated balance sheet review At Dec. 31, 2014, total assets were $385 billion 
compared with $375 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  Total 

assets averaged $373 billion in 2014 compared with 

$342 billion in 2013.  Fluctuations in the period-end 

and average total assets were primarily driven by the level of client deposits and payables to customers and 
broker dealers. Deposits totaled $266 billion at Dec. 

31, 2014 and $261 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  Total 
deposits averaged $243 billion in 2014 and $226 billion in 2013. At Dec. 31, 2014, total interest-
bearing deposits were 51% of total interest-earning 
assets compared with 54% at Dec. 31, 2013.  
At Dec. 31, 2014, we had $40 billion of liquid funds 
and $103 billion of cash (including $97 billion of 
overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks) for a total of $143 billion of available 

funds. This compares with available funds of $155 
billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  The decrease in available 
funds primarily reflects our strategic effort to reduce 
our level of interbank deposits. Total available funds 
as a percentage of total assets was 37% at Dec. 31, 

2014 compared with 41% at Dec. 31, 2013.  Of the 
$40 billion in liquid funds held at Dec. 31, 2014, $19 
billion was placed in interest-bearing deposits with 
large, highly-rated global financial institutions with a 
weighted-average life to maturity of approximately 
22 days. Of the $19 billion, $3 billion was placed

total assets, at Dec. 31, 2014, compared with $99 

billion, or 26% of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2013.  The 
increase reflects a higher level of investments in U.S. Treasury securities, Agency RMBS, and sovereign

Private equity activities consist of investments in private equity funds, mezzanine financings, small business investment companies (ﬁSBICsﬂ) and direct equity investments. Consistent with our policy to 
focus on our core activities, we continue to reduce 
our exposure to private equity investments that are not compliant with the Volcker Rule.  The carrying 
and fair value of our private equity investments was $68 million at Dec. 31, 2014, a decrease of $18 
million from Dec. 31, 2013.  At Dec. 31, 2014, 

private equity investments consisted of investments in private equity funds of $28 million, Volcker
compliant SBICs of $18 million, direct equity of $15 
million, and leveraged bond funds of $7 million.  
Income on these investments was $6 million in 2014. 
At Dec. 31, 2014, we had $57 million of unfunded 
investment commitments to private equity funds, including $45 million to Volcker-complaint SBICs.  If

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $28.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $31.4 

billion€at Dec. 31, 2013.  The decrease primarily 

reflects lower exposure to banks driven by a lower 
level of trade finance loans. Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 
93% of the exposures meeting the investment grade 
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating 
classification at Dec. 31, 2014.  Each customer is 

assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to 
an equivalent external rating agency grade based 
upon a number of dimensions which are continually 
evaluated and may change over time. The exposure 

to financial institutions is generally short-term. Of 

these exposures, 72% expire within one year, and 

34% expire within 90 days.  In addition, 40% of the 

financial institutions exposure is secured. For 

example, securities industry and asset managers often 
borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 
For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, as a 
conservative measure, our internal credit rating is 
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the 
sovereign rating of the country where the 
counterparty resides regardless of the internal credit 
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying 
collateral. Our bank exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance and U.S. dollar-clearing businesses.  

These exposures are predominately to investment 
grade counterparties and are short term in nature. The asset manager portfolio exposures are high-quality with 99% of the exposures meeting our 

investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec. 

31, 2014.  These exposures are generally short-term 

liquidity facilities, with the vast majority to regulated

avoid single name/industry concentrations and our 
goal is to maintain a predominantly investment grade 
loan portfolio. The execution of our strategy has 

resulted in 93% of our financial institutions portfolio 
and 94% of our commercial portfolio rated as

Wealth management loans and mortgages 

Our wealth management exposure was $12.9 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $11.5 billion
 at Dec. 31, 2013.  The increase primarily reflects growth in 

the wealth management mortgage and loan portfolio. 
Wealth management loans and mortgages primarily 

consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which 
are secured by marketable securities and/or 
residential property.  Wealth management mortgages 

are primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages 
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 60% at 

origination. In the wealth management portfolio, less 
than 1% of the mortgages were past due at Dec. 31, 

2014. At Dec. 31, 2014, the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic 
concentrations: California - 22%; New York - 20%;  

Massachusetts - 15%; Florida - 8%; and other - 35%. 
Commercial real estate 

Our income producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are 
structured with moderate leverage based on existing 
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending 

activities also include construction and renovation 
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced 

developers and long-term holders of real estate assets. 
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or 
projected cash flows, and supported by appraisals and 
knowledge of local market conditions. Development 

loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in 
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the 
developer.  Our commercial real estate exposure 

totaled $5.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with 

$4.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013. 
At Dec. 31, 2014, 58% of our commercial real estate portfolio was secured. The secured portfolio is 

diverse by project type, with 60% secured by 

residential buildings, 20% secured by office 

buildings, 11% secured by retail properties, and 9% 

secured by other categories. Approximately 97% of 

the unsecured portfolio consists of real estate 
investment trusts (ﬁREITsﬂ), which are predominantly 

investment grade, and real estate operating 
companies. At Dec. 31, 2014, our commercial real estate portfolio consists of the following concentrations:  48 BNY Mellon 
   Results of Operations (continued) New York metro - 45%; REITs and real estate 
operating companies - 41%; and other - 14%. 
Lease financings 
The leasing portfolio exposure totaled $2.2 billion 
and included $146 million of airline exposures at 

Dec. 31, 2014, compared with $2.3 billion of leasing 

exposures, including $166 million of airline 

exposures, at Dec. 31, 2013.  At Dec. 31, 2014, 

approximately 87% of the leasing exposure was 

investment grade. At Dec. 31, 2014, the $2.1 billion non-airline lease 
financing portfolio consisted of exposures backed by 
well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket 

transportation equipment. The largest component is 

rail, consisting of both passenger and freight trains. 
Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with 
primary concentrations in the United States and 
Germany.  Approximately 48% of the non-airline 

portfolio is additionally secured by highly rated 
securities and/or letters of credit from investment 
grade issuers. Excluding airline lease financing, 

counterparty rating equivalents at Dec. 31, 2014, 

were as follows: Ł 50% of the counter parties were A, or equivalent; 
Ł 42% were BBB; and Ł 8% were non-investment grade. At Dec. 31, 2014, our $146 million of exposure to the 
airline industry consisted of $61 million to major U.S. 

carriers, $76 million to foreign airlines and $9 million 

to U.S. regional airlines. Our airline lease customers experienced a recent recovery in the industry that continued in 2014. 
However, a significant portion of these customers 

remain highly leveraged and vulnerable to economic 
downturns. We continue to closely monitor this 

portfolio. We utilize the lease financing portfolio as part of our 
tax management strategy. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 
totaled $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, compared with 

$1.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  Included in this 

portfolio at Dec. 31, 2014 are $350 million of 
mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 
quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 
mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  

As of Dec. 31, 2014, the purchased loans in this 
portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 
of 76% at origination and 18% of the serviced loan 

balance was at least 60 days delinquent. The 

properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage 

loans were located (in order of concentration) in 
California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New 

York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland. 
To determine the projected loss on the prime and Alt-
A mortgage portfolios, we calculate the total 

estimated defaults of these mortgages and multiply 
that amount by an estimate of realizable value upon 
sale in the marketplace (severity). Overdrafts 

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in 

the custody and securities clearance business and are 
generally repaid within two business days. Other loans 
Other loans primarily includes loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual 
funds and fixed income securities. Margin loans 

Margin loans are collateralized with marketable 
securities and borrowers are required to maintain a 
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value 

of the loan. Margin loans included $8.7 billion of 

loans at Dec. 31, 2014 and $6.7 billion at Dec. 31, 

2013 related to a term loan program that offers fully 

collateralized loans to broker-dealers. 
Tri-party repo committed credit facilities 

We are working to partially convert the secured 
intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with 
their tri-party repo trades from uncommitted credit to 
committed credit in the first quarter of 2015.€The 

dealers will be required to fully secure the 
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid 
assets having a market value in excess of the amount 
of the outstanding credit.€BNY Mellon 49

    Results of Operations (continued)The total allowance for credit losses was $280 million 
at Dec. 31, 2014, $344 million at Dec. 31, 2013 and 

$387 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  The ratio of the total 

allowance for credit losses to non-margin loans was 

0.72% at Dec. 31, 2014, 0.96% at Dec. 31, 2013 and 
1.16% at Dec. 31, 2012.  The ratio of the allowance 

for loan losses to non-margin loans was 0.49% at 

Dec. 31, 2014 compared with 0.58% at Dec. 31, 2013 

and 0.80% at Dec. 31, 2012.  The decrease in the total 

allowance for credit losses and the lower ratios at 
Dec. 31, 2014 compared with both prior periods 
primarily reflects an improvement in the credit 
quality in the loan portfolio. We had $20.0 billion of secured margin loans on our 
balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $15.7 

billion at Dec. 31, 2013 and $13.4 billion at Dec. 31, 

2012.  We have rarely suffered a loss on these types 

of loans and do not allocate any of our allowance for 
credit losses to them. As a result, we believe that the 

ratio of total allowance for credit losses as a 
percentage of non-margin loans is a more appropriate 

metric to measure the adequacy of the reserve. 
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit 
losses as discussed in ﬁCritical accounting estimatesﬂ and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for 
credit losses as follows: Allocation of allowance 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 
(a) Commercial 21% 24% 27% 18% 16% Commercial real estate 18 12 8 7 7 Foreign 16 16 12 12 11 Other residential mortgages 14 16 23 31 41 Lease financing 12 11 13 13 16 Financial institutions 11 14 9 13 2 Wealth management

inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
regardless of the nature of the loss. Nonperforming assets The following table shows the distribution of nonperforming assets at the end of each of the last five years.

million at Dec. 31, 2013.  The decrease primarily 

resulted from repayments of $15 million in the 
commercial loan portfolio, $4 million in the other 
residential mortgage loan portfolio and $2 million in 
the wealth management portfolio. Also in 2014, $14 

million of other residential mortgage loans returned

other residential mortgage loan portfolio and $4 
million in the foreign loan portfolio. Charge-offs in 

2014 were $3 million in the foreign loan portfolio, $2 
million in the other residential loans portfolio, $2 
million in the commercial real estate loan portfolio. 
The decrease was partially offset by additions of $26

portfolio and $5 million in the wealth management

an increase of 2% compared with $261.1 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2013.  The increase in deposits reflects 

higher levels of noninterest-bearing deposits driven 
by higher client deposits in our Investor Services 
business, partially offset by lower interest-bearing 

deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $104.3 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2014 compared with $95.4 billion at Dec. 

31, 2013.  Interest-bearing deposits were $161.6

at Dec. 31, 2013. The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign customers in domestic offices was $10.3 billion and

(up to one year) obligations. Liquidity risk is the risk 

that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral 

obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and 
unexpected cash flows, without adversely affecting 

daily operations or our financial condition. Liquidity 

risk can arise from cash flow mismatches, market 
constraints from the inability to convert assets to 
cash, inability to raise cash in the markets, deposit 
run-off, or contingent liquidity events.  Changes in 

economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, 
operational, legal, and reputational risks also can 
affect BNY Mellon™s liquidity risk profile and are 

considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional information on our liquidity policy, see 
ﬁRisk Management - Liquidity riskﬂ. Our overall approach to liquidity management is to ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 

amount and diversity such that changes in funding 
requirements at the Parent and at the various bank 
subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without 
material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 
or our financial condition. BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments 
and seeks to diversify funding sources by line of 
business, customer and market segment. Additionally, we seek to maintain liquidity ratios 
within approved limits and liquidity risk tolerance, 
maintain a liquid asset buffer that can be liquidated, 

financed and/or pledged as necessary, and control the 

levels and sources of wholesale funds. Moreover, 

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday 

liquidity risks, which are the risks that the firm cannot 
fund or settle obligations during the business day.  

Sources of intraday liquidity risks include timing 
mismatches of inflows and outflows, inability to hold 
or raise intraday cash, and unexpected market or 
idiosyncratic events. We monitor and manage 

intraday liquidity against existing and expected 
intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances, 
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday 

contingency funding, and available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet its obligations under 

normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions. Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of customer deposits and client drawdowns on unfunded 
credit or liquidity facilities. We actively monitor 

unfunded lending-related commitments, thereby 
reducing unanticipated funding requirements. When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics in order to have ample liquidity for expected 
and unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 

mismatches, asset maturities, debt spreads, peer 
ratios, liquid assets, unencumbered collateral, funding 
sources and balance sheet liquidity ratios. We also 

maintain various internal liquidity limits as part of 
our standard analysis to monitor depositor and market 
funding concentration, liability maturity profile and 
potential liquidity draws due to off-balance sheet 

exposure. Our performance with our internal 

liquidity limits demonstrates our strong ongoing 
liquidity. 
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires certain banking organizations, including BNY 

Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of 
unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net 

cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute 
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon. The following table presents the estimated consolidated HQLA as of Dec. 31, 2014. 
Estimated consolidated HQLA (in billions) Dec. 31, 2014 Securities (a) $ 97 Cash (b) 89 Total estimated consolidated HQLA $ 186 (a) Primarily includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, sovereign 
and U.S. GSE securities, investment-grade corporate debt and publicly traded common equity. 
(b) Primarily includes cash on deposit with central banks. Starting on Jan. 1, 2015, we and our domestic bank subsidiaries are required to meet an LCR of 80% 
calculated monthly for a six month period, after 
which the LCR must be calculated daily.  The 

required minimum LCR level will increase annually 
by 10% increments until Jan. 1, 2017, at which time, 
we will be required to meet an LCR of 100%. As of 

January 2015, based on our interpretation of the Final 
LCR Rule, we believe we and our domestic bank  56 BNY Mellon 
  €Results of Operations (continued) subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable LCR requirements on a phased-in basis. For additional 

information on the LCR, see ﬁSupervision and 
Regulation - Liquidity Standards - Basel III and U.S. 
Proposalsﬂ. We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 

under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are based 

on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under 
unlikely but plausible events. We perform these tests 

under various time horizons ranging from one day to 
one year in a base case, as well as supplemental tests 
to determine whether the Company™s liquidity is 

sufficient for severe market events and firm-specific 

events. Under our scenario testing program, the 

results of the tests indicate that the Company has 
sufficient liquidity. 
Beginning on Jan. 1, 2015, BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject 
to the Federal Reserve™s Enhanced Prudential 
Standards, which include liquidity standards, 
described under ﬁSupervision and Regulation -
Enhanced Prudential Standardsﬂ. BNY Mellon has 

taken actions to comply with various liquidity risk 
management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer 

of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the 
results of internal liquidity stress testing. We define available funds for internal liquidity 
management purposes as liquid funds (which include 
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds 
sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements), cash and due from banks, and interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other 
central banks. The table below presents our total 

available funds including liquid funds at period-end 
and on an average basis. The lower level of available 

funds at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with Dec. 31, 2013 

primarily resulted from our plan to reduce interbank 
placement assets with an increase in HQLA in our 

investment securities portfolio. Available and liquid funds (in millions) Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 2014 Average 2013 2012 Available funds: Liquid funds: Interest-bearing deposits with banks $ 19,495

sources of funds, such as money market rate 
accounts, federal funds purchased and securities sold 
under repurchase agreements, trading liabilities, 
commercial paper and other borrowings, were $30.0 

billion and $21.3 billion, respectively.  The increase 

primarily reflects higher levels of securities sold 
under repurchase agreements. Average foreign 

deposits, primarily from our European-based 
Investment Services business, were $109.4 billion for 

2014 compared with $101.3 billion for 2013.  The 

increase primarily reflects growth in client deposits. 
Domestic savings, interest-bearing demand and time 
deposits averaged $45.8 billion for 2014 compared 

with $45.2 billion for 2013.  The increase primarily 

reflects higher time deposits. Average payables to customers and broker-dealers 

were $9.5 billion for 2014 and $9.0 billion for 2013.  

Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven 

by customer trading activity and market volatility.  

Long-term debt averaged $20.6 billion for 2014 and 

$19.1 billion for 2013.  

term debt was driven by issuance of long-term debt in 
anticipation of upcoming debt maturities. Average 

noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $81.7 

billion for 2014 from $73.3 billion for 2013, 

reflecting growth in client deposits. A significant 

reduction in our Investment Services business would 
reduce our access to deposits. See ﬁAsset/liability 

managementﬂ for additional factors that could impact 
our deposit balances. BNY Mellon 57 
   €€€€  Results of Operations (continued)The Parent has four major sources of liquidity: Ł cash on hand; Ł dividends from its subsidiaries; Ł access to the commercial paper market; and Ł access to the debt and equity markets. Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2014, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 
approximately $2.0 billion, without the need for a 

regulatory waiver.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2014, non-

bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 
approximately $1.4 billion. 
In April 2014, BNY Mellon announced a 13% 
increase in our quarterly common stock dividend 
from $0.15 to $0.17 per common share. Our common 

stock dividend payout ratio was 31% for 2014, or 

25% after adjusting for increased litigation expense. 
The Federal Reserve™s current guidance provides that, 

for large bank holding companies like us, dividend 

payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income 

will receive particularly close scrutiny. 
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in 
ﬁSupervision and Regulation - Capital Planning and 
Stress Testing - Payment of Dividends, Stock 

Repurchases and Other Capital Distributionsﬂ and in 
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. In 2014 and 2013 the Parent™s average commercial 
paper borrowings were $2.5 billion and $690 million, 

respectively.  The Parent had cash of $7.4 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2014, compared with $6.8 billion at Dec. 31, 

2013.  In addition to issuing commercial paper for 
funding purposes, the Parent issued commercial 
paper, on an overnight basis, to certain custody clients 

with excess demand deposit balances. This overnight 

program was ended at the end of the third quarter of 
2014. There was no overnight commercial paper 

outstanding issued by the Parent at Dec. 31, 2014, 

and $96 million of overnight commercial paper was 

outstanding at Dec. 31, 2013.  Net of commercial 

paper outstanding, the Parent™s cash position at Dec. 

31, 2014, increased by $717 million compared with 

Dec. 31, 2013, primarily reflecting the issuance of 
senior medium-term notes and dividends received 
from subsidiaries, partially offset by maturities of 

long-term debt and common share repurchases. The Parent™s major uses of funds are payment of 

dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal 
and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions 
and additional investments in and loans to its 
subsidiaries. In 2014, we repurchased 46.2 million common shares 
at an average price of $36.13 per common share for a 

total cost of $1.7 billion 
The Parent™s liquidity policy is to have sufficient 
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents on hand to 
meet its forecasted debt redemptions, net interest 
payments and net tax payments over a minimum of 
the next 18 months without the need to receive 
dividends from its bank subsidiaries or issue debt. As 

of Dec. 31, 2014, the Parent was in compliance with 
its liquidity policy. 
Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit 
ratings, which, as of Dec. 31, 2014, were as follows: Credit ratings Moody™s S&P Fitch DBRS Parent: Long-term senior debt A1 A+ AA€(low) Subordinated debt A2 A A+ A (high) Preferred stock Baa2 BBB BBB A (low) Trust preferredsecurities A3 BBB BBB+ A (high) Short-term debt P1 A-1 F1+ R-1 (middle) Outlook - Parent: Stable Negative Stable Stable The Bank of New York Mellon:

and $19.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  In 2014, the Parent issued $4.7 billion of senior debt, partially 
offset by maturities of $4.3 billion. The Parent has 

$3.7 billion of long-term debt that will mature in 
2015. The following table presents the long-term debt issued by the Parent in 2014.

interest rate of 2.15% and $750 million of senior 
medium-term notes maturing in 2025 at an annual 
interest rate of 3.00%. The double leverage ratio is the ratio of investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated equity, 

which includes our noncumulative perpetual 
preferred stock plus trust preferred securities. Our 

double leverage ratio was 112.0% at Dec. 31, 2014 

and 109.4% at Dec. 31, 2013.  The double leverage 

ratio is monitored by regulators and rating agencies 
and is an important constraint on our ability to invest 
in our subsidiaries and expand our businesses. Pershing LLC, an indirect subsidiary of BNY Mellon, 
has uncommitted lines of credit in place for liquidity 
purposes which are guaranteed by the Parent. 
Pershing LLC has eight separate uncommitted lines 
of credit amounting to $1.5 billion in aggregate. Average daily borrowing under these lines was $4 

million, in aggregate, in 2014. 
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of 

credit amounting to $250 million in aggregate in 
place for liquidity purposes, which are guaranteed by 
the Parent. Average borrowings under these lines was 

$54 million, in aggregate, in 2014. 
Statement of cash flows 
Cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion 
in 2014 compared with $642 million used for 

operating activities in 2013 and $1.6 billion provided 

by operating activities in 2012. In 2014, cash flows 

from operations were principally the result of 
earnings and changes in trading activities, partially 
offset by changes in accruals and other balances.  In 

2013, cash flows used for operations were principally 
the result of changes in trading activities and 
accruals, partially offset by earnings.  In 2012, cash 

flows from operations were principally the result of 
earnings, partially offset by changes in trading 

activities. In 2014, cash used for investing activities was $11.7 
billion compared with $13.2 billion in 2013 and $29.4 

billion in 2012. In 2014, purchases of securities, 

changes in federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements and an increase in 
loans were significant uses of funds, partially offset 

by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities and 
decreases in deposits with banks and with the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks. In 2013, purchases 

of securities, changes in interest-bearing deposits 
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, 
loans and federal funds sold and securities purchased 
under resale agreements were a significant use of 
funds, partially offset by sales, paydowns and 

maturities of securities and a decrease in interest-
bearing deposits with banks. In 2012, purchases of 

securities, and increases in interest-bearing deposits 
with banks were significant uses of funds, partially 
offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities. 
In 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $7.8 billion compared with $15.6 billion in 2013 and 

$28.3 billion in 2012. In 2014, increases in payables 

to broker-dealers and the proceeds from the issuance 

of long-term debt were significant sources of funds, 
partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt 

and treasury stock repurchases. In 2013, an increase

Total The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 

shareholders™ equity at Dec. 31, 2014 decreased to 

$37.4 billion from $37.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  

The decrease primarily reflects share repurchases, a 
decrease in foreign currency translation adjustments 
and the impact of the increase in our pension benefit 
obligation, partially offset by earnings retention, 

approximately $650 million resulting from stock 
awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued 
for employee benefit plans, and an increase in the 
value of our investment securities portfolio. The unrealized gain net of tax on our investment securities portfolio recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income was $675 million at Dec. 31, 

2014, compared with $357 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  

The increase in the valuation of the investment securities portfolio reflects a decline in market 
interest rates. In 2014, we repurchased 46.2 million common shares 
at an average price of $36.13 per common share for a 

total cost of $1.67 billion.  We continued to 

repurchase shares in the first quarter of 2015 under 
the 2014 capital plan and expect to substantially 
complete our authorized repurchases of $425 million 

worth of common shares in the first quarter of 2015. On Jan. 23, 2015, The Bank of New York Mellon 
Corporation declared a quarterly common stock 
dividend of $0.17 per common share. This cash 

dividend was paid on Feb. 13, 2015 to shareholders 
of record as of the close of business on Feb. 3, 2015. BNY Mellon 61 
    Results of Operations (continued)BNY Mellon™s tangible common shareholders™ equity 
to tangible assets of operations ratio was 6.5% at Dec. 

31, 2014 and 6.8% at Dec. 31, 2013.  The decrease 

primarily reflects an increase in total assets and a 
lower level of cash on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks. Capital adequacy 
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon 

and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 
established quantitative measurements. For the 

Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding 
company, our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon 

must, among other things, qualify as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ. As of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon 
and our bank subsidiaries were considered ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ on the basis of the Tier 1 and Total 

capital to risk-weighted assets ratios and the leverage 
capital ratio (Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets 

as defined for regulatory purposes). The U.S. banking agencies™ capital rules have been 
based on guidance from the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision, as amended from time to time. 
For additional information on these capital 
requirements see ﬁSupervision and Regulation.ﬂ 
Prior to Jan. 1, 2014, BNY Mellon and our banking 

subsidiaries were subject to the capital requirements 
of Basel I (ﬁgeneral risk-based capital rulesﬂ) and 
Basel II.5. Effective Jan. 1, 2014, BNY Mellon 

became subject to Basel III under the Final Capital 
Rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a 
multi-year period through 2018. On Feb. 21, 2014, 

the Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had 

been approved to exit parallel run reporting for U.S. 
regulatory capital purposes related to the Final 
Capital Rules™Advanced Approaches, effective in the 

second quarter of 2014. In conjunction with the exit 

from parallel run, the risk-based capital adequacy of 
BNY Mellon and certain subsidiaries is determined 

using the higher of risk-weighted assets as calculated under the general risk-based guidelines (which for 
2014 looked to Basel I-based requirements and, 
commencing on Jan. 1, 2015, look to the Final 
Capital Rules™ new Standardized Approach), and 

under the Advanced Approach (ﬁthe Collins Floor 

comparisonﬂ). Our estimated Basel III CET1 ratios on a fully phased-in basis are based on our current 
interpretation, expectations and understanding of the 
Final Capital Rules. The estimated fully phased-in 

Basel III CET1 ratios assume all relevant regulatory 
model approvals. The Final Capital Rules require 

approval by banking regulators of certain models

these models are not approved, the estimated fully 
phased-in capital ratios would likely be adversely 
impacted. Risk-weighted assets at Dec. 31, 2014 

under the transitional Advanced Approach do not 

reflect the use of a simple V

style transactions (including agented indemnified 
securities lending transactions), eligible margin loans, 

and similar transactions. The Company has requested 

written approval to use this methodology.  The 

estimated net impact of such a VaR methodology for 

Dec. 31, 2014 regulatory capital ratios calculated 
under the transitional Advanced Approach would 

have been an increase of approximately 25 basis 
points to the CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios.  

The leverage capital ratio was not impacted. At Dec. 31, 2014, the CET1, Tier 1 and Total risk-
based regulatory capital ratios are based on Basel III 
components of capital, as phased-in, and asset risk-
weightings using the Advanced Approach framework.  

The transitional Standardized Approach CET1, Tier 1 

and Total risk-based consolidated regulatory capital 

ratios (which represent the Collins Floor comparison) 
were 15.0%, 16.3% and 16.9%, respectively, at Dec. 

31, 2014.  The leverage capital ratios for Dec. 31, 

2014 are based on Basel III components of capital 
and quarterly average total assets, as phased-in. The 

risk-based and leverage capital ratios for Dec. 31, 

2013 are based on Basel I rules (including Basel I

VaR methodology based on a Monte Carlo 

simulation, stop loss advisory triggers, and other 
market sensitivity measures. The calculation of our 

VaR used by management and presented below

consolidated investment management funds and seed capital 
investments. N/M - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different 
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to 

compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification 
effect. The interest rate component of VaR represents 

instruments whose values predominantly vary with 
the level or volatility of interest rates. These 

instruments include, but are not limited to: debt 
securities, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, 
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded 
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative 
products. The foreign exchange component of VaR represents 
instruments whose values predominantly vary with 
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or 
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not 

limited to: currency balances, spot and forward 
transactions, currency options, and exchange-traded 
futures and options, and other currency derivative 
products. The equity component of VaR is comprised of 
instruments that represent an ownership interest in the 
form of domestic and foreign common stock or other 
equity-linked instruments. These instruments 

include, but are not limited to: common stock, 
exchange-traded funds, Depositary Receipts, listed 
equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and 
other equity derivative products. The diversification component of VaR is the risk 
reduction benefit that occurs when combining 
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the 

correlated behavior of risk factor movements. During 2014, interest rate risk generated 72% of 
average VaR, equity risk generated 17% of average 

VaR and foreign exchange risk accounted for 11% of 

average VaR.  During 2014, our daily trading loss 

exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the overall

our trading revenue or loss fell within particular

       Results of Operations (continued)Under our mark-to-market methodology for derivative contracts, an initial ﬁrisk-neutralﬂ valuation 
is performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve.  In addition, 

we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of 
our derivatives. We reflect external credit ratings as well as 
observable credit default swap spreads for both 
ourselves as well as our counterparties when 
measuring the fair value of our derivative positions. 
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions 

is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit 
spreads, as well as those of our counterparties. In 

addition, in cases where a counterparty is deemed 
impaired, further analyses are performed to value 
such positions. At Dec. 31, 2014, our OTC derivative assets of $6.2 billion included a CVA deduction of $49 million.  Our 

OTC derivative liabilities of $7.2 billion included a 
DVA of $6 million related to our own credit spread.  
Net of hedges, the CVA decreased $8 million and the 

DVA increased $1 million in 2014.  The net impact of 

these adjustments increased foreign exchange and 
other trading revenue by $9 million in 2014. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, our OTC derivative assets of $4.2 billion included a CVA deduction of $26 million.  Our 

OTC derivative liabilities of $5.6 billion included a 
DVA of $9 million related to our own credit spread.  

Net of hedges, the CVA decreased $29 million and 

the DVA decreased $12 million in 2013.  The net 

impact of these adjustments increased foreign

Asset/liability management Our diversified business activities include processing securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, 
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets, and 
other transactions. The market risks from these 

activities are interest rate risk and foreign exchange 
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to 

movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain 
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage 

interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation 
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest 
rate exposures. An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. 
The model incorporates management™s assumptions 

regarding interest rates, balance changes on core 
deposits, market spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of 
derivative financial instruments used for interest rate 
risk management purposes. These assumptions have 

been developed through a combination of historical 
analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are 
inherently uncertain. As a result, the earnings 

simulation model cannot precisely estimate net 
interest revenue or the impact of higher or lower 
interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results 

may differ from projected results due to timing, 

magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and 
changes in market conditions and management™s 

strategies, among other factors. These scenarios do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact as 
interest rate expectations change. The table below

Long-term is equal to or greater than one year. 
The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes rates 
increase 25 basis points in each of the next four 
quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario 
assumes a 50 basis point per quarter increase. Our net interest revenue sensitivity table above incorporates assumptions about the impact of changes 
in interest rates on depositor behavior based on 
historical experience. Given the current historically 

low interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates 
could lead to higher depositor withdrawals than 
historically experienced. Growth or contraction of deposits could also be affected by the following factors: 
Ł Monetary policy; Ł Global economic uncertainty; Ł Our ratings relative to other financial institutions™ ratings; and Ł Money market mutual fund and other regulatory 
reform. Any of these events could change our assumptions 
about depositor behavior and have a significant 
impact on our balance sheet and net interest revenue. We also project future cash flows from our assets and 
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount 
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks 
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the 

structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of 

these discounted cash flows is the economic value of 
equity (ﬁEVEﬂ). The following table shows how the 

EVE would change in response to changes in interest 
rates: Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31, 2014 Rate change: up 200 bps vs. baseline(9.4)% up 100 bps vs. baseline(4.3)% During 2014, we modified our EVE computation 
methodology and no longer assign an implied equity 
duration in our calculations. At Dec. 31, 2014, using 

our previous methodology, we estimated a 2.7% 

decrease in EVE when interest rates increased 200 
basis points versus the baseline and a 1.1% decrease 
in EVE when interest rates increased 100 basis points 
versus the baseline. The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may 
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates 
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory 

capital, even though economically there may be no 
impact on our economic capital position. For 

example, an increase in rates will result in a decline 
in the value of our available-for-sale securities 

portfolio, which will be reflected through a reduction 
in accumulated other comprehensive income in our BNY Mellon 69 
 Results of Operations (continued)shareholders™ equity thereby affecting our tangible 
common equity (ﬁTCEﬂ) ratios. Under current 

accounting rules, to the extent the fair value option 
provided in ASC 825 is not applied, there is no 

corresponding change on our fixed liabilities, even 
though economically these liabilities are more 
valuable as rates rise. We project the impact of this change using the same 
interest rate shock assumptions described earlier and 
compare the projected mark-to-market on the 
investment securities portfolio at Dec. 31, 2014, 
under the higher rate environments versus a stable 
rate scenario. The table below shows the impact of a 

change in interest rates on the TCE ratio: 
Estimated changes in TCE ratio
Dec. 31, (in basis points) 2014 up 200 bps vs. baseline (97) up 100 bps vs. baseline (47) These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 
interest rate expectations change. To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign 
currency-denominated assets with liability 
instruments denominated in the same currency.  We 

utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability 
denominated in the same currency is not available or 
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of 
translation gains or losses created by investments in 
foreign markets. The foreign exchange risk related to 

the interest rate spread on foreign currency-
denominated asset/liability positions is managed as 
part of our trading activities. We use forward foreign 

exchange contracts to protect the value of our net 
investment in foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2014, 

net investments in foreign operations totaled $12 
billion and were spread across 12 foreign currencies.  70 BNY Mellon 
       Risk Management Risk management overview Governance 
Risk management and oversight begins with the Board of Directors and two key Board committees: 
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. 
The Risk Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and meets on a regular basis to 
review and assess the control processes with respect 
to the Company™s inherent risks.  They also review 

and assess the risk management activities of the 
Company and the Company™s fiduciary risk policies 

and activities. Policy formulation and day-to-day 

oversight of the Risk Management Framework is 
delegated to the Chief Risk Officer, who, together 

with the Chief Auditor and Chief Compliance Officer, 

helps ensure an effective risk management 

governance structure. The roles and responsibilities 

of the Risk Committee are described in more detail in 
its charter, a copy of which is available on our 

website, www.bnymellon.com
. The Audit Committee is also comprised entirely of 
independent directors, all of whom are financially 
literate within the meaning of the NYSE listing 
standards, and two of whom have been determined to 
be an audit committee financial expert as set out in 
the rules and regulations under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ﬁExchange 

Actﬂ), with accounting or related financial 
management expertise within the meaning of the 
NYSE listing standards. All members of the Audit 

Committee have been determined to have banking 
and financial management expertise within the 
meaning of the FDIC rules. The Audit Committee 

meets on a regular basis to perform an oversight 
review of the integrity of the financial statements and 
financial reporting process, compliance with legal 
and regulatory requirements, our independent 
registered public accountant™s qualifications and 

independence, and the performance of our registered 
public accountant and internal audit function. The 

Audit Committee also reviews management™s 

assessment of the adequacy of internal controls. The 

functions of the Audit Committee are described in 

more detail in its charter, a copy of which is available 

on our website, www.bnymellon.com
. The Senior Risk Management Committee (ﬁSRMCﬂ) is the most senior management body responsible for 
ensuring that emerging risks are weighed against the 
corporate risk appetite and that any material 
amendments to the risk appetite statement are 
properly vetted and recommended to the Executive 
Committee and the Board for approval. The SRMC 

also reviews any material breaches to our risk 
appetite and approves action plans required to 
remediate the issue. SRMC provides oversight for 

the risk management, compliance and ethics 
framework. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk 

Officer and Chief Financial Officer are among 

SRMC™s members. 
Risk appetite statement 
BNY Mellon defines risk appetite as the level of risk 
it is normally willing to accept while pursuing the 
interest of our major stakeholders, including our 
clients, shareholders, employees and regulators. The 

Company has adopted the following as its risk 
appetite statement: ﬁRisk-taking is a fundamental 

characteristic of providing financial services and 
arises in every transaction we undertake. Our risk 

appetite is driven by the fact our Company is the 
global leader in providing services that enable the 
management and servicing of financial assets in more 
than 100 markets worldwide and has been designated 
by international regulators as one of the 30 Global 
Systemically Important Financial Institutions (ﬁG-
SIFIsﬂ). This designation recognizes our fundamental 

importance to the health and operation of the global 
capital markets and carries with it a responsibility to 
maintain the highest standards of excellence. As a 

result, we are committed to maintaining a strong 
balance sheet throughout market cycles and to 
delivering operational excellence to meet the 
expectations of our major stakeholders, including our 
clients, shareholders, employees and regulators. The 

balance sheet will be characterized as liquid, with 
strong asset quality, ready access to external funding 

sources at competitive rates and a strong capital 
structure that supports our risk-taking activities and is 
adequate to absorb potential losses. These 

characteristics support our goal of having superior 
debt ratings among the best within our peer group, 
which comprises other trust and investment firms. To 

that end, the Company™s Risk Management 

Framework has been designed to: Ł ensure that appropriate risk tolerances (ﬁlimitsﬂ) are in place to govern our risk taking activities 
across all businesses and risk types; BNY Mellon 71 
      Risk Management (continued)Ł ensure that our risk appetite principles permeate the Company™s culture and are incorporated into 

our strategic decision-making processes; Ł ensure rigorous monitoring and reporting of key 
risk metrics to senior management and the Board 
of Directors; and Ł ensure that there is an on-going, and forward-
looking, capital planning process to support our 
risk taking activities.ﬂ Primary risk types The understanding, identification and management of risk are essential elements for the successful 
management of BNY Mellon.  Our primary risk 

categories are: Type of risk Description Operational/business The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, human factors and
systems, breaches of technology and
information systems, or from external events.
Also includes fiduciary risk, reputational risk,
and litigation risk. Market The risk of loss due to adverse changes in the
financial markets. Our market risks are 

primarily interest rate, foreign exchange, and
equity risk. Market risk particularly impacts

our exposures that are marked-to-market such
as the securities portfolio, trading book, and
equity investments. Credit The possible loss we would suffer if any of our 

borrowers or other counterparties were to
default on their obligations to us. Credit risk is 

resident in the majority of our assets, but
primarily concentrated in the loan and
securities books, as well as off-balance-sheet 

exposures such as lending commitments,
letters of credit, and securities lending
indemnifications. Liquidity The risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash 

and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost
for both expected and unexpected cash flows,
without adversely affecting daily operations or 

financial conditions. Liquidity risk can arise

from cash flow mismatches, market constraints 
from inability to convert assets to cash,
inability to raise cash in the markets, deposit
run-off, or contingent liquidity events. Thus, 

liquidity risk can be inherent in the majority of
our balance sheet exposures. The following table presents the primary types of risk typically embedded in on- and off-balance-sheet 

instruments. Risks of our on- and off-balance-sheet instruments Assets: Interest-bearing deposits withbanks credit Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements market, credit Securities market, credit Trading assets market, credit Loans credit Goodwill operational/business, market Intangible assets operational/business, market Liabilities: Deposits liquidity Federal funds purchased andsecurities sold under repurchase agreements liquidity Trading liabilities market, liquidity Payables to customers andbroker-dealers liquidity Commercial paper liquidity Off-balance-sheet instruments: Lending commitments credit, liquidity

            Risk Management (continued) The following chart provides a guide to the primary risks inherent in our businesses. Liquidity risk is 

managed on a stand-alone basis at the Consolidated 
and Bank levels. Management of liquidity risk is the 

responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Group which 

is reported in the Other segment. The percentages 

below are based on the allocation of economic capital 
at Dec. 31, 2014 to protect against unexpected 
economic losses over a one-year period at a level 
consistent with the solvency of a target debt rating. 
Operational/business risk Overview In providing a comprehensive array of products and services, we may be exposed to operational/business risk. Operational/business risk may result from, but 

is not limited to, errors related to transaction processing, breaches of internal control systems and compliance requirements, fraud by employees or persons outside BNY Mellon or business interruption 
due to system failures or other events. Operational/ 

business risk may also include breaches of our technology and information systems resulting from unauthorized access to confidential information or from internal or external threats, such as cyber attacks. Operational/business risk also includes 

potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and/or regulatory requirements. In the case of an operational 
event, we could suffer a financial loss as well as 
damage to our reputation. To address these risks, we maintain comprehensive 
policies and procedures and an internal control framework designed to provide a sound operational environment. These controls have been designed to 

manage operational/business risk at appropriate levels given our financial strength, the business 
environment and markets in which we operate, the nature of our businesses, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. Our internal auditors 
and internal control group monitor and test the overall effectiveness of our internal controls and financial 

reporting systems on an ongoing basis. We have also established procedures that are designed 
to ensure compliance with generally accepted conduct, ethics and business practices which are defined in our corporate policies. These include 
training programs such as for our ﬁCode of Conduct,ﬂ and ﬁKnow Your Customerﬂ programs, and 
compliance training programs such as those regarding information protection, suspicious activity reporting, 
and operational risk. Operational/business risk management 
We have established operational/business risk 
management as an independent risk discipline. The 
organizational framework for operational/business 
risk is based upon a strong risk culture that incorporates both governance and risk management activities comprising: 
Ł Board Oversight and Governance - The Risk 
Committee of the Board approves and oversees our operational/business risk management strategy in addition to credit and market risk. The 

Risk Committee meets regularly to review operational/business risk management initiatives, discuss key risk issues, and review the effectiveness of the risk management systems. 
Ł Accountability of Businesses - Business 
managers are responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls 
commensurate with their risk profiles and in accordance with BNY Mellon policies and 
procedures. Ł The Operational Risk Management Group is responsible for developing risk management policies and tools for assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing operational risk for BNY Mellon. The primary objectives of the 

Operational Risk Management Group are to promote effective risk management, identify 
emerging risks, create incentives for generating 
continuous improvement in controls, and to optimize capital. Ł The Information Risk Management Group is responsible for developing policies, methods and tools for identifying, assessing, measuring, BNY Mellon 73 
     Risk Management (continued)monitoring and governing information and technology risk for BNY Mellon.  The 
Information Risk Management Group partners with the businesses to help maintain and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
the firm™s information and technology assets from 

internal and external threats such as cyber attacks. Market risk In addition to the Risk Committee and SRMC, oversight of market risk is performed by certain committees and through executive review meetings. Detailed reviews of derivative trading positions and stress tests results are conducted during the Global 
Markets Weekly Risk Review.  Senior managers from 
Risk Management, Finance and Sales and Trading 
attend the review.  
Regarding the Treasury function, oversight is 
provided by the Treasury Risk Committee, bi-weekly 
Portfolio Management Group risk meetings, Business Risk meetings, and numerous portfolio reviews. Business Risk meetings for the Global Markets business also provide a forum for market risk oversight. The goal of Business Risk meetings, 
which are held at least quarterly, is to review key risk 
and control issues and related initiatives facing all lines of business including Global Markets. The 

following activities are also addressed during Business Risk meetings: Ł Reporting of all new Monitoring Limits and changes to existing limits; and Ł Monitoring of trading exposures, VaR, market 
sensitivities and stress testing results. The Global Markets Documentation Committee reviews and approves variations in the Company™s 

documentation standards as it relates to derivative transactions. In addition, this committee reviews all 
outstanding confirmations to identify potential exposure to the Company.  Finally, the Risk 
Quantification and Modeling Committee validates 
and reviews back-testing results for the Company™s 
VaR model. 
Credit risk To balance the value of our activities with the credit 
risk incurred in pursuing them, we set and monitor internal credit limits for activities that entail credit risk, most often on the size of the exposure and the 
maximum maturity of credit extended. For credit 
exposures driven by changing market rates and prices, exposure measures include an add-on for such potential changes. We manage credit risk at both the individual exposure 
level as well as the portfolio level.€Credit risk at the 
individual exposure level is managed through our credit approval system and involves four approval levels up to and including the Chief Risk Officer of 

the Company.  The requisite approvals are based upon 
the size and relative risk of the aggregate exposure under consideration.€The Credit Risk Group is 
responsible for approving the size, terms and maturity of all credit exposures as well as the ongoing 
monitoring of the creditworthiness of the counterparty.€ In addition, they are responsible for 
assigning and maintaining the risk ratings on each exposure. Credit risk management at the portfolio level is supported by the Basel & Capital Adequacy Group, 
within the Risk Management and Compliance Sector.  
The Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is responsible 
for calculating two fundamental credit measures. 
First, we project a statistically probable credit loss, used to help determine the appropriate loan loss reserve and to measure customer profitability.  Credit 
loss considers three basic components: the estimated 
size of the exposure whenever default might occur, 

the probability of default before maturity and the severity of the loss we would incur, commonly called 
ﬁloss given default.ﬂ For institutional lending, where 
most of our credit risk is created, unfunded commitments are assigned a usage given default 
percentage. Borrowers/Counterparties are assigned 
ratings by Credit Portfolio Managers (ﬁCPMsﬂ) and the Chief Credit Officer (ﬁCCOﬂ) on an 18-grade 
scale, which translate to a scaled probability of default. Additionally, transactions are assigned loss-

given-default ratings (on a 7-grade scale) that reflect the transactions™ structures including the effects of 
guarantees, collateral, and relative seniority of position. The second fundamental measurement of credit risk calculated by the Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is 
called economic capital. Our economic capital model 
estimates the capital required to support the overall credit risk portfolio. Using a Monte Carlo simulation 

engine and measures of correlation among borrower defaults, the economic model examines extreme and highly unlikely scenarios of portfolio credit loss in  74 BNY Mellon 
     Risk Management (continued) order to estimate credit-related capital, and then allocates that capital to individual borrowers and exposures. The credit-related capital calculation 
supports a second tier of policy standards and limits by serving as an input to both profitability analysis and concentration limits of capital at risk with any 
one borrower, industry or country. 
The Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is responsible 
for the calculation methodologies and the estimates of the inputs used in those methodologies for the 
determination of expected loss and economic capital. These methodologies and input estimates are regularly evaluated to ensure their appropriateness and accuracy.  As new techniques and data become 
available, Basel & Capital Adequacy attempts to 

incorporate, where appropriate, those techniques or data. Credit risk is intrinsic to much of the banking business. However, BNY Mellon seeks to limit both 

on- and off-balance sheet credit risk through prudent 
underwriting and the use of capital only where risk-adjusted returns warrant. We seek to manage risk and 
improve our portfolio diversification through syndications, asset sales, credit enhancements, credit 
derivatives, and active collateralization and netting agreements. In addition, we have a separate Credit 
Risk Review Group, which is part of Internal Audit, 
made up of experienced loan review officers who 
perform timely reviews of the loan files and credit 
ratings assigned to the loans. Liquidity risk 
Our overall approach to liquidity management is to ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 
amount and diversity such that changes in funding requirements at the Parent and at the various bank 
subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 
or our financial condition. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the liquidity risk of the Company and approves the liquidity risk tolerances. The Asset Liability 

Committee (ﬁALCOﬂ) is the senior management committee responsible for the oversight of liquidity management. ALCO is responsible to ensure that 
Board approved strategies, policies, and procedures for managing liquidity are appropriately executed. 
Senior management is also responsible for regularly reporting the liquidity position of the Company to the Board of Directors. The Treasury Risk Committee is 
responsible for reviewing liquidity stress tests and 
various liquidity metrics including contractual cash flow gaps for liquidity, liquidity stress metrics and 
ratios, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio and client deposit concentration. The Treasury 
Risk Committee approves and validates stress test 
methodologies and assumptions. BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments and seeks to diversify funding sources by line of 
business, customer and market segment. Additionally, we seek to maintain liquidity ratios 
within approved limits and liquidity risk tolerance, maintain a liquid asset buffer that can be liquidated, 
financed and/or pledged as necessary, and control the 

levels and sources of wholesale funds. Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of customer deposits and client drawdowns on unfunded credit or liquidity facilities. We actively monitor 

unfunded lending-related commitments, thereby reducing unanticipated funding requirements. When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics to ensure ample liquidity for expected and 
unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 
mismatches, asset maturities, debt spreads, peer ratios, liquid assets, unencumbered collateral, funding sources and balance sheet liquidity ratios. We 
monitor the LCR, as well as various internal liquidity 
limits as part of our standard analysis to monitor depositor and market funding concentration, liability maturity profile and potential liquidity draws due to off-balance sheet exposure.  Our performance with 
our internal liquidity limits demonstrates our strong 
ongoing liquidity. 
We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 
under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are based 

on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under unlikely but plausible events. The Company 
performs these tests under various time horizons ranging from one day to one year in a base case, as well as supplemental tests to determine whether the 
Company™s liquidity is sufficient for severe market 
events and firm-specific events. Under our scenario 
testing program, the results of the tests indicate that the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
BNY Mellon 75 
    Risk Management (continued)Stress Testing 
It is the policy of the Company to perform Enterprise-wide Stress Testing at regular intervals as part of its 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ﬁICAAPﬂ). Additionally, the Company performs an 
analysis of capital adequacy in a stressed 
environment in its Enterprise-Wide Stress Test 
Framework, as required by the enhanced prudential standards issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing performs analysis 
across the Company™s Lines of Business, products, 
geographic areas, and risk types incorporating the results from the different underlying models and 
projections given a certain stress-test scenario. It is 
an important component of assessing the adequacy of 
capital (as in the ICAAP) as well as identifying any high risk touch points in business activities. Furthermore, by integrating enterprise-wide stress testing into the Company™s capital planning process, 
the results provide a forward-looking evaluation of 
the ability to complete planned capital actions in a more-adverse-than-anticipated economic environment. Economic capital required BNY Mellon has implemented a methodology to 
quantify economic capital. We define economic 
capital as the capital required to protect against unexpected economic losses over a one-year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a target debt 
rating. We quantify economic capital requirements 
for the risks inherent in our business activities using statistical modeling techniques and then aggregate them at the consolidated level. A capital reduction, or 
diversification benefit, is applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss 
in each type of risk at the same time. Economic 
capital requirements are directly related to our risk profile. As such, they have become a part of our 
internal capital adequacy assessment process and, along with regulatory capital, are a key component to ensuring that the actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile and sufficient to 
provide the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. The framework and methodologies to quantify each of our risk types have been developed by the Basel & Capital Adequacy Group and are designed to be 
consistent with our risk management principles. The 
framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Due to the evolving nature of 

quantification techniques, we expect to continue to refine the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements. The following table presents our economic capital required at Dec. 31, 2014, on a consolidated basis. Economic capital required at Dec. 31, 2014 (in millions) Credit $ 4,489

(a) Includes interest rate risk, reputational risk and 
diversification benefit. Global compliance Our global compliance function provides leadership, guidance, and oversight to help our businesses identify applicable laws and regulations and implement effective measures to meet the specific 
requirements. Compliance takes a proactive 
approach by anticipating evolving regulatory 
standards and remaining aware of industry best practices, legislative initiatives, competitive issues, and public expectations and perceptions. The 
function uses its global reach to disseminate information about compliance-related matters 
throughout BNY Mellon.  The Chief Compliance and 
Ethics Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer, is a 
member of key committees of BNY Mellon and 
provides regular updates to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal audit Internal Audit is an independent, objective assurance 
function that reports directly to the Audit Committee 
of the Company™s Board of Directors.  It assists the 
Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing 
a systematic, disciplined, risk-based approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the 
Company™s risk management, control, and 
governance processes. The scope of Internal Audit™s 
work includes the review and evaluation of the 
adequacy, effectiveness, and sustainability of risk 
management procedures, internal control systems, information systems and governance processes.  76 BNY Mellon 
 Supervision and Regulation Evolving Regulatory Environment BNY Mellon, together with its subsidiaries, engages 
in banking, investment advisory and other financial 
activities in the U.S. and 35 other countries, and is 
subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates. Global supervisory authorities 

generally are charged with ensuring the safety and 

soundness of financial institutions, protecting the 
interests of customers, including depositors in 
banking entities and investors in mutual funds and 
other pooled vehicles, safeguarding the integrity of 
securities and other financial markets and promoting 
systemic resiliency and financial stability in the 
relevant country.  They are not, however, generally 

charged with protecting the interests of our 

shareholders or non-deposit creditors. This 

discussion outlines the material elements of selected 
laws and regulations applicable to us. Changes in 

these standards, or in their application, cannot be 
predicted, but may have a material effect on our 

businesses and results of operations. The financial services industry has been the subject of enhanced regulatory scrutiny in recent years globally, 

and we expect this trend to continue in the future. 
Our business has been subject to a significant number 
of new global reform measures. In particular, the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act of 2010 (the ﬁDodd-Frank Actﬂ) and 

its implementing regulations are significantly 
restructuring the financial regulatory regime in the 
United States and enhancing supervision and 
prudential standards for large BHCs like BNY 

Mellon. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for 

our businesses depend to a large extent on the manner 

in which its implementing regulations are established 
and interpreted by the primary U.S. financial 
regulatory agencies - the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, 
the OCC, the SEC and the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (the ﬁCFTCﬂ).  The 

implications are also dependent on changes in market 
practices and structures in response to the 
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial 

reforms in other jurisdictions. Although a large 

number of rules have been proposed and some have 
been finalized, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act 

remain subject to further rulemaking, take effect over 

various transition periods, or contain other elements 
that make it difficult to precisely anticipate their final 

impact. In addition, other national and global reform 

measures that have been adopted by various policy 
makers or are being considered may materially impact us. Relevant regulatory initiatives are 

discussed further below.  
Enhanced Prudential Standards 
Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act direct 
the Federal Reserve to enact heightened prudential 
standards and early remediation requirements 
applicable to BHCs with total consolidated assets of 
$50 billion or more, such as BNY Mellon, and certain 

designated nonbank financial companies (generally 
referred to as ﬁSIFIsﬂ). The Dodd-Frank Act 

mandates that the requirements applicable to SIFIs be 
more stringent than those applicable to other financial 
companies. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve 

issued for public comment a notice of proposed 
rulemaking, which we refer to as the ﬁProposed SIFI 
Rules,ﬂ establishing enhanced prudential standards 
for: Ł risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits; Ł liquidity requirements;Ł single-counterparty credit exposure limits;Ł stress testing of capital;Ł overall risk management requirements; and

Ł remedial actions that SIFIs must take during the 
early stages of financial distress if specified 
trigger events occur (referred to as the ﬁearly 
remediation provisionsﬂ). In addition, in the release accompanying the Proposed 
SIFI Rules, the Federal Reserve indicated it would 
consider whether to institute limits on short-term 
debt. The rules addressing stress testing of capital 

were finalized and effective commencing with the 

third quarter of 2013. In February 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted rules (ﬁFinal SIFI Rulesﬂ) to implement the liquidity and 
risk management requirements of the Proposed SIFI 
Rules. Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, the rules require 

BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated 
assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall 
risk management standards, including a buffer of 

highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs 
for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of 
directors in liquidity and overall risk management. 
The liquidity buffer is in addition to the U.S. banking 

agencies™ rules regarding the LCR, discussed below 

and described by the Federal Reserve as being 
ﬁcomplementaryﬂ to those liquidity standards. BNY Mellon 77 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued)counterparty credit limits or early remediation 
provisions.€The Federal Reserve noted that it is still 

developing the single-counterparty credit limit rule, 
and that, in finalizing that rule, it would take into 
account the Basel Committee™s framework for large 

exposure limits. The Basel Committee™s proposed framework for 
measuring and controlling large exposures was 

released in March 2013 and finalized by the Basel 
Committee in April 2014.  Once it becomes effective 

on Jan. 1, 2019, the final large exposures framework 

is expected to: Ł Limit exposures between a banking organization and a single counterparty or a 

group of connected counterparties to 25% of 
Tier 1 capital; 
Ł Limit exposures between G-SIBs to 15% of 
Tier 1 capital; 
Ł Exclude from the limit intraday interbank 
exposures and sovereign and central bank 
exposures; and Ł Allow banking organizations to use risk-

based capital measurements for securities 
financing transactions until the Basel 
Committee finalizes a revised exposure 
measurement methodology. 
The framework is conceptually analogous to the 
single-counterparty exposure limits in the Proposed 
SIFI Rules. It will become binding on U.S. banking 

organizations only to the extent that the U.S. 

banking agencies implement the framework, 
including through the Federal Reserve™s adoption of 

final single counterparty credit limits implementing 
section 165(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The Basel Committee™s large exposures framework 
does not specify a methodology to measure exposures 
from securities financing transactions (ﬁSFTsﬂ), such 

as securities lending and repurchase agreements. 
Instead, the Basel Committee expects to use the 
forthcoming revised comprehensive approach and 
supervisory haircuts or an equivalent method that 
does not rely on internal models-to measure SFT 
exposures. The Basel Committee expects to finish its 

review of this revised approach before the 2019 
deadline, but in the event of a delay, banks may 

continue to use the method they currently use to 
calculate their risk-based capital requirements for 
SFTs. 
Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other 
Capital Distributions The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries. 
Dividends and interest from its subsidiaries are the 
Parent™s principal sources of funds to make capital 

contributions or loans to its subsidiaries, to service its 
own debt, to honor its guarantees of debt issued by its 
subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a 
trust or to make its own capital distributions. Various 

federal and state statutes and regulations limit the 
amount of dividends that may be paid to the Parent by 
our bank subsidiaries without regulatory consent. If, 

in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory 
agency, a depository institution under its jurisdiction 

is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or 
unsound practice (which, depending on the financial 
condition of the bank, could include the payment of 
dividends), the regulator may require, after notice and 
hearing, that the bank cease and desist from such 
practice. The OCC, the Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC have indicated that the payment of dividends 
would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if 
the payment would reduce a depository institution™s 

capital to an inadequate level. Moreover, under the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the ﬁFDI 

Actﬂ), an insured depository institution may not pay 
any dividends if the institution is undercapitalized or 
if the payment of the dividend would cause the 
institution to become undercapitalized. In addition, 

the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued 
policy statements which provide that FDIC-insured 
depository institutions and their holding companies 
should generally pay dividends only out of their 
current operating earnings. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our U.S. banking subsidiaries is limited to the 
lesser of the amounts calculated under a ﬁrecent 
earningsﬂ test and an ﬁundivided profitsﬂ test. Under 

the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if 
the total of all dividends declared and paid by the 
entity in any calendar year exceeds the current year™s 

net income combined with the retained net income of 
the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains 
prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided 

profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of 
the entity™s ﬁundivided profitsﬂ (generally, 

accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as 
dividends or transferred to surplus). The ability of its

Supervision and Regulation (continued) bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent may also be affected by various minimum capital 

requirements for banking organizations.  
BNY Mellon™s capital distributions are subject to 
Federal Reserve oversight. The major component of 

that oversight is the Federal Reserve™s CCAR, 

implementing its capital plan rules. These rules 

require BHCs having $50 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets (including BNY Mellon) to 

submit annual capital plans to their respective Federal 
Reserve Bank. We are also required to collect and 

report certain related data on a quarterly basis to 
allow the Federal Reserve to monitor progress against 
the annual capital plans. BNY Mellon and other 

affected BHCs may pay dividends, repurchase stock, 

and make other capital distributions only in 
accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed 
by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal 
Reserve has not objected. The Federal Reserve may 

object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that 
the covered BHC will meet, for each quarter 
throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered 
by the capital plan, all minimum regulatory capital 
ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for 

that quarter and maintain a Tier 1 common to risk-

weighted assets ratio of at least 5% calculated under 
existing general risk-based capital rules as currently 
in effect, in each case on a 
pro forma
 basis under the base case and stressed scenarios (including a severely 
adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve). 
The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered 
BHC may not make a capital distribution unless after 
giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a Tier 

1 common to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 5%. The purpose of CCAR is to ensure that these BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning 
processes that account for their unique risks and that 
permit continued operations during times of 
economic and financial stress. The CCAR rule, 

consistent with prior Federal Reserve Board 
guidance, provides that capital plans contemplating 
dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of projected 
after-tax net income will receive particularly close 

scrutiny.  BNY Mellon™s common stock dividend 

payout ratio was 31% for 2014, or 25% after 

adjusting for litigation expense. In October 2014, the Federal Reserve revised aspects of its rules pertaining to CCAR and Dodd Frank Act 

stress tests (ﬁDFASTﬂ).  These revisions include, 
among other changes, proposals to limit the ability of 
a BHC subject to CCAR to make capital distributions 
in a given quarter if its actual capital issuances in that 
quarter are less than the amount indicated in its 
capital plan and to eliminate the need to obtain prior 
approval for accretive issuances of capital 
instruments that would qualify for inclusion in the 
numerator of regulatory capital ratios. In addition, 

these rules will revise the timeline for the submission 
of capital plans and stress tests for BHCs subject to 
CCAR. Under these rules, for the 2015 capital plan 

cycle, these BHCs were required to submit capital 
plans on or before Jan. 5, 2015, unchanged from prior 
years. For subsequent cycles, beginning in 2016, 

BHCs will be required to submit their capital plans 
and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve one 
quarter later (on or before April 5). 
In order to provide a transition to this timing, the Federal Reserve™s objection or non-objection to 

capital plans submitted in January 2015, including 
BNY Mellon™s, will cover a five-quarter period 

commencing with the second quarter of 2015 and 
extending through the second quarter of 2016. The 

objection or non-objection will switch to a four-

quarter period in years thereafter. 
We submitted our 2015 capital plan to the Federal 
Reserve on Jan. 5, 2015. The Federal Reserve has 

indicated that it expects to publish either its objection 
or non-objection to the capital plan and proposed 
capital actions, such as dividend payments and share 
repurchases, in March 2015. We anticipate 

announcing our 2015 capital plan shortly thereafter. 
Regulatory Stress-Testing Requirements 

In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements, Federal Reserve regulations also include DFAST, 

which was adopted in final form in October 2012. 
The CCAR and DFAST requirements substantially 

overlap, and the Federal Reserve implements them at 
the BHC level on a coordinated basis. Under these 

DFAST regulations, we are required to undergo 

regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal 
Reserve annually, and to conduct our own internal 

stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements twice 
annually.  In addition, The Bank of New York Mellon 

is required to conduct its own annual internal stress 
test (although this bank is permitted to combine 
certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test 
results with the results of BNY Mellon).  These 

requirements involve both company-run and BNY Mellon 79 
  Supervision and Regulation (continued)supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely 
adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate 
banking regulator.  Results from our annual company-

run stress tests are reported to the appropriate 
regulators and published. We published the results of 

our most recent company-run annual stress test on 
March 26, 2014, and the results of our company-run 
mid-year stress test on Sept. 15, 2014. Capital Requirements - Existing U.S. Requirements As a BHC, we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital rules administered by the Federal Reserve. 
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital 
requirements administered by the Federal Reserve in 
the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the 

OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, 
BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York 

Mellon Trust Company, National Association.  These 

requirements are intended to ensure that banking 
organizations have adequate capital given the risk 

levels of their assets and off-balance sheet exposures.  
The U.S. banking agencies™ capital rules historically 
have been based on three main components: Ł risk-based capital rules applicable to all banking organizations based on the Basel Committee™s 

1988 agreement, International Convergence of 
Capital and Measurement Standards
 (ﬁBasel Iﬂ). 
The U.S. banking agencies refer to these rules as 
the ﬁgeneral risk-based capital rulesﬂ. Ł risk-based capital rules applicable to banking 
organizations having $250 billion or more in total 

consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in 
foreign exposures (including BNY Mellon), 

based upon the advanced internal ratings-based 
approach for credit risk and the advanced 
measurement approach for operational risk based 
on the Basel Committee™s comprehensive June 

2006 release, International Convergence of 
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A 

Revised Framework (ﬁBasel IIﬂ). The agencies 
generally refer to these rules as modified by the 
Final Capital Rules, as the ﬁAdvanced 
Approachesﬂ risk-based capital rules. Ł a Tier 1 leverage ratio that measures Tier 1 capital 

to total assets. In addition, the risk-based capital rules incorporate a 
measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodity activities and in the trading of debt and 
equity instruments. The market risk-based capital 

rules require banking organizations with significant 

trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in 
an amount calculated by using the banking 
organizations™ own internal value-at-risk models, 

subject to parameters set by the regulators. General Risk-Based Capital Rules 
Under the agencies™ general risk-based capital rules 
based on Basel I, the risk-based capital ratio is 
determined by dividing the sum of the capital 
components (Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) by risk-

weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet 

items, such as standby letters of credit). Under these 

rules, the required minimum ratio of total capital (the 
sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) to risk-adjusted 

assets was 8.0%. The required minimum ratio of Tier 

1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 4.0%. These 

minimum required ratios were applicable to us 
through Dec. 31, 2013. The general risk-based capital rules based on Basel I provide that voting common shareholders™ equity 

should be the predominant element within Tier 1 

capital and that banks should avoid over-reliance on 

non-common equity elements. Risk-adjusted assets 

are determined by classifying assets and certain off-

balance sheet items into weighted categories. These 

rules are minimum standards based primarily on 
broad credit-risk considerations and do not take into 
account the other types of risk to which a banking 
organization may be exposed.  The federal banking 

agencies retain significant discretion to set higher 
capital requirements for categories of banks or for an 
individual bank as situations warrant. Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rules 

The U.S. banking agencies™Advanced Approaches 
risk-based capital rules are based on Basel II™s 

Advanced Approaches.  On Feb. 21, 2014, the 

Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had 

been approved to exit parallel run reporting for U.S. 
regulatory capital purposes effective starting in the 

second quarter of 2014, subject to ongoing 
qualification. We were required to comply with 

Advanced Approaches reporting and public 

disclosures commencing on June 30, 2014. Under the 

Final Capital Rules (as defined below), this means, 
among other things, for purposes of determining 
whether we meet minimum risk-based capital  80 BNY Mellon 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued) requirements, starting with the second quarter of 2014 our CET1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital 

ratio is the lower of that calculated under the general 
risk-based capital rules (during 2014 these ratios are 
determined using a Basel III numerator and Basel I 
risk-weightings) and under the Advanced Approaches 

rule. Capital Requirements -Basel III Final Capital Rules and Proposals 
In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies approved the Final Capital Rules. The Final Capital Rules are 

largely based on the Basel Committee™s December 

2010 final capital framework for strengthening 
international capital standards, now officially 

identified by the Basel Committee as ﬁBasel IIIﬂ, and 
also implement, through the new ﬁStandardized 
Approachﬂ discussed below, a revised calculation of 

risk-weighted assets that, effective Jan. 1, 2015, 

replaced the calculation of risk-weighted assets under 
the general risk-based capital rules based on Basel I. 
The Final Capital Rules, among other changes: Ł redefine the components of capital in the numerator of regulatory capital ratios in a more 
narrow way than the previous capital standards; Ł introduce a new minimum CET1 risk-based 
capital ratio and increase the minimum Tier1 risk-

based capital ratio under the general risk-based 
capital rules and the Advanced Approaches; 
Ł change the measure of risk-weighted assets in the 
denominator of the general risk-based capital 
rules according to the new ﬁStandardized 
Approach,ﬂ so that the Standardized Approach is 

the new ﬁgenerally applicable risk-based capitalﬂ 
standard; Ł change the measure of risk-weighted assets in the 
denominator of the risk-based capital ratios in the 
agencies™Advanced Approaches rules; 
Ł establish a capital conservation buffer; 
Ł introduce a countercyclical capital buffer for 

banking organizations subject to the Advanced 

Approaches (ﬁAdvanced Approaches banking 

organizationsﬂ); and 
Ł establish a supplementary leverage ratio for 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations. 
The Final Capital Rules allow a graduated 
implementation schedule that began on Jan. 1, 2014 
for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, 

including BNY Mellon, and will be substantially 

phased-in by 2019. The applicable transition periods 
for the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios, 
definitions of regulatory capital, and regulatory 
capital adjustments and deductions also began on Jan. 
1, 2014. In addition, BNY Mellon must: 
Ł begin using the new Standardized Approach risk-
weightings on Jan. 1, 2015. During 2014, the 

Final Capital Rules looked to Basel I™s risk-

weightings in lieu of its Standardized Approach; 
Ł meet the minimum ratios for the capital 
conservation buffer and countercyclical capital 

buffer during the transition period beginning on 

Jan. 1, 2016; and Ł begin compliance with the new Basel III-based 
supplementary leverage ratio on Jan. 1, 2018. New Minimum Capital Ratios and Capital Buffers Consistent with the terms of the Basel III Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Final Capital Rules  

require Advanced Approaches banking organizations 

to satisfy three minimum risk-based capital ratios 
using both the new Standardized Approach risk-

weightings on Jan. 1, 2015 (during 2014, the Final 
Capital Rules used the Basel I-based risk weightings 
in lieu of the Standardized Approach) and the 

Advanced Approach (for BNY Mellon, commencing 

with the second quarter of 2014): Ł a CET1 ratio of 4.0% as of Jan. 1, 2014, which was increased to 4.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2015; Ł a Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.5% on Jan. 1, 2014, 

which was increased to 6.0% beginning Jan. 1, 
2015; and Ł a Total capital ratio of 8.0% (unchanged from the 

earlier general risk-based capital rules). In addition, these minimum ratios will be 
supplemented by a new capital conservation buffer 

that phases in, beginning on Jan. 1, 2016, in 
increments of 0.625% per year until it reaches 2.5% 
on Jan. 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer can 

only be satisfied with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb 
losses during periods of economic stress and applies 
to all banking organizations.  Banking organizations 

with a CET1 ratio above the minimum but below the 
conservation buffer (or below the combined capital 

conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, 

when the latter is applied) will face constraints on 
dividends, equity repurchases and compensation 
based on the amount of the shortfall. BNY Mellon 81 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued)During periods of excessive growth the capital conservation buffer may be expanded up to an 

additional 2.5% through the imposition of a 
countercyclical capital buffer.  The countercyclical 

capital buffer, when applicable, applies only to 

Advanced Approaches banking organizations.  The 

countercyclical capital buffer is initially set to zero, 

but it could increase if the banking agencies 
determine that there is excessive credit in the markets 
that could lead to wide-spread market failure. The Final Capital Rules™ buffers are also expected 
to be supplemented by a risk-based capital 
surcharge on G-SIBs.  In December 2014, the 

Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (the ﬁProposed U.S. G-SIB Ruleﬂ) to 
establish risk-based capital surcharges for 

systemically important U.S. BHCs. The Proposed U.S. G-SIB Rule retains the surcharge calculation from the Basel G-SIB 

framework (which is referred to as ﬁmethod 1ﬂ). 
However, it introduces an additional calculation 

approach (which is referred to as ﬁmethod 2ﬂ) that 
uses a new indicator designed to address perceived 
risks of short-term wholesale funding. Under the 

Proposed U.S. G-SIB Rule, a G-SIB™s surcharge is 

determined by taking the higher of the G-SIB™s 

surcharge determined under the two methods. 
The capital surchar
SIB Rule would be implemented as an extension 
of the capital conservation buffer and can only be 

satisfied with CET1 capital. Consistent with the 

phase-in of the capital conservation buffer

SIB capital surcharge would be phased in 

beginning on Jan. 1, 2016 and become fully 
effective on Jan. 1, 2019. 
The Proposed U.S. G-SIB Rule, if adopted in its current form, would result in higher surcharges for 

certain U.S. G-SIBs than would the Basel G-SIB 
framework. BNY Mellon could be subject to a 

surcharge that is greater than the prior estimate of 

1.0% under the Basel G-SIB framework. At Dec. 31, 2014, calculated on a transitionally phased-in basis and under the Advanced Approaches, 

BNY Mellon™s CET1 ratio was 11.2%, the Tier 1 

capital ratio was 12.2%, the Total capital ratio was 

12.5% and its leverage ratio was 5.6%. 
At Dec. 31, 2014, our estimated fully phased-in CET 
1 ratio was 9.8% under the Advanced Approaches and 

10.6% under the Standardized Approach, based on 

our current interpretations, expectations and 
understanding of the Final Capital Rules and the final 
market risk rules. New Measure of Capital 

The Final Capital Rules, like Basel III, provide for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to 
CET1 capital. These include, for example, providing 

that unrealized gains and losses on all available for 
sale debt securities may not be filtered out for regulatory capital purposes, and the requirement that 
mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets 
dependent upon future taxable income and significant 
investments in non-consolidated financial entities be 
deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such 
category exceeds 10% of common equity Tier 1 or all 

such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of 
common equity Tier 1. 
The Final Capital Rules redefine regulatory capital elements resulting in, among other things, cumulative 
perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred 
instruments no longer qualifying as Tier 1 capital, 

subject to a phase-out schedule. Non-qualifying 

capital instruments, such as trust preferred securities, 
that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 

capital prior to May 19, 2010 (and that are also 
outstanding on the effective date of the final rule) 

may continue to be included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital 

up to the following percentages: calendar year 2014:€

50%; calendar year 2015:€25%; and calendar year 

2016 and later dates:€0%. Certain non-qualifying 

instruments no longer eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 

capital may still be included in Tier 2 capital over a 

gradual phase-out schedule terminating in 2022. At 

Dec. 31, 2014, BNY Mellon had $312 million of 

outstanding trust preferred securities. New Generally Applicable Risk-Based Capital Rules:  
Standardized Approach 
As discussed, the Final Capital Rules amend the agencies™ generally applicable risk-based capital 

rules, replacing the risk-weight categories used to 
calculate risk-weighted assets in the denominator of 
capital ratios with a broader array of risk weighting 
categories that are intended to be more risk sensitive, 
known as the ﬁStandardized Approach.ﬂ  The new 

risk-weights for the Standardized Approach generally 
 82 BNY Mellon 
  Supervision and Regulation (continued) range from 0% to 1,250% compared with the risk-weights of 0% to 100% in the Basel I-based rules. 
Higher risk-weights under the Standardized Approach 

apply to a variety of exposures, including certain 
securitization exposures, equity exposures, claims on 
securities firms and exposures to counterparties on 
over-the-counter derivatives.  Compared with the 

Basel I-based rules, the risk-weighting changes likely 
to have significance for BNY Mellon are the 

application of the collateral haircut approach to 
securities lending, the replacement of the 20% risk-
weight for banks with OECD country risk 
classification ratings, the increased risk-weights for 
securitizations, the removal of the 50% risk-weight 
cap on derivative transactions, application of 1,250% 
risk-weight to default fund contribution and the 
elimination of the 0% risk-weight for commitments 
of less than one year.  
Concerning securities finance transactions, including transactions in which we serve as agent and provide 
securities replacement indemnification to a securities 
lender, the Final Capital Rules do not permit a 

banking organization to use a simple VaR approach to 

calculate exposure amounts for repo-style 
transactions or to use internal models to calculate the 
exposure amount for the counterparty credit exposure 
for repo-style transactions under the Standardized 
Approach (although these methodologies are included 
in the Advanced Approaches).  Under the 

Standardized Approach, a banking organization may 

use a collateral haircut approach to recognize the 
credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral 
that secures a repo-style transaction, including an 
agented securities lending transaction, among other 
transactions.€To apply the collateral haircut approach, 

a banking organization must determine the exposure 

amount and the relevant risk weight for the 
counterparty or guarantor.€ Banking organizations 

may calculate market price volatility and foreign 
exchange volatility using their own internal estimates 
with prior written approval of their primary Federal 
supervisor. 
Leverage Ratios 
As noted above, the U.S. banking agencies historically have required banks to meet a minimum 
Tier 1 leverage ratio.  The Final Capital Rules retain 

this Tier 1 leverage ratio but now require a minimum 

4% ratio for all banking organizations (eliminating 

the exception for certain banking organization to 

maintain only a 3% minimum).€At Dec. 31, 2014, 
the Tier 1 leverage ratio for The Bank of New York 

Mellon Corporation was 5.6% and the Tier 1 leverage 

ratio for our primary banking subsidiary, The Bank of 

New York Mellon, was 5.2%. 
The Final Capital Rules also implement a new 3% Basel III-based SLR for Advanced Approaches 

banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to 

become effective Jan.€1, 2018.  Unlike the Tier 1 

leverage ratio, the SLR includes certain off-balance 

sheet exposures in the denominator, including the 

potential future credit exposure of derivative 
contracts and 10% of the notional amount of 
unconditionally cancelable commitments. Subsequent to the U.S. banking agencies™ adoption of 
the Final Capital Rules, the Basel Committee 
finalized (in January 2014) modifications to the Basel 
III SLR. Those modifications would adjust the SLR™s 

denominator (referred to as the ﬁexposure amountﬂ) 
by making changes to the calculation of the exposure 
amount attributable to certain derivatives exposures 
and certain securities financing transactions but 
would retain the minimum Tier 1 SLR requirement of 

3%. In September 2014, the U.S. federal banking 

agencies issued a final rule modifying the SLR 
denominator in the U.S. to align with the final Basel 
III changes to the SLR denominator. 
In April 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted an 
ﬁenhancedﬂ SLR for banking organizations with total 

consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or 
assets under custody of more than $10 trillion, as well 
as their depository institution subsidiaries. The 

enhanced SLR would apply to the eight U.S. banking 
organizations that have been identified as G-SIBs by 

the Financial Stability Board (including BNY 
Mellon) and their insured depository institution 
subsidiaries. The enhanced SLR requires BNY 

Mellon and other U.S. G-SIBs to maintain an SLR of 
greater than 5% (composed of the current minimum 
requirement of 3% plus a greater than 2% buffer) and 

requires bank subsidiaries of those bank holding 
companies to maintain a 6% SLR in order to qualify 
as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under the prompt corrective 
action regulations discussed below.  The final 

enhanced SLR rule for U.S. G-SIBs, like the SLR 
more generally applicable to all Advanced 

Approaches banking organizations, will become 

effective on Jan. 1, 2018. 
BNY Mellon 83 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued)Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Proposal 
In November 2014, the Financial Stability Board issued a consultative document (ﬁTLAC Proposalﬂ) 
regarding a proposal to institute a Total Loss-

Absorbing Capacity (ﬁTLACﬂ) requirement on G-
SIBs. The TLAC Proposal would be effective no 

earlier than Jan. 1, 2019. Some key features of the 

TLAC Proposal include: Ł The TLAC Proposal would set an external TLAC 
risk-based ratio requirement within the range of 
16% to 20% of risk-weighted assets, and at a 
minimum twice relevant the Basel III SLR 
requirement. Regulatory buffers are expected to 

be additive to these levels. Ł Instruments eligible for external TLAC would 

generally include long-term senior unsecured 
debt instruments, as well as regulatory capital 
instruments. However, eligible TLAC that are 

not regulatory capital instruments must account 
for at least 33% of the minimum TLAC 

requirement. Ł G-SIBs subject to the TLAC requirement, 

including BNY Mellon, would also be required to 

maintain a minimum amount of internal TLAC at 

certain material foreign subsidiaries. Under the 

TLAC Proposal, these material foreign 
subsidiaries would be required to maintain 
internal TLAC equal to 75%-90% of the 

minimum external TLAC requirement that would 

apply to it if it were a stand-alone resolution 
entity.  
The U.S. banking agencies have not acted on this 
proposal. Prompt Corrective Action 

The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 

(ﬁFDICIAﬂ), requires the federal banking agencies to 
take ﬁprompt corrective actionﬂ in respect of 
depository institutions that do not meet specified 
capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital 

categories for FDIC-insured banks: ﬁwell 
capitalized,ﬂ ﬁadequately capitalized,ﬂ 
ﬁundercapitalized,ﬂ ﬁsignificantly undercapitalized,ﬂ 
and ﬁcritically undercapitalized.ﬂ The FDI Act 

imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on 
operations, management and capital distributions the 
less capital the institution holds. Prior to Jan. 1, 2015, a depository institution was 
deemed to be ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ if the depository 
institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at 
least 10.0%; Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 

6.0%; and Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%.  

FDICIA™s prompt corrective action provisions only 

apply to depository institutions and not to BHCs. The 

Federal Reserve™s regulations applicable to BHCs 

separately define ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ for BHCs to 
require maintaining a total risk-based capital ratio of 
at least 10.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 

at least 6.0% (but not a leverage measure). A BHC 

that is not well capitalized and well managed (or 
whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and 
well managed under applicable prompt corrective 
action standards) may not become a financial holding 
company or, if it is already a financial holding 

company but fails to maintain well-capitalized status, 
may be restricted in certain of its activities and 
ultimately may lose financial holding company status. 
Applicable capital rules do not apply a CET1 or 
leverage capital standard for determining whether a 
BHC is well capitalized. Effective Jan. 1, 2015, the Final Capital Rules 
establish revised ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ thresholds for 
insured depository institutions under the federal 
banking agencies™ prompt corrective action 

framework. Under the Final Capital Rules, an 

insured depository institution is deemed to be ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ if it has: Ł a CET1 of at least 6.5%; Ł a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%; 
Ł a Total capital ratio of at least 10%; and 
Ł a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. 
Effective January 2018, the Final Capital Rules also 
require an Advanced Approaches banking 

organization to maintain a SLR of at least 3% to 

qualify for the ﬁadequately capitalizedﬂ status. In addition, as noted above, the U.S. federal banking agencies™ revisions to the enhanced SLR establish a 

SLR ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ threshold of 6% for covered 
insured depository institutions, including The Bank of 

New York Mellon and BNY Mellon N.A. 
At Dec. 31, 2014, BNY Mellon and all of its bank 
subsidiaries were ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ based on the 
ratios and rules applicable to them noted above. A 

bank™s capital category, however, is determined solely 

for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective  84 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) action rules and may not be an accurate representation of the bank™s overall financial 

condition or prospects. Liquidity Standards - Basel III and U.S. Proposals Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and 
BHC liquidity principally have been addressed as a 
supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and 

internationally, without required quantitative 

measures. The Basel III framework requires banks 

and BHCs to measure their liquidity against specific 
liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects 
to liquidity measures historically applied by banks 
and regulators for management and supervisory 
purposes, will be required by regulation. One test, 

the LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity 
maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets equal to the entity™s expected net 

cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under an 
acute liquidity stress scenario. The other, referred to 

as the net stable funding ratio (ﬁNSFRﬂ), is designed 
to promote more medium- and long-term funding of 
the assets and activities of banking entities over a 
one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee issued 

the final LCR document in January 2013 and the final 
NSFR document in October 2014. The Basel III 

liquidity framework, as modified in January 2013, 
contemplates that the LCR will be introduced Jan. 1, 
2015 with the minimum requirement beginning at 
60%, rising in equal annual steps of 10 percentage 
points to reach 100% on Jan. 1, 2019. Similarly, it 

contemplates that the NSFR will be subject to an 
observation period through mid-2016 and, subject to 
any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted 
and data collected during the observation period, 
implemented as a minimum standard by Jan. 1, 2018. 
The U.S. banking agencies finalized rules 
implementing the LCR (as discussed below) but have 
not yet proposed rules implementing the NSFR. In October 2013, the U.S. banking agencies issued an NPR to implement the Basel III LCR in the U.S. and 
on Sept. 3, 2014, they issued a final rule (the ﬁFinal 
LCR Ruleﬂ). Consistent with the Proposed LCR 

Rule, the Final LCR Rule is more stringent than the 
Basel III LCR in several respects, including, the 
eligibility of HQLA and having an accelerated 

implementation timeline as compared with the Basel 
III LCR. The Final LCR Rule also contains several changes 
from the Proposed LCR Rule, including: Ł a transition period for compliance with the daily LCR calculation requirement (during which 
monthly calculation is permitted); Ł total net stressed cash outflows will be 
calculated based on net outflows over a 30-day 
period, plus a maturity mismatch add-on (rather 
than the peak day approach of the Proposed 
LCR Rule); and Ł a definition of operational deposits that does not 
exclude all deposits of registered investment 
companies and registered investment advisers. Since Jan. 1, 2015, covered companies, including 
BNY Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon and 

BNY Mellon, N.A., have been required to meet an 

LCR of 80%, increasing annually by 10% increments 
until Jan. 1, 2017, at which time covered companies 
would be required to meet an LCR of 100%. Separately, as noted above, the Final SIFI Rules 
address liquidity requirements for BHCs with $50 
billion or more in total assets, including BNY Mellon.  

These enhanced liquidity requirements became 
effective on Jan. 1, 2015 and include an independent 

review of liquidity risk management; establishment of 
cash flow projections; a contingency funding plan, 
and liquidity risk limits; liquidity stress testing under 
multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to 
the specific products and profile of the company; and 
maintenance of a liquidity buffer of unencumbered 

highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net 

cash outflows over 30 days under a range of stress 
scenarios. In the release accompanying those rules, 

the Federal Reserve states that these enhanced 
liquidity requirements are designed to complement 
the LCR. The LCR would provide a standardized 

measure to allow comparison across BHCs, while the 
Final SIFI Rules™ internal stress test requirements 

provide a view of the BHC under various scenarios, 
time horizons, and tailored to the profile of the 
company. 
Volcker Rule and Related European Initiatives 

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed broad prohibitions and 
restrictions on proprietary trading and investments in 
or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity 
funds by banking organizations and their affiliates, 

commonly referred to as the ﬁVolcker Rule.ﬂ 
BNY Mellon 85 
  Supervision and Regulation (continued)On Dec. 10, 2013, final rules to implement the Volcker Rule were adopted.  Banks, including BNY 

Mellon, and affiliates generally must conform their 

covered activities and investments with the final 
Volcker Rule regulations by July 21, 2015, and are 

expected to engage in good-faith efforts that will 

result in conformance of all of their covered activities 
and investments by no later than the end of this 
conformance period. The Federal Reserve extended 

this conformance period by one year (until July 21, 
2016) for investments in and relationships with 
covered funds and foreign funds that were in place 
prior to Dec. 31, 2013. The Federal Reserve also 

stated that it intends to act in 2015 to grant an 
additional one-year extension of this conformance 
period until July 21, 2017. The final Volcker Rule 

will also require us to develop an extensive 
compliance program, subject to CEO attestation, 
addressing proprietary trading and covered fund 
activities. The Volcker Rule, subject to certain exceptions, 
prohibits ﬁbanking entities,ﬂ including BNY Mellon, 

from engaging in proprietary trading and limits our 
sponsorship of, and investments in, private equity and 
hedge funds (ﬁcovered fundsﬂ), including our ability 
to own or provide seed capital to covered funds and 
the ability for a covered fund to share the same or 
similar name with a BNY Mellon affiliate.  In 

addition, the Volcker Rule restricts us from engaging 

in certain transactions with covered funds (including, 
without limitation, certain U.S. funds for which BNY 
Mellon acts as both sponsor/manager and custodian). The restrictions concerning proprietary trading do not contain a broad exemption for asset-liability 
management functions, but contain more limited 
exceptions for, among other things, bona fide 

liquidity risk management and risk-mitigating 
hedging activities, as well as certain classes of 
exempted instruments, including government 
securities. Ownership interests in covered funds that 

banking organizations organize and offer will be 

limited to 3% of the total number or value of the 
outstanding ownership interests of any individual 
fund at any time more than one year after the date of 
its establishment, and with respect to the aggregate 
value of all such ownership interests in covered funds 
(when combined with ownership interests in covered 
funds held under the Volcker Rule™s ABS issuer 

exemption and underwriting and market-making 
exemption), 3% of the banking organization™s Tier 1 

capital. Moreover, a banking entity relying on the 
final Volcker Rule™s exemption for sponsoring 

covered funds will need to deduct from its Tier 1 

capital, the value of related ownership interests, 
calculated in accordance with the final rule. The final 

Volcker Rule is highly complex, and its full impact 

will not be known until market practices and 
structures are fully developed. In the European Union, structural reform proposals are likely to be further develop during 2015. 
European and Member State regulators (for example, 
the Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK) 

continue to develop proposals in regard to bank 
structural reform. The details of such structural 

reform proposals continue to be developed, and at 
this stage the final outcome of such proposals is not 
certain. Bank structural reform proposals, if 

implemented, may require BNY Mellon to review its 

existing corporate structure, and may impact upon the 
business activities that BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches can undertake. It is not clear whether bank 

structural reforms in the European Union will operate 
on the basis of changes to corporate structure or 
prohibitions on certain forms of trading (including 
proprietary trading), or a combination of these 
approaches. Derivatives 
U.S., EU and APAC regulators are in the process of 
implementing comprehensive rules governing the 
supervision, structure, trading and regulation of 
cleared and over-the-counter derivatives markets and 

participants. The Dodd-Frank Act, the European 

Market Infrastructure Regulation (ﬁEMIRﬂ), and 
APAC regulations each require or impose, or will 

likely impose, as the case may be, a large number of 

requirements in this area, many of which are not yet 
final. Once these rules are finalized, including with 

respect to how The Dodd-Frank Act, EMIR and 

APAC regulations complement each other in relation 

to cross-border activities, they could affect the way 

various BNY Mellon subsidiaries operate, including 

where and with whom they transact, and changes to 
the markets and participants will impact business 
models and profitability of certain BNY Mellon 

subsidiaries. Money Market Fund Reforms 
Regulators have focused on risks that MMFs may pose to financial stability.  In November 2012, the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council proposed  86 BNY Mellon 
  Supervision and Regulation (continued) several alternative recommendations for money market mutual fund reform, which include requiring 
money market funds to use a floating net asset value, 
requiring them to maintain a capital buffer of up to 

1% of a fund™s value coupled with a holdback of 3 to 

5% on redemptions to create a ﬁfirst lossﬂ position 
and discourage runs, and requiring them to maintain a 
capital buffer of up to 3% of a fund™s value combined 

with other measures, such as investment 
diversification requirements, minimum liquidity 
levels, and/or more robust diversification 
requirements. In July 2014, the SEC finalized rules (the ﬁMMF Rulesﬂ) that will require institutional prime money 
market funds (including institutional municipal 
money market funds) to maintain a floating NAV 

based on the current market value of the securities in 
their portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place. Previously, such funds could maintain a stable NAV 
of $1.00. Government MMFs and retail MMFs are 

exempt from these requirements and may continue to 
maintain a stable NAV, provided each type of fund 

continues to satisfy certain definitional requirements 
under the new rule. The MMF Rules also provide 

new tools to MMFs™ boards of directors to address 

high net redemption activity during periods of 
market stress. In particular the MMF Rules allow a 

MMF™s board of directors to impose liquidity fees or 

temporarily suspend redemptions if a MMF™s level 

of weekly liquid assets falls below certain thresholds. 
Government MMFs are not required to adopt the 
liquidity fees and redemption gates provision, but 
they may opt to do so. In addition, there is a two 

year transition period before implementation of the 
floating NAV and fees and gating structures is 

required. Beyond these primary reforms, the MMF Rules also expand disclosure requirements, tighten the 
diversification requirements and impose additional 
stress testing requirements. There is a transition 

period concluding in April 2016 before mandatory 

implementation is required. The MMF Rules also 

introduce a new Form N-CR, which will require 
MMFs to disclose certain events (for example, the 
imposition or removal of fees or gates, the primary 
consideration or factors taken into account by a 
board of directors, in its decision related to fees and 
gates, and portfolio security defaults). The MMF 

Rules establish a transition period concluding in July 
2015 before reporting on Form N-CR is required. The final MMF Rules are highly complex, and we 
are continuing to evaluate their impact. It is possible 

that the MMR Rules could result in changes to the 
size and composition of our AUM, AUC/A, and total 

deposits. Meanwhile, EU legislation on MMFs proposed by the EC, which has been under consideration in the 
European Parliament, include: (i) requirements for 
ﬁconstant valueﬂ (ﬁCNAVﬂ) MMFs, including a 3% 

capital buffer, or alternatively, a fees and gate 

structure; (ii) a requirement to perform internal credit 
ratings; (iii) restrictions on the types of assets in 
which MMFs can invest, including with respect to 
asset-backed commercial paper; (iv) diversification 
restrictions, including on collateral received on 
reverse repurchase agreements; (v) a prohibition or 
restriction of use of amortized cost accounting in 
ﬁvariableﬂ NAV funds; (vi) a possible ban on MMF-

level ratings, and (vii) stricter disclosure 
requirements. Tri-Party Repo Reform 

BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 

party repurchase, or repo, market and currently has 
approximately 85% of the market share of the U.S. 
tri-party repo market. As agent, we facilitate 

settlement between sellers (cash borrowers) and 
buyers (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a seller and buyer 
investor agree to a tri-party repo trade and send 
instructions to us. We settle the trade, maintain 

custody of the collateral (the subject securities of the 
repo), monitor the eligibility and sufficiency of the 

collateral, and execute the payment and delivery 
instructions agreed to and provided by the principles. Regulatory agencies worldwide have re-examined systemic risks in various financial markets, including 
the tri-party repo market. The Payment Risk 

Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

sponsored a Task Force on Tri-Party Repo 


party repo market and to decide what changes should 
be implemented so that such risks may be mitigated 
or avoided in the future. The Task Force issued its 

final report regarding the tri-party repo market in 
2012. BNY Mellon has reduced the amount of secured 
intraday credit it provides to sellers in connection BNY Mellon 87 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued)with their tri-party repo trades in a number of ways, including limiting the collateral eligible to secure 
intraday credit to certain more liquid asset classes, 
reducing the amount of time during which we extend 
intraday credit, reducing the amount of credit 
provided in connection with processing collateral 
substitutions, introducing a functionality that enables 
us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades into new trades without 
extending credit, and requiring sellers to prefund their 
repayment obligations in connection with trades 
collateralized by DTC sourced securities. This combination of measures, together with the technological enhancements put in place in 2014, 
have practically eliminated (defined as a 90% 
reduction) intraday credit related to tri-party repo 
processing. Recovery and Resolution Planning 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC have jointly issued a final rule 
requiring certain organizations, including each BHC 

with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such 
as BNY Mellon, to submit annually to the Federal 

Reserve and the FDIC a plan for its rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or 
failure. In addition, the FDIC has issued a final rule 

that requires insured depository institutions with $50 
billion or more in total assets, such as The Bank of 

New York Mellon, to submit annually to the FDIC a 

plan for resolution in the event of the institution™s 

failure. The two resolution plan rules are complementary, and 
we have been submitting our resolution plans in 
conformity with both rules since 2012. The public 

portions of our resolution plan are available on the 
FDIC™s website. 
In August 2014, the regulators notified the 1
waveﬂ filers, including BNY Mellon, that certain 

shortcomings in the 2013 resolution plans must be 
addressed in the 2015 resolution plans. The FDIC 

determined that the plans submitted by the first-wave 
filers are not credible and do not facilitate an orderly 
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The 

Federal Reserve was silent as to its determination 
regarding credibility of the plans, but did state that 
the first-wave filers, including BNY Mellon, must 

take immediate action to improve their resolvability 
and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. 
If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve jointly determine that the plan we will submit on or before 
July 1, 2015 is not credible and we fail to address the 
deficiencies in a timely manner, the FDIC and the 

Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent 
capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or 
restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. If 

we continue to fail to adequately remedy any 
deficiencies, we could be required to divest assets or 
operations that the regulators determine necessary to 
facilitate our orderly resolution. In January 2014, the Federal Reserve issued heightened supervisory expectations for recovery and 
resolution preparedness. The expectations apply to 

eight domestic bank holding companies designated by 
the Federal Reserve, including BNY Mellon, and 

cover the following five topics: collateral 
management; payment, clearing and settlement 
activities; liquidity and funding; management 
information systems; and shared and outsourced 
services. European legislators implemented European bank recovery and resolution legislation to operate in the 
European Union. The European Union Bank 

Recovery and Resolution Directive (ﬁBRRDﬂ) 
commenced in EU Member States on Jan. 1, 2015. 
Various BNY Mellon subsidiaries and branches fall 

within the scope of BRRD. BRRD requires EU-domiciled credit institutions, and certain other firms, to prepare recovery plans. We 

prepared a recovery plan for The Bank of New York 

Mellon (International) Limited (ﬁBNYMILﬂ) in June 
2014 and Phase 1a and 1b of the UK resolution pack 
in August 2014, which were both submitted to the 

Prudential Regulation Authority (ﬁPRAﬂ).  In 

Belgium, we submitted our second recovery plan with 
respect to The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV to 

the National Bank of Belgium in November 2014. 
We expect to submit updated recovery plans with 

respect to BNYMIL and The Bank of New York 

Mellon SA/NV during 2015.  We also expect to 

develop recovery plans for certain additional BNY 
Mellon entities in the EMEA region during 2015 and 

2016. Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting 

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision requires identified global systemically important 
banks, including BNY Mellon, to complete an annual 

self-assessment questionnaire developed by the  88 BNY Mellon 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued) BCBS concerning principles for effective risk data 
aggregation and risk reporting. The BCBS developed 

these principles upon recommendation of the FSB, 
and they are designed to strengthen risk data 
aggregation and reporting practices, enhance bank 
risk management and decision-making processes, and 
contribute to improving resolvability.  The 

questionnaire allows financial institutions to gauge 
current level of compliance and identify areas that 
will need additional work. BNY Mellon continues to 

work towards full implementation of the BCBS 
principles. Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company If the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as The Bank 

of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., upon its 

insolvency or in certain other circumstances, the 
FDIC has the power to: Ł Transfer any of the depository institution™s assets 
and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly 

formed ﬁbridgeﬂ bank without the approval of the 
depository institution™s creditors; 
Ł Enforce the terms of the depository institution™s 

contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to 
any provisions triggered by the appointment of 
the FDIC in that capacity; or Ł Repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to 

which the depository institution is a party, the 

performance of which is determined by the FDIC 
to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or 

repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC 
to promote the orderly administration of the 
depository institution. In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders 

of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for 
administrative expenses against an insured depository 
institution would be afforded a priority over other 

general unsecured claims against such an institution, 
including claims of debt holders of the institution, in 
the ﬁliquidation or other resolutionﬂ of such an 
institution by any receiver.  As a result, whether or 

not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt 
obligations of The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A., the debt holders would be treated 
differently from, and could receive, if anything, 

substantially less than, the depositors of the bank. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime 

(known as the ﬁorderly liquidation authorityﬂ) for 
systemically important financial companies, 
including BHCs and their affiliates.  
Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC 
may be appointed as receiver for the systemically 
important institution, and its failed non-bank 
subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the entity if, 
among other conditions, it is determined at the time 
of the institution™s failure that it is in default or in 

danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the 
stability of the U.S. financial system. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, 

and the rights and obligations of creditors and other 
parties who have dealt with the institution, would be 
determined under the Dodd-Frank Act™s orderly 

liquidation authority provisions, and not under the 
insolvency law that would otherwise apply.  The 

powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation 
authority were based on the powers of the FDIC as 
receiver for depository institutions under the FDI Act.  

However, the provisions governing the rights of 

creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were 
modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with 
the treatment of creditors™ claims under the U.S. 

Bankruptcy Code as compared to the treatment of 
those claims under the new authority.  Nonetheless, 

substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist 

as between these two regimes, including the right of 
the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor 
claims in some circumstances, the use of an 
administrative claims procedure to determine 
creditors™ claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure 

utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of 
the FDIC to transfer claims to a ﬁbridgeﬂ entity. 
The orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment.  

However, a number of rulemakings are required 

under the terms of Dodd-Frank, and a number of 
provisions of the new authority require clarification. 
The FDIC has completed its initial phase of 
rulemaking under the orderly liquidation authority, 

but additional rules are under consideration. These 

rules may affect the manner in which the new 

authority is applied, particularly with respect to 
broker-dealer and futures commission merchant 

subsidiaries of BHCs. BNY Mellon 89 
   Supervision and Regulation (continued)In December 2013, the FDIC released a notice outlining the single point of entry (ﬁSPOEﬂ) strategy 
and soliciting comments on how a SPOE resolution 
approach would be implemented in the U.S. A SPOE 

approach would replace a distressed BHC with a 
bridge holding company, which could then continue 

subsidiary bank operations. The agencies may 

require minimum amounts of equity and unsecured 
debt at the holding company level to assist in 
implementing the SPOE strategy. 
It is expected that EU legislation will differ 
significantly from the U.S. SPOE approach, which is 
addressed more specifically below in the ﬁOperations 
and Regulations Outside of the United Statesﬂ 
discussion. Depositor Preference 
Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for 
administrative expenses and employee compensation 
against an insured depository institution are afforded 

a priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such an institution, including federal funds and letters 
of credit, in the ﬁliquidation or other resolutionﬂ of 
such an institution by any receiver.  The UK Financial 

Services Authority published a consultation paper in 

September 2012 concerning the implications of 
national depositor preference regimes of countries not 
within the European Economic Area (ﬁEEAﬂ) 

(including, among others, the U.S.) that prioritize the 
claims of home-country depositors over those of 
depositors outside the home country if a deposit 
taking banking organization becomes insolvent. 
In September 2014, the UK PRA, as the successor to the prudential functions of the FSA, published 
ﬁSupervisory Statement SS10/14 - Supervising 
international banks: the PRA™s approach to branch 

supervisionﬂ. In SS10/14, the PRA expressed 

concern with non-EEA national depositor preference 

regimes, and stated that the PRA would consider a 

range of options, such as liaising with non-EEA 
regulatory authorities in regard to the non-EEA 
institution™s recovery plan and the adequacy of the 

recovery plan from the perspective of the UK branch, 
or to require certain non-EEA institutions to convert 

their UK branch into a UK subsidiary. 
Transactions with Affiliates 

Transactions between BNY Mellon™s bank 
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Parent and its non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other, 

are subject to certain restrictions, limitations and 
requirements, which include limits on the types and 
amounts of transactions (including loans due and 
extensions of credit from the bank subsidiaries) that 
may take place and generally require those 
transactions to be on arm™s-length terms.  In general, 

extensions of credit by a BNY Mellon banking 

subsidiary to any nonbank affiliate, including the 

Parent, must be secured by designated amounts of 
specified collateral and are limited in the aggregate to 
10% of the relevant bank™s capital and surplus for 

transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the 

relevant bank™s capital and surplus for transactions 

with all affiliates.  Effective in July 2012, the Dodd-

Frank Act expanded the scope of the limitations on 

affiliate transactions to include credit exposure 

arising from derivative transactions and securities 
lending and borrowing transactions. Deposit Insurance 
Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of 
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., accept 

deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC 
insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit 

for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 
for each depositor account. Under the FDI Act, 

insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC 
upon a finding that the insured depository institution 
has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an 
unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or 
has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, 

order or condition imposed by a bank™s federal 

regulatory agency. 
The FDIC™s Deposit Insurance Fund (the ﬁDIFﬂ) is 
funded by assessments on insured depository 
institutions. The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based 

on a bank™s average consolidated total assets, less the 

average tangible equity of the insured depository 
institution during the assessment period. For larger 

institutions, such as The Bank of New York Mellon 

and BNY Mellon, N.A., assessments are determined 

based on CAMELS ratings and forward-looking 
financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, 
which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the 
assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FDIC to 
determine whether and to what extent adjustments to 
the assessment base are appropriate for custody 
banks. During 2011, the FDIC concluded that certain 
 90 BNY Mellon 
   Supervision and Regulation (continued) low-risk liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks 
that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. 
This has the effect of reducing the amount of DIF 

insurance premiums due from custody banks. The 

Bank of New York Mellon is a custody bank for this 

purpose. Currently, under the FDIC™s regulations, a 

custody bank may deduct 100% of cash and balances 
due from depository institutions, securities, federal 
funds sold, and securities purchased under agreement 
to resell with a Standardized Approach risk-weight of 

0% and may deduct 50% of such asset types with a 
Standardized Approach risk-weight of greater than 

0% and up to and including 20%. This assessment 

base deduction may not exceed the average value of 
deposits that are classified as transaction accounts 
and are identified by the bank as being directly linked 
to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account. Source of Strength and Liability of Affiliates 

Federal Reserve policy historically has required BHCs to act as a source of strength to their bank 
subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial 
resources to support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-

Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory 

requirement. Such support may be required by the 

Federal Reserve at times when we might otherwise 
determine not to provide it. In addition, any loans by 

BNY Mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be 

subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to 
certain other indebtedness of its banks. In the event 

of a BHC™s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC 

to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a 
subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy 
trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. In 

addition, in certain circumstances BNY Mellon™s 

insured depository institutions could be assessed for 
losses incurred by another BNY Mellon insured 

depository institution. In the event of impairment of 

the capital stock of one of BNY Mellon™s national 

banks or The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY 

Mellon, as the banks™ stockholder, could be required 

to pay such deficiency. 
Incentive Compensation Arrangements Proposal 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to 
prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding 
incentive-based compensation practices at certain 
financial institutions. On April€14, 2011, federal 

regulators including, among other agencies, the 
FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the SEC, issued a proposed rule which, among other things, would 
require certain executive officers of covered financial 

institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 
billion or more, such as ours, to defer at least 50% of 
their annual incentive-based compensation for a 
minimum of three years. The comment period on the 

proposed rule closed May€31, 2011.  Final regulations 

have not been issued as of this date. Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial 
institutions has been aimed at combating money 
laundering and terrorist financing.€The USA 

PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains numerous anti-money 

laundering requirements for financial institutions that 
are applicable to BNY Mellon™s bank, broker-dealer 

and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds 
and private investment companies advised or 
sponsored by our subsidiaries.€Those regulations 

impose obligations on financial institutions to 
maintain appropriate policies, procedures and 
controls to detect, prevent and report money 
laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the 
identity of their customers.€Certain of those 

regulations impose specific due diligence 
requirements on financial institutions that maintain 
correspondent or private banking relationships with 
non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Privacy 
The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including 
BNY Mellon, from disclosing nonpublic personal 

financial information of consumer customers to third 
parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 
unless customers have the opportunity to ﬁopt outﬂ of 
the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act 

restricts information sharing among affiliates for 

marketing purposes. Acquisitions/Transactions 

Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving 

depository institutions or BHCs. The BHC Act 

requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for 
the direct or indirect acquisition by a BHC of more 
than 5% of any class of the voting shares or all or 
substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank, 
savings and loan association or BHC. In reviewing 

bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank 
BNY Mellon 91 
 Supervision and Regulation (continued)regulatory authorities will consider, among other 
things, the competitive effect of the transaction, 

financial and managerial resources including the 
capital position of the combined organization, 

convenience and needs of the community factors, 
including the applicant™s record under the Community 

Reinvestment Act of 1977 which requires U.S. banks 

to help serve the credit needs of their communities 
(including credit to low and moderate income 
individuals and geographies), the effectiveness of the 

subject organizations in combating money laundering 

activities and the risk to the stability of the U.S. 
banking or financial system. In addition, prior 

Federal Reserve approval would be required for 
certain large non-banking acquisitions and 

investments. Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary 
Regulatory Requirements BNY Mellon is registered as a BHC and a financial 
holding company (ﬁFHCﬂ) under the Bank Holding 
Company 

Leach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the 

ﬁBHC Actﬂ).  We are subject to supervision by the 

Federal Reserve. In general, the BHC Act limits a 

BHC™s business activities to banking, managing or 

controlling banks, performing certain servicing 
activities for subsidiaries, engaging in activities 
incidental to banking, and engaging in any activity, or 

acquiring and retaining the shares of any company 
engaged in any activity, that is either financial in 

nature or complementary to a financial activity and 
does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and 
soundness of depository institutions or the financial 
system generally.  
A BHC™s ability to maintain FHC status is dependent 
upon a number of factors, including: Ł its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under the 
prompt corrective regulations of the appropriate 
regulatory agency (discussed above under 
ﬁPrompt Corrective Actionﬂ); and 
Ł the BHC itself, qualifying on an ongoing basis as 
ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under 
applicable Federal Reserve regulations. An FHC that does not continue to meet all the 
requirements for FHC status will, depending on undertake new activities, or make acquisitions, that 
are not generally permissible for BHCs without FHC 
status or to continue such activities. The Bank of New York Mellon, which is BNY 
Mellon™s largest banking subsidiary, is a New York 

state-chartered bank, and a member of the Federal 
Reserve System and is subject to regulation, 
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, 
the FDIC and the New York State Department of 

Financial Services (ﬁDFAﬂ).  BNY Mellon™s national 

bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank 

of New York Mellon Trust Company, National 

Association, are chartered as national banking 
associations subject to primary regulation, 
supervision and examination by the OCC. We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in 
securities underwriting and other broker-dealer 

activities in the United States. These companies are 

SEC-registered broker-dealers and members of 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 

(ﬁFINRAﬂ), a securities industry self-regulatory 
organization.  BNY Mellon™s non-bank subsidiaries 

engaged in securities-related activities are regulated 
by supervisory agencies in the countries in which 
they conduct business. Certain of BNY Mellon™s public finance and advisory 
activities are regulated by the Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board. The SEC issued its final 

Municipal Advisors Rule in September 2013 to 

require municipal advisors to register with the SEC if 
they provide advice to municipal entities or certain 
other persons on the issuance of municipal securities, 
or about certain investment strategies or municipal 
derivatives. The Municipal Advisors Rule became 

effective on July 1, 2014. 
Certain of BNY Mellon™s subsidiaries are registered 
with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or 
commodity trading advisors and, as such, are subject 
to CFTC regulation. The Bank of New York Mellon 

is provisionally registered as a Swap Dealer (as 
defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) with the CFTC, 

through the National Futures Association (ﬁNFAﬂ).  

As a Swap Dealer, The Bank of New York Mellon is 

subject to regulation, supervision and examination by 
the CFTC and NFA.  In connection with certain 

Dodd-Frank clearing requirements, The Bank of New 

York Mellon became a member of LCH Clearnet 

Limited™s SwapClear interest rate swap clearing 
which requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to service in 2012. 
 92 BNY Mellon 
    Supervision and Regulation (continued) Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 

as amended, and as such are supervised by the SEC. 
They are also subject to various U.S. federal and state 
laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations 
of any countries in which they conduct business. Our 

subsidiaries advise both public investment companies 
which are registered with the SEC under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ﬁ™40 Actﬂ), 

including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, and 
private investment companies which are not 
registered under the ‚40 Act.  
Certain of our investment management, trust and custody operations provide services to employee 
benefit plans that are subject to the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 

(ﬁERISAﬂ), administered by the U.S. Department of 
Labor (ﬁDOLﬂ). ERISA imposes certain statutory 

duties, liabilities, disclosure obligations, and 
restrictions on fiduciaries, as applicable, related to the 
services being performed and fees being paid. 
Certain proposed expansions of the definition of a 
fiduciary could require certain BNY Mellon 

businesses to modify their practices, which could 
adversely affect results of such businesses.  
Operations and Regulations Outside the United States In Europe, branches of The Bank of New York 
Mellon are subject to regulation in the countries in 
which they are established, in addition to being 
subject to oversight by the US regulators referred to 
above. The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV 

(ﬁBNY Mellon SA/NVﬂ) is a public limited liability 

company incorporated under the laws of Belgium. 
BNY Mellon SA/NV, which has been granted a 

banking license by the National Bank of Belgium 
(ﬁNBBﬂ), is authorized to carry out all banking and 
savings activities as a credit institution. On Nov. 4, 

2014, the ECB assumed responsibility for the 
supervision of 120 significant banks and banking 
groups in the euro area, including BNY Mellon SA/ 

NV.  The ECB™s supervision is performed in 

conjunction with the relevant national prudential 
regulator (NBB in BNY Mellon SA/NV™s case).  

BNY Mellon SA/NV conducts its activities in 

Belgium as well as through branch offices in the 

United Kingdom, Ireland, Luxembourg, the 

Netherlands, France and Germany. 
Certain of our financial services operations in the UK 
are subject to regulation and supervision by the FCA 
and PRA. The PRA is responsible for the 

authorization and prudential regulation of firms that 
carry on PRA-regulated activities, including banks. 
PRA-authorized firms are also subject to regulation 
by the FCA for conduct purposes.  In contrast, FCA-

authorized firms (such as investment management 
firms) have the FCA as their sole regulator for both 

prudential and conduct purposes although subject to 
the residual overarching jurisdiction of the PRA, if 
matters of systemic significance are in issue. As a 

result, FCA-authorized firms must comply with FCA 
prudential and conduct rules and the FCA™s Principles 

for Businesses, while dual-regulated firms must 
comply with the FCA conduct rules and FCA 

Principles, as well as the applicable PRA prudential 

rules and the PRA™s Principles for Businesses. 
The PRA regulates The Bank of New York Mellon 
(International) Limited, our UK incorporated bank, as 
well as the UK branch of The Bank of New York 

Mellon and, to a more limited extent, BNY Mellon 

SA/NV.  Certain of BNY Mellon™s UK incorporated 

subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment 
business in the UK. Their investment management 

advisory activities and their sale and marketing of 
retail investment products are regulated by the FCA. 
Certain UK investment funds, including BNY Mellon 

Investment Funds, are registered with the FCA and 

are offered for retail sale in the UK. 
Since the financial crisis, the European Union and its Member States have, in the same way as their US 
counterparts, engaged in a significant overhaul of 
bank regulation and supervision. To increase the 

resilience of banks and to reduce the impact of 
potential bank failures, new rules on capital 
requirements for banks and bank recovery and 
resolution have been adopted. The European Union™s 

(ﬁEUﬂ) Banking Union (described further below) has 
been launched. Further measures are under way, 

including providing for a structural separation of the 
risks associated with certain banks™ trading activities 

from their deposit-taking function. The BRRD commenced on Jan. 1, 2015. This 
directive provides for recovery and resolution 
planning and a set of harmonized powers to resolve 
or implement recovery of relevant institutions, 
including branches of non-European Economic Area 

(ﬁEEAﬂ) banks operating within the EEA. The 

directive includes the preparation of recovery and BNY Mellon 93 
    Supervision and Regulation (continued)resolution plans, giving relevant EEA regulators 
powers to impose requirements on an institution 
before resolution actions become necessary; a set of 
resolution tools and powers to facilitate the resolution 
of failing entities, such as the power to ﬁbail-inﬂ the 
debt of an institution (including certain deposit 
obligations); and the power to require a firm to 
change its structure to remove impediments to 
resolvability.  Unlike in the United States, where an 

SPOE approach is expected to be implemented, it 
provides for a ﬁmultiple points of entryﬂ approach 
coupled with intra-group bail-in requirements. Aspects of the Banking Union entered into force on Nov. 4, 2014 in most EU jurisdictions.  The UK is not 

participating in the Banking Union. The key 

components of the Banking Union include a single 
resolution mechanism (ﬁSRMﬂ) and a single 
supervisory mechanism (ﬁSSMﬂ). The SRM approach endorses the bail-in rules established in the BRRD. The SRM provides for a 

Single Resolution Fund, which is to be funded by the 
banking industry.  It also provides for a Single 

Resolution Board with broad powers in case of bank 
resolution. Finally, it provides for EU Member States 

entering into cooperation agreements with non-EEA 
countries with the caveat that in certain circumstances 
they can refuse to recognize proceedings. Various 

BNY Mellon subsidiaries and branches will fall 

within the scope of the SRM. In addition, the Capital Requirements Directive IV (and related Regulation) (ﬁCRD IVﬂ) affects BNY 

Mellon™s EU subsidiaries by implementing Basel III 

and other changes, including the enhancement of the 
quality of capital, and the strengthening of capital 
requirements for counterparty credit risk, resulting in 
higher capital requirements. In the EU Member 

States, the CRD IV also introduces substantive parts 

of the new European supervisory architecture, 
including the development of the Single Rule Book 
for financial services. A ﬁSingle Rule Bookﬂ is to 

replace existing separately implemented rules within 
EU Member States, with a harmonized approach to 
implementation across the EU. Elements of CRD IV 

apply not only to BNY Mellon banking branches and 

subsidiaries but also to investment management and 
brokerage entities. The CRD IV became effective on 

Jan. 1, 2014, with certain provisions phased in from 
2014 to 2019. Our Investment Management and Investment 
Services businesses are subject to significant 
regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
relating to, among other things, the safeguarding, 
administration and management of client assets and 
client funds. Various new and revised European 

directives and regulations will impact our provision 
of these services, including revisions to the Markets 
in Financial Instruments Directive II (ﬁMiFID IIﬂ), 
the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 

(ﬁAIFMDﬂ), the Directive on Undertakings for 
Collective Investments in Transferable Securities 

(ﬁUCITSVﬂ), the Central Securities Depository 
Regulation (ﬁCSDRﬂ), and the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (ﬁEMIRﬂ). These new and 

revised European directives and regulations will 
impact our operations and risk profile and provide 
new opportunities for the provision of BNY Mellon 

products and services. The types of activities in which the foreign branches of our banking subsidiaries and our international 
subsidiaries may engage are subject to various 
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those 

foreign branches and international subsidiaries are 
also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of 
the countries in which they operate and, in the case of 
banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory 
capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they 
operate. As of Dec. 31, 2014, each of BNY Mellon™s 

non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios 
above their specified minimum requirements. European Central Bank SSM and Comprehensive 
Assessments In October 2013, the European Council adopted regulations creating an SSM to oversee banks and 
other credit institutions. The SSM is composed of the 

ECB and the supervisory authorities of the member 
states. It covers the prudential supervision of all 

major banks in the 19 countries comprising the 
Eurozone and non-Eurozone countries that choose to 
participate through close cooperation agreements. In advance of the SSM, the ECB began in November 2013 a comprehensive assessment of certain credit 
institutions, which due to their size and systemic 
characteristics, fall under direct supervision by the 
ECB. The assessment consists of a supervisory risk 

assessment of key risks, an asset quality review to 
enhance transparency of bank assets, and a stress test 
to review the resiliency of bank balance sheets, which  94 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) will be conducted in conjunction with the European Banking Authority.  This assessment continued until 

November 2014. The Bank of New York Mellon SA/ 

NV, our Belgian banking subsidiary, was included in 

this exercise. On Jan. 29, 2014, in addition to the proposed new rules on structural reform of the European Union 
banking sector referred to above, the EC adopted 
accompanying measures aimed at increasing 
transparency of certain transactions in the ﬁshadow 
bankingﬂ sector, including for providing for enhanced 

transparency and reporting of SFTs (securities 

financing transactions). The proposal on structural 

reform of European Union banks is intended to apply 
only to the largest and most complex European Union 

banks with significant trading activities. European Resolution Legislation and Structural 
Reform Proposals 
BRRD. European legislators have initiated proposals to establish European bank recovery and resolution mechanisms to operate in the European Union. The 

BRRD commenced in EU Member States on Jan. 1, 
2015. Various BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches fall within the scope of BRRD. BRRD 

requires EU-domiciled credit institutions, and certain 
other firms, to prepare recovery plans. BRRD 

includes bail-in rules, which will commence EU-wide 
by January 1, 2016, although EU member states may 
choose to commence the bail-in rules earlier. For 

example, the UK implementation of bail-in 
commenced on Jan. 1, 2015. MREL. BRRD also includes a minimum requirement 
for own funds and eligible liabilities (ﬁMRELﬂ) to 
ensure that institutions maintain enough capital 
capable of being written down and/or bailed-in. The 

European Banking Authority (ﬁEBAﬂ) intends to 

finalize the MREL requirements after public 

consultation. It is expected that MREL will be set on 

a case-by-case basis for each institution, based on six 
criteria: resolvability, capital, exclusions from bail-in, 

deposit guarantee schemes, institution-specific risk, 
and systemic risk. However, it is not yet clear how 

the MREL requirement will align with the global 

TLAC requirement. Resolution Fund. The EU proposals also require each 
EU Member State (either individually, or collectively 
with other EU Member States) to establish a 
resolution fund, which is to be funded by the banking industry.  Most EU Member States will participate in 

a Single Resolution Fund (ﬁSRFﬂ), under the control 
of a Single Resolution Board (ﬁSRBﬂ). The SRB 

commenced operation on Jan. 1, 2015, and has broad 
powers in case of bank resolution. Contributions to 

the SRF start in 2016, and the SRF will build up over 
eight years, to a target level of 1% of covered 

deposits. Certain BNY Mellon entities will be subject 

to contributions to the SRF, most notably The Bank of 

New York Mellon SA/NV.  The Bank of New York 

Mellon SA/NV believes that its contributions to the 

SRF will constitute a meaningful cost for The Bank 

of New York Mellon SA/NV during the calendar 

years 2016 to 2023. The UK is not participating in 

the SRB or SRF. The Bank of England is the 

equivalent resolution authority in the UK, with 
similarly board powers in case of bank resolution. Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive
. Under the 
recast Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (ﬁDGSDﬂ), the scope of deposit protection in the EU 
is being extended to cover most corporate entities, 
and contributions to deposit guarantee schemes are 
expected to move to a risk-based calculation method. 
BNY Mellon expects that the extension of deposit 

protection to most corporate entities will require 
certain BNY Mellon entities to contribute to relevant 

deposit protection schemes. The contributions and 

required systems enhancements may constitute a 
meaningful cost for those BNY Mellon entities. 
Structural Reform. In addition, European and 
Member State regulators (for example, the PRA in the 
UK) continue to develop proposals in regard to bank 
structural reform. The details of such structural 

reform proposals continue to be developed, and at 
this stage the final outcome of such proposals is not 
certain. Bank structural reform proposals, if 
implemented, may require BNY Mellon to review its 

existing corporate structure, and may impact upon the 
business activities that BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches can undertake. European Financial Markets and Market 
Infrastructure 
The EU continues to develop proposals and regulations in relation to financial markets and 
market infrastructures. The MiFID II, Markets in 

Financial Instruments Regulation (ﬁMiFIRﬂ) and 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation (ﬁEMIRﬂ) 
are at the detailed rule-making stage, and involve a 
significant volume of change to be implemented in BNY Mellon 95 
Supervision and Regulation (continued)relatively short timeframes. MiFID II / MiFIR / 
EMIR may create new business opportunities in 
European markets, but will also require existing 
business activities and processes to be reviewed. The 

volume of change required may result in some 
implementation / execution risk. A key policy 

objective of the 2014-19 European Commission is to 
develop a Capital Markets Union in the EU. This is 

likely to create new business opportunities and alter 
the competitive landscape for European capital 
markets. Investment Services in Europe 

The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 
(ﬁAIFMDﬂ), which came into force progressively in 
2014, is having a direct effect on our alternative fund 

manager clients and our depository business and 
other products offered across Europe.  AIFMD 

imposes heightened depository obligations, which 
have both operational and, potentially, capital effects.  

Our businesses servicing regulated funds in Europe 
will be affected similarly by the revised directive 

governing undertakings for collective investment in 
transferable securities, known as UCITS V, which 

was adopted in September 2014 with rules to take 
effect in March 2016.

Risk Factors Making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us, including our common stock, involves 
certain risks that you should carefully consider.  The 

following discussion sets forth the most significant 
risk factors that could affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. However, other 

factors, besides those discussed below or in other of 
our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also 
could adversely affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. We cannot assure 

you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere 
in our reports address all potential risks that we may 
face. These risk factors also serve to describe factors 

which may cause our results to differ materially from 

those described in forward-looking statements 
included herein or in other documents or statements 
that make reference to this Annual Report.  See 

ﬁForward-looking Statements.ﬂ Operational and Business Risk 
A technology disruption or information security 
event that results in a loss of confidential client 
information or impacts our ability to provide 
services to our clients may adversely affect our 

business and results of operations. We rely on communications and information systems 
to conduct our business. Our businesses that rely 
heavily on technology, including our Investment 

Services business, are vulnerable to attacks and 
technology disruptions, which are occurring globally 
with greater frequency.  Our information systems 

have been subjected to cyber threats, including hacker 
attacks, computer viruses or other malicious software, 
denial of service efforts, limited unavailability of 

service, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access 
attempts. We deploy a broad range of sophisticated 

defenses, but notwithstanding these efforts, it is 

possible we could suffer a material impact or 

disruption. The security of our computer systems, 

software and networks, and those functions that we 
may outsource, may continue to be subjected to cyber 
threats that could result in failures or disruptions in 
our business. Despite our efforts to ensure the 

integrity of our systems and information, it is possible 
that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement 
effective preventive measures against all cyber 

threats, or detect all such threats, especially because 
the techniques used change frequently or are not 
recognized until launched, and because attacks can 
originate from a wide variety of sources, including 
outside third parties such as persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to 

terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. 

Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce 
employees, customers or other users of our systems to 
disclose sensitive information in order to gain access 
to our data or that of our customers or clients. Security events may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or 
unauthorized access to our systems or our clients™ or 

counterparties™ confidential information, including 

employees, vendors and customers, as well as 
hackers. An event that results in the loss of 

information may require us to reconstruct lost data or 
reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring 
efforts, may result in loss of customer business, or 

damage to our computers or systems and those of our 
customers and counterparties, would be costly and 
time-consuming, and may negatively impact our 
business, results of operations and reputation. 
Additionally, security events or disruptions of our 

information systems, or those of our service 
providers, could impact our ability to provide services 
to our clients, which could expose us to liability for 
damages which may not be covered by insurance, 
result in the loss of business, damage our reputation, 
subject us to regulatory scrutiny or expose us to 
litigation, any of which could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results 

of operations. In addition, the failure to upgrade or 
maintain our computer systems, software and 
networks, as necessary, could also make us vulnerable 

to attack and unauthorized access and misuse. There 

can be no assurance that any such failures, 
interruptions or security events will not occur or, if 

they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. 

We may be required to expend significant additional 

resources to modify, investigate or remediate 

vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from 
information systems security risks. Furthermore, even 
if not directed at us specifically, attacks on other large 

financial institutions, their service providers or 
industry utilities could disrupt the overall functioning 
of the financial system to the detriment of other 
financial institutions, including us. As a result of the importance of communications and information systems to our business, we could also be 
adversely affected if attacks affecting the third party 

providers of our communications services impair our 
ability to process transactions and communicate with 
customers and counterparties. For a discussion of 
operational risk, see ﬁRisk Management -BNY Mellon 97 
   Risk Factors (continued)Operational/business riskﬂ and ﬁBusiness Continuityﬂ in the MD&A section in this Annual Report. 
If we fail to update our technology, develop and 
market new technology to meet our clients™ needs or 

protect our intellectual property, our business may 

be adversely affected. 
We are dependent on technology because many of our 
products and services involve processing large 

volumes of data requiring global capabilities and 
scale from our technology platforms. Rapid 

technological changes, together with competitive 
pressures, require us to make significant and ongoing 
investments in technology to develop competitive 
new products and services or adopt new technologies. 
Our financial performance depends in part on our 
ability to develop and market these new products and 
services, to adopt or develop new technologies that 
differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies 

and to deliver these products and services to the 
market in a timely manner at a competitive price. The 

unsuccessful implementation of technological 
upgrades and new products and services may 
adversely impact our ability to service and retain 
customers. We cannot provide any assurance that our 

technology spending will achieve gains in 
competitiveness or profitability, and the costs we 

incur in product development could be substantial. The failure to maintain an adequate technology infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope 
of our business could impact operations and impede 
our productivity and growth, which could cause our 
earnings to decline or could impact our ability to 
comply with regulatory obligations leading to 
regulatory fines and sanctions. In addition, the failure 
to ensure adequate review and consideration of 
critical business changes prior to and during 
introduction and deployment of key technological 
systems or failure to adequately align evolving client 
commitments and expectations with operational 
capabilities could have a negative impact on our 
operations. We rely on a variety of measures to protect our 
intellectual property and proprietary information, 
including copyrights, trademarks, patents and 
controls on access and distribution. These measures 

may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of 
our intellectual property or proprietary information 
and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. 
Furthermore, if a third party were to assert a claim of infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary 
rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against 
us, we could be required to spend significant amounts 
to defend such claims, develop alternative methods of 
operations, pay substantial money damages or obtain 
a license from the third party. 
We are subject to extensive government regulation 
and supervision and have been impacted by the 
significant amount of rulemaking since the 2008 
financial crisis. These rules and regulations have, 

and could in the future, compel us to change how 
we manage our businesses which could have a 
material adverse effect on our business, financial 

condition and results of operations. In addition, 

these rules and regulations have increased our 
compliance and operational risks and costs. We operate in a highly regulated environment, and 
are subject to a comprehensive statutory and 
regulatory regime, including oversight by 
governmental agencies both in the U.S. and outside 
the U.S. Since the 2008 financial crisis, domestic and 

international policy makers and regulators have 
substantially increased their focus on the financial 
services industry. New or modified regulations and 

related regulatory guidance and supervisory oversight 
are significantly altering the regulatory framework in 
which we operate and have affected how we analyze 

certain business opportunities, increased our 
regulatory capital requirements, altered the revenue 
profile of certain of our core activities and imposed 
additional costs on us. In addition, they could 
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial 

condition and results of operations and have other 
negative consequences. The regulatory and 

supervisory focus of U.S. banking agencies is 
primarily intended to protect the safety and soundness 
of the banking system and federally insured deposits, 
and not to protect investors in our securities or 
creditors. Additionally, banking regulators have wide 

discretion in the ongoing examination and the 
enforcement of applicable banking statutes, 
regulations, and guidelines, and may restrict our 
ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions, 
or may require us to maintain more capital or highly 
liquid assets. In common with their U.S. counterparts, European policy makers and regulators have also increased 
their focus on financial services providers and our 
European operations are directly affected and will 

continue to be affected by the changes to the

    Risk Factors (continued)In addition to the direct effects on us, many of our 
clients are subject to significant regulatory 
requirements and retain our services in order for us to 
assist them in complying with those legal 
requirements. Changes in these regulations can 
significantly affect the services that we are asked to 

provide, as well as our costs. In addition, U.S. regulatory agencies - banking, securities and commodities - continue to publish 
notices of proposed regulations required by the Dodd-
Frank Act, and new bodies created by the Dodd-

Frank Act (including the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau) have commenced operations. The related 

findings of various regulatory and commission 
studies, the interpretations issued as part of the 
rulemaking process and the final regulations that are 
issued with respect to various elements of the new 
law may cause changes that impact the profitability of 
our business activities and require that we change 
certain of our business practices and plans. These 

changes will continue to expose us to additional 
regulatory costs and require us to invest significant 
management attention and resources to make any 
necessary changes, all of which could impact our 
profitability. See ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in this 

Annual Report for additional information regarding 
the potential impact of the regulatory environment on 
our business. Failure to comply with these regulations, as well as other laws, regulations or policies, could result in 
sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money 
penalties and reputational damage, which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial 

condition and results of operations. Although we have 

policies and procedures designed to prevent any such 
violations, there can be no assurance that such 
violations will not occur. If violations do occur, they 

could damage our reputation, increase our legal and 
compliance costs, and ultimately adversely impact 
our results of operations. Laws, regulations or 
policies currently affecting us and our subsidiaries 

may change at any time. Regulatory authorities may 
also change their interpretation of these statutes and 
regulations. Therefore, our business may also be 

adversely affected by future changes in laws, 

regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory 
approaches to compliance and enforcement. See 
ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in this Annual Report. 
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including 
ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ status or 
capital adequacy rules more generally, could result 

in limitations on our activities and adversely affect 

our business and financial condition. Under regulatory capital adequacy rules and other regulatory requirements, BNY Mellon and our 

subsidiary banks must meet thresholds that include 
quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain 
off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative 

judgments by regulators about components, risk 
weightings and other factors. As discussed under 

ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in this Annual Report, 

BNY Mellon is regulated as a BHC and a financial 

holding company (ﬁFHCﬂ). Our ability to maintain 
our status as an FHC is dependent upon a number of 
factors, including our U.S. bank subsidiaries™ 
qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ 
and ﬁwell managedﬂ under the banking agencies™ 
prompt corrective action regulations and upon BNY 
Mellon qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under applicable 
Federal Reserve regulations. Failure by BNY Mellon 

or one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to qualify as 
ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ, if 
unremedied over a period of time, would cause us to 
lose our status as an FHC and could affect the 

confidence of clients in us, compromising our 
competitive position. Additionally, an FHC that does 

not continue to meet all the requirements for FHC 
status could lose the ability to undertake new 
activities or make acquisitions that are not generally 
permissible for BHCs without FHC status or to 
continue such activities. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries 
are also subject to capital requirements, administered 
by the Federal Reserve in the case of The Bank of 

New York Mellon and by the OCC in the case of our 

national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and 

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 

National Association. Failure by one of our bank 

subsidiaries to maintain its status as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ could lead to, among other things, higher 
FDIC assessments and could have reputational and 
associated business consequences. A further failure 

by BNY Mellon or one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries 

to maintain its status as ﬁadequately capitalizedﬂ 
would lead to regulatory sanctions and limitations 
and could lead the federal banking agencies to take 
ﬁprompt corrective action.ﬂ If our company or our subsidiary banks failed to meet the minimum capital rules and other regulatory  102 BNY Mellon 
  Risk Factors (continued) requirements, we may not be able to deploy capital in the operation of our business or distribute capital to 
stockholders, which may adversely affect our 

business. If we are not able to meet the additional, 
more stringent, capital adequacy standards that were 
recently promulgated, we may not remain ﬁwell 
capitalized.ﬂ See ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ and 
the ﬁLiquidity and dividendsﬂ and ﬁCapital - Capital 
adequacyﬂ sections in the MD&A - Results of 

Operations section in this Annual Report.  Once the 

more stringent capital requirements applicable to G-
SIBs are fully effective, as a G-SIB, we and certain of 

our banking subsidiaries will be subject to higher 
capital requirements than many of our U.S. and non-
U.S. competitors, leading to a potential competitive 
disadvantage and negative impact on our businesses 
and results of operations. Failure to meet current or 
future capital requirements, including those imposed 
by the Final Capital Rules or by regulators in 
implementing other portions of the Basel III 
framework, could materially adversely affect our 

financial condition. Although we expect to continue to satisfy our regulatory capital requirements, there can be no 
assurances that we will not need to hold significantly 
more regulatory capital than we currently estimate in 
order to satisfy an applicable minimum capital ratio, 
plus any buffers. An inability to meet regulatory 

expectations regarding our compliance with 
applicable capital adequacy rules may also negatively 
impact the assessment of BNY Mellon and its U.S. 

banking subsidiaries by U.S. banking regulators and 
our ability to make capital distributions. Finally, our estimated capital ratios and related 
components are based on our current interpretation, 
expectations and understanding of the regulatory 
capital rules and are subject to, among other things, 
ongoing regulatory review, regulatory approval of 

certain risk models, additional refinements, 
modifications or enhancements (whether required or 
otherwise) to our models, and further implementation 
guidance in the United States. Any modifications or 

requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews or 
the continued implementation of Basel III and related 
amendments to the regulatory capital framework in 
the United States could result in changes in our risk-
weighted assets or other elements involved in the 
calculation of BNY Mellon™s capital ratios, which 

could negatively impact our capital ratios and ability 
to achieve the capital requirements as we project or as 
required. Further, because operational risk is 
measured based not only upon our historical loss 
experience but also upon ongoing events in the 
banking industry generally, our level of operational 

risk-weighted assets could significantly increase or 
otherwise remain elevated for the foreseeable future 
and may potentially be subject to significant 
volatility. 
New lines of business, new products and services or strategic project initiatives may subject us to 
additional risks, and the failure to implement these 
initiatives could affect our results of operations. 
From time to time, we may launch new lines of business or offer new products and services within 

existing lines of business. There are substantial risks 

and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We 

invest significant time and resources in developing 
and marketing new lines of business, products and 
services. Regulatory requirements can affect whether 

initiatives are able to be brought to market in a 
manner that is timely and attractive to our customers. 
Initial timetables for the development and 
introduction of new lines of business and/or new 
products or services may not be achieved and price 
and profitability targets may not be met. Furthermore, 

our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new 
businesses or products and services generally require 
startup costs while revenues may take time to 
develop, which may adversely impact our results of 
operations. Additionally from time to time we undertake strategic project initiatives. Significant effort and resources 

are necessary to manage and oversee the successful 
completion of these initiatives. These initiatives often 

place significant demands on a limited number of 
employees with subject matter expertise and 
management and may involve significant costs to 
implement as well as increase operational risk as 
employees learn to process transactions under new 
systems. The failure to properly execute on these 

strategic initiatives could adversely impact our 
business and results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected if we are 
unable to attract and retain employees. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to 
attract new employees, retain and motivate our 
existing employees, and continue to compensate our 
employees competitively amid heightened regulatory 
restrictions. Competition for the best employees in BNY Mellon 103 
  Risk Factors (continued)most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to recruit and retain key 
personnel. We may also rely on certain employees 

with subject matter expertise to assist in the 
implementation of important initiatives. Factors that 

affect our ability to attract and retain talented and 

diverse employees include our compensation and 
benefits programs, our profitability and our reputation 
for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. 
Our ability to attract and retain key executives and 
other employees may be hindered as a result of 
regulations applicable to incentive compensation and 
other aspects of our compensation programs. These 

regulations, which include and are expected to 
include mandatory deferrals, clawback requirements 
and other limits on incentive compensation, may not 
apply to some of our competitors and to other 
institutions with which we compete for talent. Our 
ability to recruit and retain key talent may be 
adversely affected by these regulations. In addition, 

aspects of our compensation programs are 
performance-based. If we do not achieve applicable 
performance thresholds for a relevant period, 
employee compensation may be adversely affected, 

which could impact retention. The loss of employees™ 

skills, knowledge of the market, industry experience, 
and the cost of finding replacements may hurt our 
business. If we are unable to continue to attract and 

retain highly qualified employees, our performance, 
including our competitive position, could be 
adversely affected. 
Regulatory actions or litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm 

our businesses or reputation. Like many major financial institutions, we and our affiliates are the subject of inquiries, investigations, 

lawsuits and proceedings by counterparties, clients, 
other third parties and regulatory and other 
governmental agencies in the United States and 
abroad, as well as the Department of Justice and state 
attorneys general. See ﬁLegal proceedingsﬂ in Note 
22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in this Annual Report for a discussion of material 

legal and regulatory proceedings in which we are 
involved. With regard to many firms in the financial 

services industry, the number of these investigations 

and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties 
and fines sought, has increased substantially in recent 
years. Further, we may become subject to heightened 

regulatory scrutiny, inquiries or investigations, and 

potentially client-related inquiries or claims, relating to broad, industry-wide concerns that could lead to 
increased expenses or reputational damage. For 
example, many participants in the foreign exchange 
industry are currently receiving heightened regulatory 
scrutiny concerning alleged potential manipulation 
with respect to published foreign exchange 
benchmarks and we, like a number of others, have 
received inquiries from government authorities 
seeking information. Recently, significant settlements 

by several large financial institutions with 

governmental entities have been publicly announced. 
The trend of large settlements with governmental 

entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other 

financial institutions in similar actions, especially 
where governmental officials have announced that the 

large settlements will be used as the basis or a 

template for other settlements. The complexity of the 

federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes 
in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of our 
operations and the increasing aggressiveness of the 
regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a 
single event may give rise to a large number of 

overlapping investigations and regulatory 
proceedings, either by multiple federal and state 
agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and 
other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. 

Responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and 
proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of 
the matter, is time-consuming and expensive and can 

divert the attention of our senior management from 
our business. The outcome of such proceedings may 

be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the 

proceedings, which may last a number of years. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential 
proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the 
Federal Reserve, SEC, OCC, DOL, DFS, CFTC, 
NFA, ECB, NBB and FCA. These examinations, 

inquiries and proceedings could, if compliance 
failures or other violations are found, cause a 
regulatory agency to institute proceedings and impose 
sanctions for violations, including, for example, 
regulatory agreements, cease and desist orders, civil 
monetary penalties or termination of a license and 
could lead to litigation by investors or clients, any of 
which could cause our earnings to decline. Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform 
under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a 
duty perceived to be owed to them. This risk may be 

heightened during periods when credit, equity or  104 BNY Mellon 
 Risk Factors (continued) other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors 
are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly held 
company, we are subject to the risk of claims under 

the federal securities laws, and volatility in our stock 
price increases this risk. Actions brought against us may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, injunctions, settlements, 
damages, fines or penalties, which could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition or 

results of operations or require changes to our 
business. Claims for significant monetary damages 
are asserted in many of these legal actions, while 
claims for disgorgement, penalties and/or other 

remedial sanctions may be sought in regulatory 
matters. Although we establish accruals for our 

litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with 
applicable accounting guidance when those matters 
proceed to a stage where they present loss 
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably 
estimable, nonetheless there may be a possible 
material exposure to loss in excess of any amounts 
accrued, or in excess of any loss contingencies 
disclosed as reasonably possible. Such loss 

contingencies may not be probable and reasonably 
estimable until the proceedings have progressed 
significantly, which could take several years and 

occur close to resolution of the matter.  
Any or all of the risks outlined above could result in increased regulatory supervision and affect our ability 

to attract and retain customers or maintain access to 
the capital markets. Adverse governmental scrutiny 

and legal proceedings can also adversely impact the 
morale and performance of our employees. Our businesses may be negatively affected by 
adverse publicity, government scrutiny or other 

reputational harm. We are subject to reputational, legal and regulatory 
risk in the ordinary course of our business. The 2008 

financial crisis and current political and public 
sentiment regarding financial institutions have 
resulted in a significant amount of adverse media 
coverage of financial institutions. Harm to our 
reputation can result from numerous sources, 
including adverse publicity arising from events in the 
financial markets, our perceived failure to comply 
with legal and regulatory requirements, the purported 
actions of our employees or alleged financial 
reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other large and well-known companies and perceived 

conflicts of interest. Our reputation could also be 
harmed by the failure of an affiliate, joint venture or a 

vendor or other third party with which we do 
business, to comply with laws or regulations. 
Damage to our reputation could affect the confidence 

of clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders 
and other stakeholders and could in turn have an 
impact on our business and results of operations. Additionally, governmental scrutiny from regulators, 
legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with 
respect to financial services companies has increased 
dramatically in the past several years. Press coverage 

and other public statements that assert some form of 
wrongdoing often result in some type of investigation 
by regulators, legislators and law enforcement 
officials or in lawsuits.  Certain regulators, including 

the SEC, have announced policies that make it more 
likely that they will seek an admission of wrongdoing 
as part of any settlement of a matter brought by them 
against a regulated entity or individual, which could 
lead to increased exposure to civil litigation and could 
adversely affect our reputation and ability to do 

business in certain jurisdictions with so-called ﬁbad 
actorﬂ disqualification laws and could have other 
negative effects. 
Additionally, a failure to deliver appropriate standards 
of service and quality or a failure to appropriately 
describe our products and services can result in 
customer dissatisfaction, lost revenue, higher 
operating costs, heightened regulatory scrutiny and 
litigation. Should any of these or other events or 
factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there 

is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses 
that we may need to incur to address the issues giving 
rise to the reputational harm would not adversely 
affect our earnings and results of operations. 
Continued litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings involving our foreign exchange 
standing instruction program and resulting adverse 
publicity could affect our reputation and negatively 

impact our foreign exchange business. Beginning in 2009, our foreign exchange standing instruction program became the subject of litigation 
and regulatory investigations and proceedings. See 
ﬁLegal proceedingsﬂ in Note 22 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. These litigation and regulatory investigations 

and proceedings have generated substantial scrutiny BNY Mellon 105 
  Risk Factors (continued)of, and adverse publicity concerning, our foreign exchange standing instruction program. Continued 
litigation involving our foreign exchange standing 
instruction program, and the resulting scrutiny and 
adverse publicity, could affect our reputation and 

discourage clients from doing business with us. We 

cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the pending 
matters involving our foreign exchange standing 
instruction program. If we continue to be subject to 

these proceedings and the resulting adverse publicity 
relating to our foreign exchange standing instruction 
program, our reputation could be further affected, 

adversely impacting our business and results of 
operations. See ﬁFee and other revenue - Foreign 
exchange and other trading revenueﬂ in the MD&A - 

Results of Operations section of this Annual Report 

for more information regarding our foreign exchange 
business, including business practices, results of 
operations and trends. Our risk management framework may not be effective 
in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses. 
Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 

comprehensive policies and procedures and an 
internal control framework designed to provide a 
sound operational environment for the types of risk to 
which we are subject, including operational risk, 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. However, as 

with any risk management framework, there are 
inherent limitations to our current and future risk 
management strategies, including risks that we have 
not appropriately anticipated or identified. In certain 
instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and 
predict risks. However, these models are inherently 
limited because they involve techniques, including 
the use of historical data in some circumstances, and 
judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and 
financial outcome in the markets in which we 
operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and 
timing of such outcomes. There is no assurance that these models will appropriately capture all relevant 
risks or accurately predict future events or exposures. 
The recent financial crisis and resulting regulatory 
reform highlighted both the importance and some of 
the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and 
our regulators remain focused on ensuring that 
financial institutions build and maintain robust risk 
management policies. Accurate and timely enterprise-

wide risk information is necessary to enhance 
management™s decision-making in times of crisis.  If 

our risk management framework proves ineffective or 
if our enterprise-wide management information is 
incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected 

losses, which could materially adversely affect our 

results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to 

fully understand the implications of changes in our 
businesses or the financial markets or fail to 
adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to 
address those changes. If our risk framework is 
ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with 

changes in the financial markets, regulatory 
requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, 
clients or service providers or for other reasons, we 
could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find 

ourselves out of compliance with applicable 
regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. An important aspect of our risk management framework is creating a risk culture in which all 
employees fully understand that there is risk in every 
aspect of our business and the importance of 
managing risk as it relates to their job functions. We 

continue to enhance our risk management program to 
support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable 
and appropriate to our role as a major financial 
institution. Nonetheless, if we fail to create the 
appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our 
employees to managing risk, our business could be 
adversely impacted. For more information on how we 
monitor and manage our risk management 
framework, see ﬁRisk Management - Risk 
management overviewﬂ in this Annual Report. 
Our business may be materially adversely affected 
by operational risk. We are exposed to operational risk as a result of 
conducting various fee-based services in our 
businesses. Examples of operational risk include: the 
risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction 
processing; breaches of the internal control system 
and compliance requirements; fraud by employees or 
persons outside BNY Mellon; business interruption 

due to system failures; failed transaction processing 
or process management; unsuccessful or difficult 

implementation of computer systems upgrades; loss 
or damage to physical assets from natural disasters or 
other events; and other risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems or from external events. Operational risk may 
also include breaches of our technology and  106 BNY Mellon 
    Risk Factors (continued) information systems resulting from unauthorized access to confidential information or from internal or 
external threats, such as cyber attacks. Operational 
risk also includes fiduciary risk and potential legal or 

compliance with applicable laws, regulatory 
requirements or contracts which could have an 
adverse effect on our reputation and could result in 

the imposition of fines or civil money penalties or the 
payment of damages. Further, national regulators in 

the UK and Ireland continue to focus on rules around 
the protection of client assets, with consultative 
exercises having been conducted by the FCA in the 

UK with regard to the UK CASS regime and by the 
Central Bank of Ireland with regard to 
implementation of a new regime in Ireland. As 

previously disclosed, the FCA is conducting an 

investigation into compliance by BNY Mellon, 

London Branch and an affiliate with the FCA™s Client 

Assets Sourcebook, and discussions with the FCA are 

ongoing. The resolution of this matter could have a 

material adverse effect on our results of operations.  

We continue to assess our operational models and 

risks in light of these priorities. Third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, 
clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our 
operations, could also be sources of operational risk 
to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their 
own systems or capacity constraints. We regularly assess and monitor operational risk in 
our business and provide for disaster and business 
recovery planning, including geographical 
diversification of our facilities. However, despite our 

efforts to assess and monitor operational risk, our risk 

management program may not be effective in all 

cases. The occurrence of various events, including 

unforeseeable and unpreventable events, such as 
systems failures or natural disasters, could damage 
our physical facilities or our computer systems or 
software, cause delay or disruptions to operational 
functions, impair our clients, vendors and 
counterparties and ultimately negatively impact our 
results of operations due to potentially higher 
expenses and lower revenues. Operational losses can impact our capital ratios and results of operations. For example, our operational 

loss risk model is informed by external losses, 
including certain fines and penalties levied against other institutions in the financial services industry, 

particularly those that relate to businesses in which 
we operate, and as a result such external losses could 
impact the amount of capital that we are required to 
hold to account for operational risk. In addition, 

when we record balance sheet reserves for probable 
and estimable loss contingencies related to 
operational losses (or when we disclose a range of 
reasonably possible loss for reasonably possible and 
estimable loss contingencies), our estimated exposure 
may not be sufficient to cover our actual exposure, 

which could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations in the period in which such 
actions or matters are resolved or when a loss 
contingency otherwise becomes probable and 
reasonably estimable. For a discussion of operational 
risk see ﬁRisk Management - Operational/business 
riskﬂ and ﬁBusiness Continuityﬂ in the MD&A 
section in this Annual Report. 
A failure or circumvention of our controls and 
procedures could have a material adverse effect on 

our business, reputation, results of operations and 
financial condition. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, 
and corporate governance policies and procedures. 
Any system of controls, however well designed and 
operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances 
that the objectives of the system will be met. Any 

failure or circumvention of our controls and 
procedures or failure to comply with regulations 
related to controls and procedures could have a 
material adverse effect on our business, reputation, 

results of operations and financial condition. If we 
identify material weaknesses in our internal control 
over financial reporting or are otherwise required to 
restate our financial statements, we could be required 
to implement expensive and time-consuming 
remedial measures and could lose investor confidence 
in the accuracy and completeness of our financial 
reports. In addition, there are risks that individuals, 
either employees or contractors, may circumvent 
established control mechanisms in order to, for 
example, exceed trading or investment management 
limitations, or commit fraud. Change or uncertainty in monetary, tax and other 
governmental policies may impact our profitability 
and ability to compete. BNY Mellon 107 
  Risk Factors (continued)The monetary, tax and other policies of the 
government and its agencies, including the Federal 
Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates 
and overall financial market performance. The 

Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and 
credit in the United States and its policies influence 
our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital 
raising activities and the return we earn on those 
loans and investments, both of which affect our net 

interest margin. For example, the Federal Reserve™s 

low interest rate policies have resulted in, and could 
continue to result in, waivers of money market fund 
fees in addition to reductions in our spread-based 
income and net interest revenue. The actions of the 

Federal Reserve also could materially affect the value 

of financial instruments we hold, activity levels, 
liquidity and volatility in the financial markets, and 
impact our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk 
that they may fail to repay their loans. Our business and earnings may also be adversely affected by the monetary, tax and other governmental 

policies that are adopted by various regulatory 
authorities, governments and international agencies. 
As a result of the 2008 financial crisis, there have 
been significant changes in these policies, which have 
imposed additional compliance, legal, review and 
response costs that have impacted our profitability. 

Changes in these policies are beyond our control and 
can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine 

the ultimate effect that any such changes would have 

upon our business, financial condition or results of 
operations. We are subject to competition in all aspects of our 
business, which could negatively affect our ability to 

maintain or increase our profitability. 
Many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world. Competitors include 

other banks, trading firms, broker dealers, investment 
banks, asset managers, insurance companies and a 
variety of other financial services and advisory 
companies whose products and services span the 
local, national and global markets in which we 
conduct operations. We compete on the basis of 

several factors, including transaction execution, 
capital or access to capital, products and services, 
innovation, reputation, and price. Larger and more 

geographically diverse companies may be able to 
offer financial products and services at more 

competitive prices than we are able to offer.  Pricing 

pressures, as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services 

at a lower price, may result in a reduction in the price 
we can charge for our products and services, which 

could negatively affect our ability to maintain or 

increase our profitability. In addition, technological 

advances have made it possible for other types of 
non-depository institutions, such as outsourcing 
companies and data processing companies, to offer a 

variety of products and services competitive with 
certain areas of our business. Additionally, 

competitors may develop technological advances that 
could negatively impact the pricing of our clearing, 
settlement, payments and trading activities. Increased 
competition in any of these areas may require us to 
make additional capital investments in our businesses 
in order to remain competitive. Furthermore, recently implemented and proposed regulations may impact our ability to conduct certain 
of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all. 

The regulatory objectives underlying several 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have not been 

enacted by governments and regulatory agencies 
outside the United States and may not be 
implemented into law in most countries. The more 

restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. 
financial services institutions can put us at a 
competitive disadvantage to our non-U.S. 
competitors. See ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in 

this Annual Report.  These regulations may not apply 

to all of our competitors, which could adversely 
impact our ability to compete effectively. A decline in 

our competitive position could adversely affect our 

ability to maintain or increase our profitability. 
We are subject to political, economic, legal, 
operational and other risks that are inherent in 
operating globally and which may adversely affect 

our business. In conducting our business and maintaining and supporting our global operations, which includes 
vendors and other third parties, we are subject to risks 
of loss from the outbreak of hostilities and various 
unfavorable political, economic, legal or other 
developments, including social or political instability, 

changes in governmental policies or policies of 
central banks, expropriation, nationalization, 
confiscation of assets, price, capital and exchange 
controls, unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings 
and changes in laws and regulations.  108 BNY Mellon 
    Risk Factors (continued) Our international clients accounted for 38% of our revenue in 2014. Our non-U.S. businesses are subject 

to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. 
regulators, including governments, securities 
exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies, 
in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. 
In many countries, the laws and regulations 
applicable to the financial services industry are 
uncertain and evolving, and may be applied with 
extra scrutiny to non-domestic companies, and it may 
be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements 

of local laws in every market or manage our 
relationships with multiple regulators in various 
jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance 
with local laws in a particular market and manage our 
relationships with regulators could have an adverse 
effect not only on our businesses in that market but 

also on our reputation generally. 
The failure to properly mitigate such risks, or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such 
international activities could result in operational 
failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which 
could adversely affect our business and results of 

operations. In addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal 
payments and money laundering, economic sanctions 
and embargo programs administered by the U.S. 

Office of Foreign 

national bodies and governmental agencies 
worldwide, and laws relating to doing business with 
certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA 

PATRIOT Act, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria 

Human Rights Act of 2012 and the UK Bribery Act. 

While we have invested and continue to invest 
significant resources in training and in compliance 
monitoring, the geographical diversity of our 
operations, employees, clients and customers, as well 
as the vendors and other third parties that we deal 
with, presents the risk that we may be found in 
violation of such rules, regulations or laws and any 
such violation could subject us to significant penalties 
or adversely affect our reputation.  In addition, such 

rules could impact our ability to engage in business 
with certain individuals, entities, groups and 
countries, which could materially adversely affect 

certain of our businesses and results of operations. 
For example, if recent events in Russia and Ukraine 
trigger broad sanctions against Russian entities, our 
businesses with those clients, including depositary receipts and investments by certain of our boutiques, 
could be negatively impacted. Further, our businesses and operations from time to 
time enter into new regions throughout the world, 
including emerging and frontier markets. Various 

emerging and frontier market countries have 

experienced severe economic and financial 
disruptions, including significant devaluations of their 
currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on 
sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange 
controls, and low or negative growth rates in their 
economies. Crime, corruption, war or military 
actions, and a lack of an established legal and 
regulatory framework are additional challenges in 
certain emerging and frontier markets.  Revenue from 

international operations and trading in non-U.S. 
securities and other obligations may be subject to 
negative fluctuations as a result of the above 
considerations. The possible effects of any of these 

conditions may adversely affect our business and 

results of operations. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our 
business and operations. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could 
have a negative impact on our business and 
operations. While we have in place business 

continuity and disaster recovery plans, such events 
could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the 
normal operations of our business (including 
communications and technology), result in harm or 
cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a 
similar impact on our clients, suppliers and 
counterparties. These events could also negatively 

impact the purchase of our products and services to 
the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced 
capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or 

disruptions in general economic activity in the United 
States or abroad, or in financial market settlement 
functions, which could negatively impact our 
business and results of operation. In addition, war, 

terror attacks, political unrest, global conflicts, the 
national and global efforts to combat terrorism and 

other potential military activities and outbreaks of 
hostilities may lead to an increase in delinquencies, 
bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our 
experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, 
net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, 

negatively impacting our business and operations. For BNY Mellon 109 
 Risk Factors (continued)example, if recent events in Russia and Ukraine result in wide-reaching sanctions against Russian entities 
which are our clients, we could experience defaults 
by those clients, primarily in trade finance and 
syndicated loans that are not collateralized. At Dec. 

31, 2014, the total amount of our uncollateralized on 
and off-balance sheet exposure to Russia was $243 

million. Our strategic transactions present risks and uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on 

our business, results of operations and financial 
condition. From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives, we have acquired, disposed of, or invested in 
(including through joint venture relationships) 
companies and businesses, and may do so in the 
future. Our ability to pursue or complete strategic 

transactions is in certain instances subject to 
regulatory approval and we cannot be certain when or 
if, or on what terms and conditions, any required 
regulatory approvals would be granted and whether 
they could have an adverse effect on our business, 

results of operations and financial condition. 
Moreover, to the extent we pursue a strategic 

transaction, there can be no guarantee that the 
transaction will close when anticipated, or at all. If a 

strategic transaction does not close, or if the strategic 
transaction fails to maximize shareholder value, our 
stock price could decline. Each acquisition poses integration challenges, including successfully retaining and assimilating 
clients and key employees, capitalizing on certain 
revenue synergies and integrating the acquired 

company™s systems and technology. In some cases, 

acquisitions involve entry into new businesses or new 
geographic or other markets, and these situations also 
present risks and uncertainties in instances where we 
may be inexperienced in these new areas. We may be 

required to spend a significant amount of time and 
resources to integrate these acquisitions. The 

anticipated integration benefits may take longer to 
achieve than projected and the time and cost needed 
to convert off of legacy systems may significantly 

exceed our estimates. If we fail to successfully 
integrate strategic acquisitions, including doing so in 
a timely and cost-effective manner, we may not 

realize the expected benefits regarding such 
acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on 
our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. In addition, we may incur expenses, costs, losses, and other liabilities in connection with the 
defense and/or settlement of legal and regulatory 
claims, investigations and proceedings related to 
actions or omissions of the acquired businesses prior 
to the date of our ownership. Each disposition also poses challenges, including separating the disposed businesses and systems in a 
way that is cost-effective and is not disruptive to our 

customers. In addition, the inherent uncertainty 

involved in the process of evaluating, negotiating or 
executing a potential sale of one of our companies or 
businesses may cause the loss of key clients, 
employees, and business partners which could have 
an adverse impact on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. Joint ventures and non-controlling investments contain potentially increased financial, legal, 
reputational, operational, regulatory and/or 
compliance risks. Notwithstanding our controls and 

risk management framework, which are designed to 
manage these risks, we may be dependent on joint 
venture partners, controlling shareholders or 
management who may have business interests, 
strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. 
Business decisions or other actions or omissions of 
the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or 

management may adversely affect the value of our 

investment, impacting our results of operations, result 
in litigation or regulatory action against us and 
otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Market Risk 
Ongoing concerns about the financial stability of some countries in Europe, the failure or instability 
of any of our significant counterparties in Europe, 
or a breakup of the Eurozone could have a material 
adverse effect on our business and results of 

operations. Despite improved financial market conditions, there remain ongoing concerns about the possibility of 
sovereign debt defaults of one or more European 
countries, bank failures and/or the exit of Greece and 
other countries from the Eurozone. This has led to, 

and could continue to lead to, declines in market 
liquidity, a contraction of available credit, and 

diminished economic growth and business confidence 
in the Eurozone. We are primarily exposed to 

disruptions in European markets in three principal 
areas - on our balance sheet, in certain interest  110 BNY Mellon 
    Risk Factors (continued) bearing deposits with banks, loans, trading assets and investment securities, as well as our Investment 
Management and Investment Services fee revenue. 
Additionally, continued disruptions in Europe could 

lead to a ﬁflight to safety,ﬂ triggering increased client 

deposits and alter the size and composition of our 
balance sheet, which could adversely impact our 
leverage-based regulatory capital measures and 
reduce net interest margin. For additional information 

regarding this exposure, please see ﬁInternational 
operations - Exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, 

Portugal, Greece, Russia and Ukraineﬂ in the MD&A 
- Results of operations section in this Annual Report. 

The partial or full break-up of the Eurozone would be 
unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain. The 

exit of Greece or other countries from the Eurozone 
or the dissolution of the Eurozone could lead to 
redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in 
exiting countries. Any such exit and redenomination 

would cause significant uncertainty with respect to 
outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors 
in any exiting country, whether sovereign or 

otherwise, and could lead to complex and lengthy 
disputes and litigation. The resulting uncertainty and 

market stress could also cause, among other things, 
severe disruption to equity markets, significant 
increases in bond yields generally, potential failure or 

default of financial institutions, including those of 
systemic importance, a significant decrease in global 
liquidity, a freeze-up of global credit markets and a 

potential worldwide recession. The interdependencies among European economies and financial institutions have contributed to concerns 
regarding the stability of European financial markets 
generally and certain institutions in particular. 

Financial services institutions are interdependent as a 
result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other 
relationships. We routinely execute transactions with 

European counterparties, including brokers and 
dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual 
and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a 

result, defaults or non-performance by, or even 

rumors or questions about, one or more European 
financial institutions, or the financial markets 
generally, have in the past led to market-wide 

liquidity problems and could lead to losses by us or 
by other institutions in the future. Given the scope of 
our European operations, clients and counterparties, 
persistent disruptions in the European financial 
markets, the attempt of Greece or another country to 
abandon the Euro, the failure of a significant 
European financial institution, even if not an immediate counterparty to us, or persistent weakness 
in the Euro could have a material adverse impact on 
our business or results of operations. Continuing uncertainty in financial markets and weakness in the economy generally may materially 
adversely affect our business, results of operations 

and financial condition. Our results of operations may be materially affected 
by conditions in the financial markets and the 
economy generally, both in the United States and 

elsewhere around the world. While global economies 

and financial markets have shown signs of stabilizing 
and strengthening over the past few years, a variety of 
factors raise concern over the course and strength of 
the economic recovery, including commodity pricing, 

such as the recent decline in oil prices, instability of 
certain emerging markets, volatile debt and equity 

market values, high unemployment and governmental 
budget deficits (including, in the United States, at the 
federal, state and municipal level), contagion risk 
from possible default by other countries on sovereign 
debt, declining business and consumer confidence 
and the risk of increased inflation. The resulting 

economic pressure on consumers and lack of 
confidence in the financial markets may adversely 
affect certain portions of our business, financial 

condition and results of operations. A worsening of 

these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse 
effects of these difficult market conditions on us and 

others in the financial services industry. In particular, 

we face the following risks in connection with these 
events, some of which are discussed at greater length 
in separate risk factors: Ł A continuing low interest rate environment, 
geopolitical tension, declining oil prices, 
deflationary trends in Europe and Japan have 
increased the demand for low-risk investments, 
particularly in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar.  A 

potential exit by Greece from the Euro, along 
with quantitative easing measures taken by the 
ECB and Japan may compound the ﬁflight to 
safetyﬂ. A ﬁflight to safetyﬂ has historically 

increased BNY Mellon™s balance sheet, which 

would negatively impact our leverage ratio. A 

sustained ﬁflight to safetyﬂ has historically 
triggered a decline in trading, capital markets and 
cross-border activity.  Declining volumes in these 

activities would likely decrease our revenue, 
which would negatively impact our results of BNY Mellon 111 
 Risk Factors (continued)operations, financial condition and, if sustained in the long term, our business. Ł The fees earned by our Investment Management 
business are higher as assets under management 
increase. Those fees are also impacted by the 

composition of the assets under management, 
with higher fees for some asset categories as 
compared to others. Uncertain and volatile capital 
markets could result in reductions in assets under 
management because of investors™ decisions to 

withdraw assets or from simple declines in the 
value of assets under management as markets 
decline. Uncertain and volatile financial markets 
may also result in changes in customer 
allocations of funds among money market, equity, 

fixed income or other investment alternatives. 
Those changes in allocation may be from higher 
fee investments to lower fee investments. For 
example, at Dec. 31, 2014, using the S&P 500 

Index as a proxy for the global equity markets, 
we estimate that a 100-point change in the value 
of the S&P 500 Index spread evenly throughout 

the year, would impact fee revenue by less than 

1% and diluted earnings per common share by 
$0.02 to $0.04. Ł Market conditions resulting in lower transaction 
volumes could have an adverse effect on the 

revenues and profitability of certain of our 
businesses such as clearing, settlement, payments 
and trading. Ł Uncertain and volatile capital markets, 
particularly declines, could reduce the value of 
our investments in securities, including pension 
and other post-retirement plan assets. Ł Derivative instruments we hold to hedge and 
manage exposure to market risks including: 
interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign 
currency risk, as well as credit risk associated 
with our products and businesses might not 
perform as intended or expected resulting in 
higher realized losses and unforeseen stresses on 
liquidity. Our derivative-based hedging strategies 

also rely on the performance of counterparties to 
such derivatives. These counterparties may fail to 

perform for various reasons resulting in losses on 
undercollateralized positions. Ł Our ability to continue to operate certain 
commingled investment funds at a net asset value 
of $1.00 per unit and to allow unrestricted cash redemptions by investors in those commingled 
funds (or by investors in other funds managed by 
us which are invested in those commingled 
investment funds) may be adversely affected by 

depressed mark-to-market prices of the 
underlying portfolio securities held by such 
funds, or by material defaults on such securities 
or by the level of liquidity that could be achieved 
from the portfolio securities in such funds; and 
we may be faced with claims from investors and 
exposed to financial loss as a result of our 
operation of such funds. Ł Low interest rates may result in the voluntary 
waiving of fees on certain money market mutual 
funds and related distribution fees by us in order 
to prevent clients™ yields on such funds from 

becoming uneconomic, which would have an 
adverse impact on our revenue and results of 
operations. Ł Continuing declines in oil prices may impact the 
ability of certain of our clients, including oil 
companies and sovereign funds in oil-exporting 
countries to continue using our services or repay 
outstanding loans. Ł The process we use to estimate our projected 
credit losses and to ascertain the fair value of 
securities held by us is subject to uncertainty in 
that it requires use of statistical models and 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments, 

including forecasts of economic conditions and 
how these conditions might impair the ability of 
our borrowers and others to meet their 
obligations. In uncertain and volatile capital 
markets, our ability to estimate our projected 
credit losses may be impaired, which could 
adversely affect our overall profitability and 

results of operations. Continuing low or volatile interest rates could have 
a material adverse effect on our profitability. 
Our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and changes in 
valuations in the debt or equity markets over which 
we have no control. Our net interest revenue is the 
difference between the interest income earned on our 

interest-earning assets, such as the loans we make and 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and 
the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing 
liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed money. 
 112 BNY Mellon 
 Risk Factors (continued) The global market crisis triggered a series of cuts in interest rates and the tentative recovery has kept U.S. 
interest rates low. A continuing low short-term rate 

environment will likely adversely impact our revenue 
and results of operations by: Ł further compressing our net interest spreads, depending on our balance sheet position at the 
time of change; and Ł reducing our spread-based revenues, resulting in 
continued voluntary waiving of fees on certain 
money market mutual funds and related 
distribution fees by us in order to prevent the 
yields on such funds from becoming uneconomic. A rise in interest rates could trigger one or more of 

the following, which could impact our business, 
results of operations and financial condition, 
including: Ł less liquidity in bonds and fixed income funds in the case of a sharp rise in interest rates resulting 
in lower performance, yield and fees; Ł increased number of delinquencies, bankruptcies 
or defaults and more nonperforming assets and 
net charge-offs, 
as borrowers may have more 
difficulty making higher interest payments
; Ł decreases in deposit levels and higher redemptions from our fixed income funds or separate accounts, as clients move funds into investments with higher rates of return; Ł a decline in our capital ratios; Ł reduction in other comprehensive income in our shareholders™ equity and therefore our tangible 

common equity due to the impact of rising long 
term rates on our largely fixed-income securities 

portfolio; and Ł higher funding costs. A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and 

market risks we face is contained under ﬁRisk 
Managementﬂ in the MD&A section in this Annual 

Report. Market volatility may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and 
our ability to manage risk. As a financial institution, our businesses, including 
our Investment Management, Global Markets, 
Corporate Trust, Depositary Receipts and Securities 

Lending businesses, are particularly sensitive to 
economic and market conditions, including in the 
capital and credit markets. When these markets are 

volatile or disruptive, we could experience a decline 
in our marked-to-market assets, including our 
securities portfolio and equity investments, including 
seed capital. Market volatility may be caused by 

concerns about the liquidity of the global financial 
markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity 
prices, interest rates and currency and commodities 
prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce 
confidence in the financial markets; inflation and 
unemployment; the economic effects of natural 

disasters, severe weather conditions, acts of war or 
terrorism; monetary policies and actions taken by the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks and the 
health of U.S. or international economies. A market 

downturn could also cause a decline in the value of 
the assets that we manage, hold in custody or 
administer, adversely impacting fee revenue and 

certain of our capital ratios, while the costs of 
providing the related services remain constant due to 
the high fixed costs associated with these businesses. 
Fluctuations in global market activity could also 
impact the flow of investment capital into or from 
assets under custody and/or administration and the 
way customers allocate capital among money market, 
equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, 

which could negatively impact our results of 
operations. In addition, market volatility could 

produce downward pressure on our stock price and 
credit availability without regard to our underlying 
financial strength. If the market price of our common 
stock were to decline, we could be required to 
perform goodwill impairment testing. While a 

substantial goodwill impairment charge would not 

have a significant impact on our financial condition, 
it would have an adverse impact on our results of 
operations. For a discussion of goodwill, see ﬁCritical 
accounting estimates - Goodwill and other 
intangiblesﬂ in the MD&A - Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report. 
We use various models and strategies to assess and 
control our market risk exposures but those are 
subject to inherent limitations. Our models, which 
rely on historical trends and assumptions, may not be 
sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited 

historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market 
movements and illiquidity, especially during severe 
BNY Mellon 113 
  Risk Factors (continued)market downturns or stress events. The models that 
we use to assess and control our market risk 
exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree 
of correlation among prices of various asset classes or 
other market indicators. In addition, market 
conditions in recent years have involved 
unprecedented dislocations and highlight the 
limitations inherent in using historical data to manage 
risk. In times of market stress or other unforeseen 

circumstances, such as the market conditions 
experienced in 2008 and 2009, previously 
uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or 
previously correlated indicators may move in 
different directions. These types of market 

movements have at times limited the effectiveness of 

our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur 
significant losses, and they may do so in the future. A 

significant market downturn could materially 
adversely impact our business, financial condition, 
results of operations and ability to manage risk. For a 
discussion of our management of market risk, see 
ﬁRisk Management-Market riskﬂ in the MD&A 
section in this Annual Report. 
We may experience write-downs of securities that we 
own and other losses related to volatile and illiquid 
market conditions, reducing our earnings and 
impacting our financial condition. We maintain an investment securities portfolio of 
various holdings, types and maturities. These 

securities are primarily classified as available-for

sale, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair 
value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a 
component of accumulated other comprehensive 
income, net of tax. At Dec. 31, 2014, approximately 

18% of this portfolio was classified as held to 
maturity and recorded on our balance sheet at 
amortized cost. Our investment securities portfolio includes U.S. Agency RMBS, U.S. Treasuries, sovereign and 

sovereign-guaranteed debt, non-agency U.S. and non-
U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities, 
European floating rate notes, commercial mortgage-
backed securities, state and political subdivision debt, 
foreign covered bonds, corporate bonds, 
collateralized loan obligations, U.S. government 
agency debt, consumer asset-backed securities and 
other securities, the values of which are subject to 
market price volatility to the extent unhedged. The 

low interest-rate environment that has persisted since 
the financial crisis began in mid-2007, which may continue in 2015 and beyond, constrains our ability to 
achieve a net interest margin consistent with 

historical averages. Many of these securities 
experienced significant liquidity, valuation and credit 

quality deterioration during the 2008 financial crisis. 
Non-U.S. mortgage-backed and asset-backed 
securities with exposures to European countries, 
whose sovereign-debt markets have experienced 
increased stress since 2011, may continue to 

experience stress in the future. U.S. state and 

municipal bonds have also experienced stress in light 
of the fiscal concerns that a number of states and 
municipalities face. If these or any of the other 

available-for-sale securities experience an other

temporary impairment, it would negatively impact 
our earnings. If our held-to-maturity securities 

experience a loss in fair value, it would negatively 
impact the fair value of our securities portfolio, 
although it would not impact our earnings unless a 
credit event occurred. Our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated total assets 
(approximately 31% at Dec. 31, 2014), and our loan 
and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of 
our consolidated total assets (approximately 15% at 
Dec. 31, 2014), in comparison to many other major 
U.S. financial institutions due to our custody and trust 
bank business model. As such, our capital levels and 

results of operations and financial condition are 
materially exposed to the risks associated with our 
investment portfolio. For example, the accounting 

and regulatory treatment of our investment securities 
portfolio in an available-for-sale accounting 

environment may have more volatility than a more 
traditional held-for-investment loan portfolio, or a 

securities portfolio comprised exclusively U.S. 
Treasury securities.  Under the Final Capital Rules, 

after-tax changes in the fair value of available-for

sale investment securities will be included in Tier 1 

capital. For example, decreases in the general level 

of interest rates, and corresponding increases in 
mortgage prepayment speeds, which can be caused by 
refinancing activity, could adversely impact the value 

of fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities we hold. 
Conversely, increases in the general level of interest 

rates may adversely impact the fair value of fixed-rate 
debt securities we hold and, accordingly, for debt 

securities classified as available-for-sale, may 

adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive 

income and, thus, capital levels. Since loans held for 
investment, or securities in a held-to-maturity 
accounting environment, are not subject to a fair
 114 BNY Mellon 
 Risk Factors (continued) value accounting framework, changes in the fair value of these instruments (other than incurred credit 
losses) are not similarly included in the determination 
of Tier 1 capital under the Final Capital Rules.  As a 

result, we may experience increased variability in our 
Tier 1 capital relative to other major financial 

institutions who maintain a lower proportion of their 
consolidated total assets in an available-for-sale 

accounting environment. Generally, the fair value of securities in the securities 
investment portfolio held as available-for-sale is 

determined based upon market values available from 
third party sources. During periods of market 
disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our 

investment securities, if trading becomes less 
frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. 
As a result, valuations may include inputs and 
assumptions that are less observable or require 
greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation 
methods which are more complex. These values may 

not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, 
and such values may change very rapidly as market 
conditions change and valuation assumptions are 
modified. Decreases in value may have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial 

condition. If any of our securities suffer credit losses, 

as we experienced with some of our investments in 
2009, we may recognize the credit losses as an other

than-temporary impairment which could impact our 
revenue in the quarter in which we recognize the 
losses. The decision on whether to record an other

than-temporary impairment or write-down is 
determined in part by management™s assessment of 

the financial condition and prospects of a particular 
issuer, projections of future cash flows and 

recoverability of the particular security. 

Management™s conclusions on such assessments are 

highly judgmental and include assumptions and 
projections of future cash flows which may ultimately 
prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and 
circumstances change. On the other hand, securities held in a held-to-maturity accounting environment are 
limited in the actions we can take absent a significant 
deterioration in the issuer™s creditworthiness.  

Therefore we may be constrained in our ability to 
liquidate a held-to-maturity security that is 
deteriorating in value, which would negatively impact 
the fair value of our securities portfolio. If our 

assertions change about our intention or ability to not 
sell securities that have experienced a reduction in 
fair value below its amortized cost we could be 
required to recognize an other-than-temporary loss in 
earnings for the entire difference between fair value 

and amortized cost. For information regarding our investment securities portfolio, refer to ﬁConsolidated balance sheet review

value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer

Operations section in this Annual Report and Note 4 

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in 
this Annual Report. 
We are dependent on fee-based business for a 
substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-
based revenues could be adversely affected by a 

slowing in market activity, weak financial markets, 

underperformance and/or negative trends in savings 
rates or in investment preferences. Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking 
institutions that earn most of their revenues from 
loans and other traditional interest-generating 
products and services. Our fee-based businesses 
include investment management, custody, corporate 

trust, depositary receipts, clearing, collateral 
management and treasury services, which are highly 
competitive businesses. Fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed, the market 
value of assets managed and administered, securities 
lending volume and spreads, and fees for other 
services rendered. Corporate actions, cross-border 
investing, global mergers and acquisitions activity, 

new debt and equity issuances, and secondary trading 
volumes all affect the level of our revenues. If the 

volumes of these activities decrease due to weak 
financial markets or otherwise, our revenues will also 
decrease, which would negatively impact our results 
of operations. In addition, poor investment returns in our investment management business, due to either weak market 
conditions or underperformance (relative to our 
competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts 
that we manage or investment products that we 
design or sell, result in reduced market values of 
portfolios that we manage and/or administer and 
affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract 
BNY Mellon 115 
    Risk Factors (continued)new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees 

that we earn on assets under management. Similarly, 

significant declines in the volume of capital markets 
activity would reduce the number of transactions we 
process and the amount of securities lending we do 
and therefore would also have an adverse effect on 

our results of operations. Continuing low interest 

rates have also resulted in, and may continue to result 
in, waivers of money market fund fees. Our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other 
collective funds, unit investment trusts or exchange 
traded funds, or contribute more to defined 
contribution plans. If there is a decline in the savings 
rates of individuals, or if there is a change in 
investment preferences that leads to less investment 
in mutual funds or other collective funds, or a shift to 
lower fee investment products, our revenues could be 
adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that we 

are forced to compete on the basis of price with other 
financial institutions, fee reductions on existing or 
future new business could cause revenues and profit 
margins to decline. 
The profitability of certain of our businesses has declined since the financial crisis. For example, due 

to changes in fee structures, the margins on our 

clearing and corporate trust businesses have lowered, 
and we do not expect those margins to return to their 

historically high levels. Our FX revenue may be adversely affected by 
decreases in the cross-border investment activity of 
our clients. Our clients™ cross-border investing activity could 
decrease in reaction to economic and political 
uncertainties, including changes in laws or 
regulations governing cross-border transactions, such 
as currency controls. Uncertainties resulting from 

terrorist attacks and/or military actions may also 
negatively affect cross-border investments activity. 
Client volume and our ability to generate revenue on such volume may also be affected by market 

volatility levels. Volumes and/or spreads in some of 

our products tend to benefit from currency volatility 
and are likely to decrease during times of lower 
currency volatility. 
Our FX revenue is also impacted by changes in our 
product mix. A shift by custody clients from our 

foreign exchange programs to other execution options 
could negatively impact our FX revenue. 
Furthermore, continued growth of electronic FX 
trading capabilities may accelerate a shift of volume 
to lower margin channels.  
Credit and Liquidity Risk 
Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our bank subsidiaries, The Bank of 
New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., could 

increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us 
and our rated subsidiaries and have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations and 

financial condition and on the value of the 
securities we issue. Our debt, preferred stock and trust preferred securities and the debt and deposits of our bank 
subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A., are currently rated investment grade by 
the major rating agencies. These rating agencies 

regularly evaluate us and our rated subsidiaries and 
their outlook on us and our rated subsidiaries. Their 

credit ratings are based on a number of factors, 
including our financial strength, performance, 
prospects and operations as well as factors not 
entirely within our control, including conditions 
affecting the financial services industry generally as 

well as the U.S. Government. In addition, rating 
agencies employ different models and formulas to 

assess the financial strength of a rated company, and 

from time to time rating agencies have, in their 
discretion, altered these models. Changes to rating 
agency models, general economic conditions, or other 
circumstances outside of our control could impact a 
rating agency™s judgment of the rating or outlook it 

assigns us or our rated subsidiaries. For example, in 
September 2014 Moody™s issued a proposal regarding 

potential material changes to their global bank rating 
methodology.  In addition, in November 2014, S&P 

proposed adding an additional loss-absorbing 
capacity component to its framework for rating banks 
globally.  If adopted, Moody™s or S&P™s proposed 

changes to its bank rating methodology could impact 
our or our rated subsidiaries™ credit ratings or outlook.  

In view of the difficulties experienced in recent years 

by many financial institutions, we believe that the 
rating agencies have heightened their level of 
scrutiny, increased the frequency and scope of their 

credit reviews, have requested additional information,  116 BNY Mellon 
    Risk Factors (continued) and have adjusted upward the requirements employed in their models for maintenance of rating levels. In 
June 2013, S&P indicated that it is reconsidering its 

inclusion of assumed government support in the 
ratings of eight U.S. BHCs that they view as having 
high systemic importance, including BNY Mellon. 

Currently, as a result of these government support 

assumptions, our ratings and those of The Bank of 

New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. benefit 

from one notch of ﬁliftﬂ from S&P and The Bank of 

New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. benefit 

from two notches of ﬁliftﬂ from Moody™s. S&P 

continues to evaluate whether to reduce its support 
assumptions to below pre-financial crisis levels for 
banks that currently benefit from ratings uplift. There 

can be no assurance that we or our rated subsidiaries 
will maintain our respective credit ratings or outlook 
on our securities. A material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit 
ratings of our rated subsidiaries could have a material 
adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the 

related cost of funding and borrowing, our credit 
spreads, our liquidity and on certain trading revenues, 
particularly in those businesses where counterparty 
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, in connection 
with certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts 

and other trading agreements, counterparties may 
require us or our rated subsidiaries to provide 
additional collateral or to terminate these contracts 
and agreements and collateral financing arrangements 
in the event of a credit ratings downgrade below 
certain ratings levels. The requirement to provide 

additional collateral or terminate these contracts and 
agreements could impair our liquidity by requiring us 
to find other sources of financing or to make 
significant cash payments or securities movements. A 

downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on 

the agency™s relative ratings of the firm at the time of 

the downgrade, may have an impact which is 
comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all 
rating agencies. If a rating agency downgrade were to 
occur during broader market instability, our options 

for responding to events may be more limited and 
more expensive. An increase in the costs of our 

funding and borrowing, or an impairment of our 
liquidity, could have a material adverse effect on our 

results of operations and financial condition. A 

material reduction in our credit ratings also could 
decrease the number of investors and counterparties 
willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us 
and adversely affect the value of the securities we 

have issued or may issue in the future. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may 

take, or what actions we may elect or be required to 
take in response thereto, which may adversely affect 

us. Our and our subsidiaries™ ratings could be 

downgraded at any time and without any notice by 
any of the rating agencies. For further discussion on 
the impact of a credit rating downgrade, see 
ﬁDisclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter 

(ﬁOTCﬂ) derivative instrumentsﬂ in Note 23 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this 
Annual Report. The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties, many of whom are major financial 
institutions and sovereign entities, and our 
assumption of credit and counterparty risk, could 
expose us to loss and adversely affect our business. 
Our ability to engage in routine funding or other transactions could be adversely affected by the 

actions and commercial soundness of other financial 
institutions or sovereign entities. Financial 
institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, 
clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have 

exposure to many different industries and 

counterparties, particularly financial institutions, and 
we routinely execute transactions with counterparties 
in the financial industry, including brokers and 

dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual 
and hedge funds, insurance companies, sovereigns 
and other governmental or quasi-governmental 
entities, and other institutional clients. As a result, 

defaults or non-performance by, or even rumors or 

questions about, one or more financial institutions, or 
the financial services industry generally, have in the 

past led to market-wide liquidity problems and could 
lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
in the future. For example, as a result of our 
membership in several industry clearing or settlement 
exchanges, we may be required to guarantee 
obligations and liabilities or provide financial support 
in the event that other members do not honor their 
obligations or default. These obligations may be 

limited to members that dealt with the defaulting 
member or to the amount (or a multiple of the 
amount) of our contribution to a member™s guarantee 

fund, or, in a few cases, the obligation may be 

unlimited. The consolidation of financial institutions 

in recent years and the failures of other financial 
institutions have increased the concentration of our 
counterparty risk. In addition to our exposure to 
financial institutions, we are from time to time 
exposed to concentrated credit risk at the industry or BNY Mellon 117 
Risk Factors (continued)country level, potentially exposing us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events. 
For example, defaults by companies in the oil and gas 
industry may increase meaningfully as a result of the 
recent decline in the price of oil. The degree of client demand for short-term credit also tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, 
exposing us to further counterparty-related risks. For 
example, investors in collective investment vehicles 
for which we act as custodian may engage in 
significant redemption activity due to adverse market 
or economic news that was not anticipated by the 
fund™s manager. Our relationship with our clients, the 

nature of the settlement process and our systems may 
result in our extension of short-term credit in such 
circumstances. For some types of clients, we provide 
credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, 
which may expose us to potential loss if the client 
experiences credit difficulties. In addition, we may 

incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even 
though our exposure to one of its affiliates or across 

product types is over-collateralized. Moreover, not all 

of our counterparty exposure is secured and, when 
our exposure is secured, the realizable market value 
of the collateral may have declined by the time we 
exercise rights against that collateral. This risk may 

be particularly acute if we are required to sell the 
collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired 
market. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to 
the valuation of collateral significantly increase in 
times of market stress and illiquidity. 
We act as lender™s agent in securities lending 
transactions between our customers, acting as lenders, 
and financial counterparties, including broker-dealers, 

acting as borrowers, wherein securities are lent by our 
customers and the loans are secured by a pledge of 
cash or securities posted by such financial 
counterparties. Typically, in the case of cash 

collateral, we invest the cash collateral pursuant to 
each customer™s investment guidelines and 

instructions. In certain cases, we agree to indemnify 
our customers against a default by the borrower under 
a securities lending transaction and, therefore, may 
have to buy-in the loaned securities with the cash 
collateral or the proceeds from the liquidation of the 
non-cash collateral. In those instances, we, rather than 
our customers, are exposed to the risks of the 
defaulting counterparty on the securities lending 
transaction. From time to time, we assume concentrated credit 
risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group 

level. Such concentrations may be material. Our 
material counterparty exposures change daily, and the 

counterparties or groups of related counterparties to 
which our risk exposure is material also varies during 
any reported period; however, our largest exposures 

tend to be to governmental entities, clearing 
organizations, and other financial institutions. 
Concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the 
failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties 
(or in some cases of our clients™ counterparties) has 

the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss. 
Changes in market perception of the financial 
strength of particular financial institutions or 
sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based 

on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict. 
In addition to our exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to time exposed to concentrated 
credit risk at the industry or country level, potentially 
exposing us to a single market or political event or a 
correlated set of events. We are also generally not 

able to net exposures across counterparties that are 
affiliated entities and may not be able in all 

circumstances to net exposures to the same legal 
entity across multiple products. As a consequence, we 

may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product 
even though our exposure to an entity™s affiliates or 

across product types is over-collateralized. 
Under evolving regulatory restrictions on credit exposure, which include a broadening of the measure 
of credit exposure, we may be required to limit our 
exposures to specific issuers or groups, including 
financial institutions, to levels that we may currently 
exceed. These credit exposure restrictions under such 

evolving regulations may adversely affect our 

businesses and may require that we modify our 
operating models or the policies and practices we use. Although our overall business is subject to these interdependencies, several of our businesses are 
particularly sensitive to them, including our currency 
and other trading activities, our securities lending and 
tri-party repo businesses and our investment 
management business. There is no assurance that any 

such losses would not materially and adversely affect 

our results of operations.  118 BNY Mellon 
 Risk Factors (continued) We have credit, regulatory and reputation risks as a 
result of our tri-party repo collateral agency 
services, which could adversely affect our business 

and results of operations. BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 

party repurchase, or repo, market and currently has 
approximately 85% of the market share of the U.S. 
tri-party repo market. As agent, we facilitate 

settlement between sellers (cash borrowers) and 
buyers (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 
transaction commences after a seller and buyer agree 
to a tri-party repo trade and send instructions to us. 
We settle the trade, maintain custody of the collateral 

(the subject securities of the repo), monitor the 
eligibility and sufficiency of the collateral, and 

execute payment and delivery instructions provided 
by the principals. Providing tri-party repo agent services to repo counterparties exposes BNY Mellon to credit risk at 

certain points in time. To facilitate trade settlement 

and collateral substitutions, we extend secured 
intraday credit to repo sellers. In the event of a 
default by a repo seller to whom we have extended 
secured intraday credit, we would be at risk for the 
market value of the collateral securing such intraday 
credit, and for any shortfall in value after the 
liquidation of such collateral, which could adversely 
affect our results of operations. 
BNY Mellon has reduced the amount of secured 
intraday credit it provides to sellers in connection 
with their tri-party repo trades in a number of ways, 
including limiting the collateral eligible to secure 
intraday credit to certain more liquid asset classes, 
reducing the amount of time during which we extend 
intraday credit, reducing the amount of credit 
provided in connection with processing collateral 
substitutions, introducing a functionality that enables 
us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades into new trades without 
extending credit, and requiring sellers to prefund their 
repayment obligations in connection with trades 
collateralized by DTC sourced securities. This combination of measures, together with the technological enhancements put in place in 2014, 
have practically eliminated (defined as a 90% 
reduction) intraday credit related to tri-party repo 
processing. In connection with our tri-party repo reforms, we are 
in the process of implementing new platforms and 
systems. As with the implementation of any new 

technology, we may experience operational errors that 

could lead to system failures and business 
interruptions and adversely impact our business. If a BNY Mellon client that is party to a repurchase 
transaction cleared by BNY Mellon becomes 

bankrupt or insolvent, BNY Mellon may become 

involved in disputes and litigation with the client™s 

bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in 
regulatory investigations, all of which can increase 
BNY Mellon™s operational and litigation costs and 

may result in losses if the securities in the repurchase 
transaction decline in value. We anticipate that regulators will continue to monitor 
the actions of market participants and use available 
supervisory tools to encourage constructive and 
timely action to reduce sources of risk in the tri-party 
repo market. Failure to meet regulatory expectations 
could result in regulatory and reputation risk and 
additional costs. Additionally, in the event that a significant number of 
tri-party repo transactions are cleared through a 
central clearinghouse, our revenues associated with 
tri-party repo transactions could be negatively 
impacted. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not 

effectively manage our liquidity. 
Our business is dependent in part on our ability to meet our cash and collateral obligations at a 
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected 
cash flows. We attract client deposits through a 

variety of investment management and investment 
servicing businesses and we rely on those deposits as 
a low-cost and stable source of funding. Our ability to 
continue to attract those deposits, and other short-
term funding sources, is subject to variability based 
on a number of factors, including volume and 
volatility in the global securities markets, the relative 
interest rates that we are prepared to pay for those 
deposits, and the perception of the safety of those 
deposits or other short-term obligations relative to 
alternative short-term investments available to our 
clients. We could lose deposits if we suffer a 

significant decline in the level of our business 
activity, our credit ratings are materially downgraded 
BNY Mellon 119 
Risk Factors (continued)or we are subject to significant negative press or significant regulatory action or litigation, among 
other reasons. If we were to lose a significant amount 
of deposits we may need to replace such funding with 
more expensive funding and/or reduce assets, which 
would reduce our net interest revenue. In addition, the 
Parent™s access to the debt capital markets is a 

significant source of liquidity. 
Events or circumstances often outside of our control, such as market disruptions, government fiscal and 
monetary policies, or loss of confidence of securities 
purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds 
markets, could limit our access to capital markets, 
increase our cost of borrowing, adversely affect our 

liquidity, or impair our ability to execute our business 

plan. In addition, clearing organizations, regulators, 

clients and financial institutions with which we 
interact may exercise the right to require additional 
collateral based on market perceptions or market 
conditions, which could further impair our access to 
and cost of funding. Market perception of sovereign 

default risks can also lead to inefficient money 

markets and capital markets, which could further 
impact BNY Mellon™s availability and cost of 

funding. Conversely, if we experience too much 

liquidity, it could increase interest expense, limit our 

financial flexibility, and increase the size of our total 

assets in a manner that could have a negative impact 
on our capital ratios. Recently adopted and proposed regulations have been designed to address certain liquidity risks of large 

banking organizations, including BNY Mellon.  The 

LCR and the Dodd-Frank Act™s enhanced prudential 

standards impose liquidity management requirements 
on us that will likely require us to increase our 
holdings of highly liquid, but potentially lower-

yielding assets. These regulations could also impact 

our ability to hold certain deposits deemed to pose a 
higher risk of runoff in the event of financial distress.  

Under the Proposed U.S. G-SIB Rule, the size of the 
capital surcharge that will apply to large U.S. banking 

organizations is based in part on a banking 

organization™s reliance on short-term wholesale 

funding, including certain types of deposit funding, 
which effectively may increase the cost of such 

funding. Furthermore, certain non-U.S. regulators 

have proposed legislation or regulations requiring 
large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in 

countries in which they operate, and to maintain 
independent capital and liquidity for such 
subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder our ability to efficiently manage our funding 

and liquidity in a centralized manner.  There can be 

no assurances that these measures will be successful 
in limiting BNY Mellon™s liquidity risk. 
As a holding company, we also rely on dividends and 
interest from our subsidiaries for funding. The 

Parent™s policy is to have sufficient unencumbered 

cash and cash equivalents at its holding company on 
hand to meet its forecasted debt redemptions, net 
interest payments and net tax payments over a 
minimum of the next 18 months without the need to 
receive dividends from its bank subsidiaries or issue 
debt. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the Parent was in 

compliance with this policy.  However, there are 

various legal limitations on the extent to which our 
bank and other subsidiaries can finance or otherwise 
supply funds to us (by dividend or otherwise) and 
certain of our affiliates. If we are not able to obtain 

funds from our subsidiaries, we could be required to 
replace such funds through more expensive means 
and/or reduce assets. If we are unable to raise funds 
using the methods described above, we would likely 
need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, 
such as our investment portfolio, central bank 
deposits and bank placements, to meet funding needs. 
We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or we 

may have to sell assets at a discount from market 
value, either of which could adversely affect our 

financial condition and results of operations. Further, 

our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other 
market participants are seeking to sell similar assets 
at the same time, which could occur in a liquidity or 
other market crisis. Additionally, if we experience 

cash flow mismatches, deposit run-off or market 

constraints resulting from our inability to convert 
assets to cash or raise cash in the markets, our 
liquidity could be severely impacted. During periods 
of market uncertainty, our level of client deposits has 

in recent years tended to increase; however, since 

such deposits have a foreseeable potential not to be 
permanent, we have historically deposited these so-
called excess deposits with central banks and in other 
highly liquid and low-yielding instruments. These 

levels of excess client deposits, as a consequence, 
have increased our net interest revenue but have 
adversely affected our net interest margin. 
If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through deposits or access capital markets on 
favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our 

borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our 
liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, 
 120 BNY Mellon 
     Risk Factors (continued) financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. In certain cases, this could require 

us to raise additional capital through the issuance of 
common stock, which could dilute the ownership of 
existing stockholders, or reduce our common stock 
dividend to preserve capital or in order to raise 
additional capital. For a further discussion of our 

liquidity, see ﬁLiquidity and dividendsﬂ in the MD&A 

- Results of Operations in this Annual Report. 
We could incur charges through provision expense 
if our reserves for credit losses, including loan 
reserves, are inadequate. When we loan money, commit to loan money or 
provide credit or enter into another contract with a 
counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses 

if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our 
counterparties fail to perform according to the terms 
of their agreements. Our credit exposure is comprised 
of six classes of financing receivables: financial 
institutions, commercial, commercial real estate, lease 
financings, wealth management loans and mortgages, 
and other residential mortgages. Though credit risk is 

inherent in lending activities, our revenues and 
profitability are adversely affected when our 

borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan 
obligations to us or when there is a significant 
deterioration in the credit quality of our loan 
portfolio. We reserve for credit losses by establishing 

an allowance through a charge to earnings. The 

allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represents management™s 

estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit 
portfolio. We utilize a quantitative methodology, 

which is supplemented with a qualitative framework 
that takes into account internal and external 
environmental factors that are not captured within the 
quantitative methodology, to determine the allowance 

for credit losses. This process requires us to make 

numerous complex and subjective estimates and 
assumptions relating to probable losses which are 
inherently uncertain. As is the case with any such 

assessments, there is always the chance that we will 
fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail 
to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we do 
identify. We cannot provide any assurance as to 

whether charge-offs related to our credit exposure 

may occur in the future. Current and future market 
and economic developments may increase default and 
delinquency rates and negatively impact the quality 
of our credit portfolio, which may impact our charge-

offs. If the allowance for credit losses is inadequate 
due to deterioration in the credit quality of the 
portfolio or significant charge-offs, we would be 

required to record credit loss provisions against 
current earnings, which could adversely impact our 
net income. See ﬁCritical accounting estimatesﬂ in 

the MD&A - Results of Operations section in this 

Annual Report. Other Risks 
Tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions 
with respect to historical transactions may adversely 
affect our net income, effective tax rate and our 

overall results of operations and financial condition. In the course of our business, we receive inquiries and challenges from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax 
authorities on the amount of taxes we owe. If we are 
not successful in defending these inquiries and 
challenges, we may be required to adjust the timing 
or amount of taxable income or deductions or the 
allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of 
which can require a greater provision for taxes or 
otherwise negatively affect earnings. Probabilities 

and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and 
adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary, 

but the reserves may prove inadequate because we 
cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of 
any challenge, settlement or litigation or the extent to 
which it will negatively affect us or our business. In 

addition, new tax laws or the expiration of or changes 
in existing tax laws, or the interpretation of those 
laws worldwide, could have a material impact on our 
business or net income. Our actions taken in response 
to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may 
impact our tax position in a manner that may result in 
lower earnings. See Note 12 to Consolidated 

Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further 

information. Changes in accounting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements and future 
events could have a material impact on our reported 
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows 
and other financial data. From time to time, the FASB, the IASB, the SEC and 
bank regulators change the financial accounting and 
reporting standards governing the preparation of our 
financial statements or the interpretation of those 
standards. See ﬁRecent Accounting Developmentsﬂ 

in the MD&A section and Note 2 to Consolidated 

Financial Statements in this Annual Report. These 
BNY Mellon 121 
Risk Factors (continued)changes are difficult to predict and can materially 
impact how we record and report our financial 
condition, results of operations, cash flows and other 
financial data. In some cases, we may be required to 
apply a new or revised standard retroactively or to 
apply an existing standard differently, also 

retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in us 

restating prior period financial statements. Additionally, our accounting policies and methods are 
fundamental to how we record and report our 
financial condition and results of operations. Some of 
these policies and methods require use of estimates 
and assumptions, such as allowance for loan losses 
and allowance for lending-related commitments, fair 
value of financial instruments and derivatives, other

than-temporary impairment, goodwill and other 
intangibles, and pension accounting, that may affect 

the reported value of our assets or liabilities and 
results of operations. These estimates and 

assumptions are critical because they require 
management to make difficult, subjective and 

complex judgments about matters that are inherently 
uncertain. If subsequent events occur that are 
materially different than the assumptions and 

estimates we used, future results may be materially 
different than estimated. 
The Parent is a non-operating holding company, 
and as a result, is dependent on dividends from its 
subsidiaries, including its principal subsidiary 
banks, to meet its obligations, including its 
obligations with respect to its securities, and to 
provide funds for payment of dividends to its 
stockholders and stock repurchases. The Parent is a non-operating holding company, 
whose principal assets and sources of income are its 
principal U.S. bank subsidiaries - The Bank of New 

York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. - and its other 

subsidiaries. The Parent is a legal entity separate and 

distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries and, 
therefore, it relies primarily on dividends, interest, 
distributions, and other payments from these bank 
and other subsidiaries to meet its obligations, 
including its obligations with respect to its securities, 
and to provide funds for payment of common and 
preferred dividends to its stockholders, to the extent 
declared by the Board of Directors. At the same time, 

Federal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected 
to serve as a source of financial strength to its bank 
subsidiaries and to commit resources to support such 
banks if necessary. 
There are various legal limitations on the extent to 
which our bank and other subsidiaries can finance or 
otherwise supply funds to the Parent (by dividend or 
otherwise) and certain of our affiliates. Many of our 

subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, are 
subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend 
payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or 
reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to 
the parent company or other subsidiaries. These 

restrictions can reduce the amount of funds available 
to meet the Parent™s obligations.  In addition, our 

bank subsidiaries would not be permitted to distribute 
a dividend if doing so would constitute an unsafe and 
unsound practice or if the payment would reduce their 
capital to an inadequate level. Our bank subsidiaries 
are also subject to restrictions on their ability to lend 
to or transact with affiliates and to minimum 

regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well 
as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited 
with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their 
businesses. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity 
basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important 
consideration as there are legal and other limitations 
on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity 
to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, 

including the Parent. Although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level, if our bank subsidiaries or 
other subsidiaries were unable to supply the Parent 
with cash over time, the Parent could be unable to 
meet its obligations (including its obligations with 
respect to its securities), declare or pay dividends in 
respect of its capital stock, or perform stock 
repurchases. See ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ and 
ﬁLiquidity and dividendsﬂ in the MD&A - Results of 

Operations and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
Because the Parent is a holding company, its rights 
and the rights of its creditors, including the holders of 
its securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary 
upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the 
subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the 
subsidiary™s creditors (including, in the case of our 

banking subsidiaries, their depositors) except to the 
extent that the Parent may itself be a creditor with 
recognized claims against the subsidiary. The rights 

of holders of securities issued by the Parent to benefit 
from those distributions will also be junior to those 
prior claims. Consequently, securities issued by the 
 122 BNY Mellon 
  Risk Factors (continued) Parent will be effectively subordinated to all existing 
and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. Our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors 
and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and 
regulations, including those governing capital and 
the approval of our capital plan, applicable 
provisions of Delaware law or our failure to pay full 
and timely dividends on our preferred stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions of 
capital as our Board of Directors may declare out of 
funds legally available for such payments. Although 

we have historically declared cash dividends on our 
common stock, we are not required to do so. In 
addition to the Board of Directors™ approval, our 

ability to take certain actions, including our ability to 
make acquisitions, declare dividends or repurchase 
our common stock, is dependent on, among other 
things, Federal Reserve non-objection under the 
annual regulatory review of the results of the CCAR 
process required by the Federal Reserve and the 
supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-
Frank Act. These evaluations, in turn, are dependent 

on, among other things, our successful demonstration 
that such actions would not adversely affect our 

regulatory capital position in the event of a stressed 
market environment as well as the Federal Reserve™s 

assessment of the robustness of our capital adequacy 
qualitative process and the assumptions and analysis 
underlying the capital plan. There can be no 

assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond 
favorably to our future capital plans. If the Federal 
Reserve objects to our proposed capital actions, we 
may be required to revise our stress-testing or capital 
management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or 
postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions 
and will not be permitted to make any capital 
distributions other than those to which the Federal 
Reserve has indicated in writing its non-objection. In 
addition, if there have been or will be changes in our 
risk profile (including a material change in business strategy or risk exposure), financial condition or 
corporate structure, we may be required to resubmit 
our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve™s current guidance provides that, 
for large BHCs like us, common stock dividend 

payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income 

available to common shareholders under certain 
baseline scenarios will receive particularly close 
scrutiny. A failure to increase dividends along with 

our competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination 
of, our common stock dividend would likely 
adversely affect the market price of our common 

stock and market perceptions of BNY Mellon. 
Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our 
common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to 
preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or 
the distribution of any assets on any liquidation, 
dissolution or winding-up of BNY Mellon will be 

prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event 
that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for 
the then current dividend period of our Series A 

preferred stock or the last preceding dividend period 
of our Series C and Series D preferred stock. In addition, regulatory capital rules that are or will be applicable to us including the Final Capital Rules, the 
SLR, or the Proposed U.S. G-SIB Rule may limit or 
otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, 
including common stock dividends and stock 
repurchases, and may require us to increase or alter 
the mix of our outstanding regulatory capital 
instruments. Any requirement to increase our 

regulatory capital ratios or alter the composition of 
our capital could require us to liquidate assets or 
otherwise change our business and/or investment 
plans, which may negatively affect our financial 

results. Further, any requirement to maintain higher 

levels of capital may constrain our ability to return 
capital to shareholders either in the form of common 
stock dividends or share repurchases. BNY Mellon 123 
Recent Accounting DevelopmentsRecently Issued Accounting Standards 
ASU - 2015-02 - Consolidation (Topic 810): 
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
In February 2015, the FASB issued an ASU, 
ﬁConsolidations (Topic 810): Amendments to the 

Consolidation Analysisﬂ.  This new ASU: 

Ł Rescinds the indefinite deferral of FAS 167 for 

certain investment management funds therefore 
establishing one consolidation model; Ł Eliminates the presumption that a general partner 
should consolidate a limited partnership; Ł Clarifies that some fees paid to a decision maker, 

such as an asset manager, are excluded from the 

evaluation of the economics criterion when 
determining a variable interest entities (VIEs) 
primary beneficiary.  This clarification puts 

greater emphasis on principal risk of loss when 
assessing consolidation risk; Ł Amends the guidance for assessing how 
relationships of related parties affect the 

consolidation analysis of VIEs; and 
Ł Scopes certain money market funds out of the 
consolidation guidance. Based on our preliminary review of the new ASU, we 

do not expect to be required to consolidate a material 
amount of additional investment funds (e.g., mutual 
funds, hedge funds, mortgage real estate investment 
funds, private equity funds, and venture capital 
funds).€In addition, we expect to deconsolidate 

substantially all of the CLOs we currently 
consolidate.€The final guidance is effective for reporting periods 
beginning after Dec. 15, 2015. Early adoption is 

permitted, including adoption in an interim period. 
BNY Mellon has not finalized assessing the impact of 

the new standard. ASU - 2014-11 - Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): 
Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase 

Financings, and Disclosures 
In June 2014, the FASB issued an ASU, ﬁTransfers 
and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity 

Transactions, Repurchase Financing, and 

Disclosures,ﬂ which amends the accounting guidance 
for ﬁrepo-to-maturityﬂ transactions and repurchase 
agreements executed as repurchase financings. This 

ASU requires public entities to apply the accounting 
changes and comply with the enhanced disclosure requirements for the first interim or annual reporting 
period beginning after Dec. 15, 2014. However, for 

repurchase and securities lending transactions 
reported as secured borrowings, the ASU™s enhanced 

disclosures are effective for annual periods beginning 

after Dec. 15, 2014 and interim periods beginning 
after March 15, 2015. Early adoption is not 

permitted. ASU - 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU, ﬁRevenue 
from Contracts with Customers,ﬂ which requires an 
entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it 
expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised 
goods or services to customers. The ASU will 

replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in 
U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  The new 

standard is effective for the Company on Jan. 1, 2017.  

Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits 

the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect 

transition method. The Company is evaluating the 

effect that this ASU will have on its consolidated 

financial statements and related disclosures. The 

Company has not yet selected a transition method nor 
has it determined the effect of the standard on its 

ongoing financial reporting. ASU - 2014-08 - Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an 

Entity In April 2014, the FASB issued an ASU, ﬁReporting 
Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of 
Disposals of Components of an Entity,ﬂ which 

changes the criteria for determining which future 
disposals can be presented as discontinued operations 
and modifies related disclosure requirements. This 

ASU is effective for periods beginning on or after 

Dec. 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. 
Proposed Accounting Standards 

Proposed ASU - Leases 

In May 2013, the FASB and the IASB issued a 
revised proposed ASU on leases.  The proposed ASU 

introduces new accounting models for both lessees 
and lessors, primarily to address concerns related to 
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements available to 

lessees under current guidance. The proposal would 

require lessees to account for all leases on the balance  124 BNY Mellon 
Recent Accounting Developments 
(continued) sheet, except for certain short-term leases that have a maximum possible lease term of 12 months or less, 
including any options to renew.  A lessee would 

recognize on its balance sheet (1) an asset for its right 
to use the underlying asset over the lease term and (2) 
a liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments over the lease term. The income statement 

impact for lessees would depend on the nature of the 
underlying asset - that is, whether the underlying 
asset is property or an asset other than property - and 
the terms and conditions of the lease. The proposed 

ASU also introduces new accounting guidance for 
lessors. Lessors would account for leases under 

either the new receivable-and-residual approach or an 
approach similar to current operating-lease 
accounting. The appropriate approach to use would 

depend on the nature of the underlying asset - that is, 
whether the underlying asset is property or an asset 
other than property - and the terms and conditions of 
the lease. If finalized, the proposed ASU would 

converge the most significant aspects of the FASB™s 

and IASB™s accounting for lease contracts.  In March 

2014, the FASB and IASB re-deliberated the ASU 

and were unable to reach a consensus on certain key 
issues. Deliberations are expected to continue over 

the coming months. An effective date is not expected 

before 2018. Proposed ASU - Financial Instruments - Credit 
Losses In December 2012, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses.ﬂ This 

proposed ASU would result in a single model to 

account for credit losses on financial assets. The 

proposal would remove the probable threshold for 
recognizing credit losses and require a current 
estimate of the expected contractual cash flows an 
entity does not expect to collect on financial assets 
that are not measured at fair value through the income 
statement. The proposal would also change current 

practice for recognizing OTTI and interest income on 
debt securities. In addition, the proposal would result 

in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses for 
nearly all types of debt instruments. The proposal 

would expand the credit quality disclosures to require 
information about changes in the factors that 
influence estimates of credit losses and the reasons 
for those changes. The FASB has decided on a 

current expected credit loss model for financial assets 
measured at amortized cost. Currently, the FASB is 

re-deliberating based on comments received. An 

effective date has not been determined. 
Proposed ASU - Recognition and Measurement of 

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In February 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets 

and Financial Liabilities.ﬂ This proposed ASU would 

affect entities that hold financial assets and liabilities 

and would change the methodology related to 
recognition, classification, measurement and 
presentation of financial instruments. The scope of 

the proposed ASU would exclude instruments 

classified in shareholders™ equity, share-based 

arrangements, pension plans, leases, guarantees and 
derivative instruments accounted under ASC 815, 

Derivatives and Hedging. Financial assets would be 

classified and measured based on the instrument™s 

cash flow characteristics and an entity™s business 

model for managing the instrument. Financial 

liabilities would generally be measured initially at 
their transaction price. The proposal includes three 

principal classification and measurement categories: 
(1) fair value for which all changes in fair value are 
recognized in net income; (2) fair value with 
qualifying changes in fair value recognized in other 
comprehensive income; and (3) amortized cost. This 

proposed ASU requires financial assets and liabilities 

to be presented separately on the balance sheet by 
measurement category.  In addition, the fair value of 

financial assets and liabilities accounted for under 
amortized cost would be presented parenthetically on 
the balance sheet. In January 2014, the FASB 

tentatively decided not to continue to pursue the 
business model assessment approach for 
classification and measurement of financial assets. 
The FASB is currently re-deliberating based on the 

comments received and is expected to issue a final 
standard in mid-2015. An effective date is not 

expected before 2017. Adoption of new accounting standards 

For a discussion of the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. IFRS 
IFRS are a set of standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB. Commencing with the 

issuance of the ﬁroadmapﬂ in November 2008, the 
SEC has considered potential methods of 
incorporation of IFRS in the United States. The use 

of IFRS for U.S. companies with global operations BNY Mellon 125 
Recent Accounting Developments 
(continued)would allow for streamlined reporting, allow for easier access to foreign capital markets and 
investments, and facilitate cross-border acquisitions, 
ventures or spin-offs.  
In July 2012, the SEC staff released its final report on 
IFRS. This Final Report will be used by the SEC 

Commissioners to decide whether and, if so, when 
and how to incorporate IFRS into the financial 
reporting system for U.S. companies. It is not known 

when the SEC will make a final decision on the 
adoption of IFRS in the United States. While the SEC decides whether IFRS will be required to be used in the preparation of our consolidated 
financial statements, a number of countries have 
mandated the use of IFRS by BNY Mellon™s 

subsidiaries in their statutory reports filed in those 
countries. Such countries include Belgium, Brazil, 

the Netherlands, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada and 

South Korea. Update to Internal Controls - Integrated Framework 

On May 14, 2013, COSO issued an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework (the 
ﬁ2013 Frameworkﬂ). Originally issued in 1992, the 

framework helps organizations design, implement 

and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls.  

Updates to the framework were intended to clarify 
internal control concepts and simplify their use and 
application. The 1992 framework remained available 

during the transition period, which extended to Dec. 
15, 2014. Concurrent with the 2013 Framework 

release, COSO indicated that organizations reporting 

externally should clearly disclose whether the original 
Framework or the updated Framework was utilized. 
BNY Mellon utilizes the COSO 2013 Framework for 

our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  126 BNY Mellon 
Business Continuity We are prepared for events that could damage our 
physical facilities, cause delay or disruptions to 
operational functions, including telecommunications 
networks, or impair our employees, clients, vendors 
and counterparties. Key elements of our business 

continuity strategies are extensive planning and 
testing, and diversity of business operations, data 
centers and telecommunications infrastructure. We have established multiple geographically diverse 
locations for our funds transfer and broker-dealer 

services operational units, which provide redundant 
functionality to facilitate uninterrupted operations. Our securities clearing, commercial paper, mutual 
fund accounting and custody, securities lending, 

master trust, Unit Investment Trust, corporate trust, 

item processing, wealth management and treasury 
units have common functionality in multiple sites 
designed to facilitate continuance of operations or 
rapid recovery.  In addition, we have recovery 

positions for over 12,700 employees on a global basis 
of which over 6,800 are proprietary. 
We continue to enhance geographic diversity for 
business operations by moving additional personnel 
to growth centers outside of existing major urban 
centers. We replicate 100% of our critical production 

computer data to multiple recovery data centers. We have an active telecommunications diversity 
program. All major buildings and data centers have 

diverse telecommunications carriers, where available. 
The data centers have multiple fiber optic rings and 
have been designed so that there is no single point of 
failure. All major buildings have been designed with diverse telecommunications access, where available, and 
connect to at least two geographically dispersed 
connection points. We have an active program to 

audit circuits for route diversity and to test customer 
back-up connections. In 2003, the Federal Reserve, OCC and SEC jointly published the Interagency Paper, ﬁSound Practices to 

Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial 
Systemﬂ (ﬁSound Practices Paperﬂ). The purpose of 

the document was to define the guidelines for the 
financial services industry and other interested parties 
regarding ﬁbest practicesﬂ related to business 
continuity planning. Under these guidelines, we are a 
key clearing and settlement organization required to 

meet a higher standard for business continuity. 
We believe we meet substantially all of the 
requirements of the Sound Practices Paper.  As a core 

clearing and settlement organization, we believe that 

we are at the forefront of the industry in improving 
business continuity practices. We are committed to seeing that requirements for 
business continuity are met not just within our own 
facilities, but also within those of vendors and service 
providers whose operation is critical to our safety and 
soundness. To that end, we have a Vendor Risk 

Management Office whose function is to review new 

and existing service providers and vendors to see that 
they meet our standards for business continuity, as 

well as for information security, financial stability, 

and personnel practices, etc. We have developed a comprehensive plan to prepare 
for the possibility of a flu pandemic, which 
anticipates significant reduced staffing levels and will 

provide for increased remote working by staff for one 

or more periods lasting several weeks. Although we are committed to observing best practices as well as meeting regulatory requirements, 
geopolitical uncertainties and other external factors 
will continue to create risk that cannot always be 
identified and anticipated. Due to BNY Mellon™s robust business recovery 
systems and processes, we are not materially 
impacted by climate change, nor do we expect 
material impacts in the near term. We have, and will 

continue to, implement processes and capital projects 
to deal with the risks of the changing climate. The 

Company has invested in the development of 
products and services that support the markets related 
to climate change. BNY Mellon 127 
   Supplemental Information (unaudited)Supplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures 
BNY Mellon has included in this Annual Report 
certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon 

fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based 
capital ratios, SLR, Basel I CET1 and tangible 
common shareholders™ equity.  BNY Mellon believes 

that the Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital 
ratios on a fully phased-in basis, the SLR on a fully 
phased-in basis, the ratio of Basel I CET1 to risk-
weighted assets and the ratio of tangible common 
shareholders™ equity to tangible assets of operations 

are measures of capital strength that provide 
additional useful information to investors, 
supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, 
utilized by regulatory authorities. The tangible 

common shareholders™ equity ratio includes changes 

in investment securities valuations which are 
reflected in total shareholders™ equity.  In addition, 

this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual 
book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a 
risk-based reduced value established in accordance 
with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon 

in its reconciliation has excluded certain assets which 
are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory 
purposes and the assets of consolidated investment 
management funds to which BNY Mellon has limited 

economic exposure. Further, BNY Mellon believes 

that the return on tangible common equity measure, 
which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of 
deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure 
for investors because it presents a measure of those 
assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has 

provided a measure of tangible book value per share, 
which it believes provides additional useful 
information as to the level of such assets in relation to 
shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which 
exclude the effect of net securities gains, 

noncontrolling interests related to consolidated 
investment management funds, a gain on the sale of 
our investment in Wing Hang and a gain on the sale 

of the One Wall Street building; and expense 

measures which exclude M&I expenses, litigation 
charges, restructuring charges, the charge related to 

investment management funds, net of incentives, and 

amortization of intangible assets. Earnings per share, 

return on equity measures and operating margin 

measures, which exclude some or all of these items, 
are also presented. Earnings per share and return on 

equity measures also exclude the tax benefit benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim and the net 
charge related to the disallowance of certain foreign 

tax credits. Operating margin measures may also 

exclude amortization of intangible assets and the net 
negative impact of money market fee waivers, net of 
distribution and servicing expense. BNY Mellon 

believes that these measures are useful to investors 
because they permit a focus on period-to-period 
comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY 
Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in 
circumstances where such matters are within BNY 
Mellon™s control.  The excluded items, in general, 

relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior 

transactions or where we have incurred charges.  

M&I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and 
generally continue for approximately three years after 
the transaction. M&I expenses can vary on a year

year basis depending on the stage of the integration. 
BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion of M&I 

expenses provides investors with a focus on BNY 
Mellon™s business as it would appear on a 

consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I 
expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect 

such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily 
compared to our current results if M&I expenses are 
excluded. Litigation charges represent accruals for 

loss contingencies that are both probable and 
reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-
related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our 

streamlining actions, Operational Excellence 
Initiatives and migrating positions to Global Delivery 
Centers. Excluding these charges permits investors to 

view expenses on a basis consistent with how 
management views the business. The presentation of income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income 
attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the 
consolidation of certain investment management 
funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis 
consistent with how management views the business. 
BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a 

supplement to GAAP information, give investors a 

clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. In this Annual Report, the net interest margin is 
presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this 

presentation provides comparability of amounts 
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, 
and is consistent with industry practice. The 

adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net 
income. Each of these measures as described above 

is used by management to monitor financial  128 BNY Mellon

Capital Ratios BNY Mellon has presented its estimated fully phased-
in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios 
and SLR based on its interpretation of the Final 
Capital Rules, which are being gradually phased-in 
over a multi-year period, as supplemented by the Federal Reserve™s final rules concerning the SLR 
published on Sept. 3, 2014, and on the application of 
such rules to BNY Mellon™s businesses as currently 

conducted. Management views the estimated fully 

phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon™s capital position and progress against future 

regulatory capital standards. Additionally, the 

presentation of the estimated fully phased-in Basel III 
CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies. The 

estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other 
risk-based capital ratios assume all relevant 
regulatory approvals. The Final Capital Rules require 
approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations. If 

these models are not approved, the estimated fully 
phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital 
ratios would likely be adversely impacted. Risk-weighted assets at Dec. 31, 2014 for credit risk under the transitional Advanced Approach do not 
reflect the use of a simple value-at-risk methodology 
for repo-style transactions (including agented 
indemnified securities lending transactions), eligible 
margin loans, and similar transactions.  BNY Mellon 

has requested written approval to use this methodology. 
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY Mellon™s further review of 

applicable rules, anticipated compliance with all 
necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of risk-weighted asset calculations, other refinements, 
further implementation guidance from regulators, 
market practices and standards and any changes BNY 
Mellon may make to its businesses. Consequently, 
our capital ratios remain subject to ongoing review and revision and may change based on these factors. The following are the primary differences between 
risk-weighted assets determined under fully phased-in 
Basel III-Standardized Approach and Basel I.  Credit 
risk is determined under Basel I using predetermined risk-weights and asset classes and relies in part on the 
use of external credit ratings. Under fully phased-in 

Basel III, the Standardized Approach uses a broader 
range of predetermined risk-weights and asset classes and certain alternatives to external credit ratings.  132 BNY Mellon 
      Supplemental Information (unaudited) (continued) Securitization exposure receives a higher risk-approach but requires certain model qualifications weighting under fully phased-in Basel III than Basel and approvals, for determining risk-weighted assets 
I, and fully phased-in Basel III includes additional on certain repo-style transactions. In 2014, 
adjustments for market risk, counterparty credit risk Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach risk-
and equity exposures. Additionally, the Standardized weighted assets include transitional adjustments for 

Approach eliminates the use of the VaR approach, intangible assets, other than goodwill, and equity 

whereas the Advanced Approach permits the VaR exposures. 
The table presented below compares the fully phased-in Basel III capital components and ratios to those amounts determined under the currently effective rules using the transitional phase-in requirements.

 Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement of BNY Mellon is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting for BNY Mellon, as 

such term is defined in Rule€13a-15(f) under the 
Exchange Act. 
BNY Mellon™s management, including its principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, has 

assessed the effectiveness of BNY Mellon™s internal 

control over financial reporting as of December€31, 
2014.  In making this assessment, management used 
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). 
Based upon such assessment, management believes 
that, as of December€31, 2014, BNY Mellon™s 

internal control over financial reporting is effective 

based upon those criteria. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public 
accounting firm that audited BNY Mellon™s 2014 

financial statements included in this Annual Report 

under ﬁFinancial Statements and Notes,ﬂ has issued a 
report with respect to the effectiveness of BNY 

Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting.  

This report appears on page 145.

   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation™s (ﬁBNY Mellonﬂ) internal control over financial 
reporting as of December€31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment 

of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of 

Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on BNY 

Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit 

included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 

assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 

circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal control over financial reporting 

includes those policies and procedures that (1)€pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)€provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)€provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s 

assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 

become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, BNY Mellon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December€31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States), the consolidated balance sheets of BNY Mellon as of December€31, 2014 and 2013, and the related 

consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years 

in the three-year period ended December€31, 2014, and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified 
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York

   Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1 - Summary of significant accounting and reporting policies Basis of presentation 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY Mellon, a global financial services company, 

conform to U.S. GAAP and prevailing industry 

practices. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows for the periods have been made. These financial statements should 
be read in conjunction with BNY Mellon™s Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 
2014.  Certain immaterial reclassifications have been 
made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with current period presentation. In 2014, BNY Mellon elected to early adopt the new 
accounting guidance included in ASU 2014-01, 

ﬁAccounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable 

Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB 

Emerging Issues Task Force.ﬂ  As a result, we 

restated the prior period financial statements to reflect 
the impact of the retrospective application of the new 
accounting guidance. See Note 2 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make 

estimates based upon assumptions about future 
economic and market conditions which affect 

reported amounts and related disclosures in our 
financial statements. Although our current estimates 

contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible 
that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated 
in those estimates, which could materially affect our 

results of operations and financial condition. 
Amounts subject to estimates are items such as the 
allowance for loan losses and lending-related 
commitments, the fair value of financial instruments 
and other-than-temporary impairments, goodwill and 

intangible assets and pension accounting. Among 

other effects, such changes in estimates could result 

in future impairments of investment securities, 
goodwill and intangible assets and establishment of 
allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments as well as changes in pension and post-
retirement expense. Subsequent event 
As disclosed in February 2015, our financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014 were 

impacted by an additional after-tax litigation expense 

of $598 million in anticipation of the resolution of 

several previously disclosed matters, including 
substantially all of the foreign exchange-related 
actions. This impact has been reflected throughout 

these financial statements as a result of developments 
in our litigation that occurred subsequent to Dec. 31, 

2014 which required that we increase our estimated 
accrual for probable and reasonably estimable losses.€
In addition, these developments resulted in a 
substantial decline in our aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings as of 
Dec. 31, 2014.€ See Note 22 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. Equity method investments The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries.  Equity 

investments of less than a majority but at least 20% 

ownership are accounted for by the equity method 
and classified as other assets. Earnings on these 

investments are reflected in fee and other revenue as 
investment services fees, investment management and 
performance fees or investment and other income, as 
appropriate, in the period earned. A loss in value of an equity investment that is 
determined to be other-than-temporary, is recognized 

by reducing the carrying value of the equity 
investment down to its fair value. Our most significant equity method investments are: Equity method investments at Dec. 31, 2014 Percentage(dollars in millions) ownership Book€value CIBC Mellon 50.0% $ 550

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Acquired businesses 
The income statement and balance sheet include results of acquired businesses accounted for under the 
acquisition method of accounting pursuant to ASC 

805, Business Combinations and equity investments 
from the dates of acquisition. For acquisitions 

completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we record the fair 
value of any contingent payments as an additional 
cost of the equity acquired in the period that the 
payment becomes probable. For acquisitions 

completed after Jan. 1, 2009, contingent purchase 
consideration was measured at its fair value and 
recorded on the purchase date. Any subsequent 

changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration 
liability will be recorded through the income 
statement. Parent financial statements 

The Parent financial statements in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include 
the accounts of the Parent; those of a wholly-owned 
financing subsidiary that functions as a financing 
entity for BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries; and 

MIPA, LLC, a single-member limited liability 

company, created to hold and administer corporate-

owned life insurance. Financial data for the Parent, 

the financing subsidiary and the single-member 
limited liability company are combined for financial 
reporting purposes because of the limited function of 
these entities and the unconditional guarantee by 
BNY Mellon of their obligations. 
Nature of operations 

BNY Mellon is a global leader in providing a broad 
range of financial products and services in domestic 
and international markets. Through our two principal 

businesses, Investment Management and Investment 
Services, we serve the following major classes of 
customers - institutions, corporations, and high net 
worth individuals. For institutions and corporations, 

we provide the following services: Ł investment management; Ł trust and custody; Ł foreign exchange; Ł fund administration; Ł global collateral services; Ł securities lending; Ł depositary receipts; Ł corporate trust; Ł global payment/cash management; Ł banking services; and Ł clearing services. For individuals, we provide mutual funds, separate accounts, wealth management and private banking 
services. BNY Mellon™s investment management 

businesses provide investment products in many asset 
classes and investment styles on a global basis. Variable interest entities 

Accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs is 
included in ASC 810 Consolidation, ASU 2009-17 

ﬁImprovements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises 
Involved with Variable Interest Entitiesﬂ, and ASU 

2010-10 ﬁAmendments for Certain Investment 
Funds,ﬂ which defers ASU 2009-17 for certain asset 

managers™ interests in entities that apply the 

specialized accounting guidance for investment 
companies or that have the attributes of investment 
companies and for interests in money market funds. VIEs are defined as certain entities in which the equity investors: Ł do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity 

to finance its activities without additional 
subordinated financial support; or Ł lack one or more of the following characteristics of 
a controlling financial interest: Ł the power, through voting rights or similar 

rights, to direct the activities of an entity that 
most significantly impact the entity™s economic 

performance (ASU 2009-17 model). Ł the direct or indirect ability to make decisions 
about the entity™s activities through voting 

rights or similar rights (ASC 810 model). Ł the obligation to absorb the expected losses of 
the entity. 
Ł the right to receive the expected residual 
returns of the entity.
We consider the underlying facts and circumstances 

of individual transactions when assessing whether or 
not an entity is a VIE.  BNY Mellon is required to 

consolidate a VIE if BNY Mellon is determined to be 

the primary beneficiary. 
As a result of ASU 2010-10, BNY Mellon continues 
to apply ASC 810 to its mutual funds, hedge funds, 

private equity funds, collective investment funds and 
real estate investment trusts. If these entities are 
BNY Mellon 155 
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)determined to be VIEs, primary beneficiary 
calculations are prepared in accordance with ASC 

810 to determine whether or not BNY Mellon is the 

primary beneficiary and required to consolidate the 
VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party 

that absorbs a majority of the VIE™s expected losses, 

receives a majority of its expected residual returns or 
both. BNY Mellon has two securitizations and several 
CLOs, which are assessed for consolidation in 
accordance with ASU 2009-17.  The primary 

beneficiary of these VIE™s is the party that has both: 

(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that 

most significantly impact that entity™s economic 

performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses, 
or the right to receive benefits, from the VIE that 

could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
Voting interest entities 

If BNY Mellon can exert control over the financial 
and operating policies of an investee, which generally 
can occur if there is a 50% or more voting interest or 

if partners or members of an investee do not have 
certain substantive rights, BNY Mellon consolidates 

the investee. Investees structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which BNY Mellon is either 

the general partner or managing member are 
presumed to be controlled by BNY Mellon.  In 

accordance with ASC 810-20 
Control of Partnerships 

and Similar Entities, we review the rights of the limited partners and members to determine whether 
that presumption can be overcome. The presumption 

of control is overcome when the limited partners or 
managing members have the ability to dissolve the 
entity, can remove BNY Mellon, as the general 

partner or managing member without cause based on 
a simple majority vote of unaffiliated limited partners 

or members or have other substantive participating 
rights. If the presumption of control is not overcome, 

the entity is consolidated. Trading account securities, available-for-sale 
securities, and held-to-maturity securities Securities are accounted for under ASC 320 
Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Securities are classified in the trading, available-for-sale 

investment or the held-to-maturity investment 
securities portfolios when they are purchased. Securities are classified as trading securities when our 
intention is to resell the securities. Securities are 

classified as available-for-sale securities when we 

intend to hold the securities for an indefinite period of 
time or when the securities may be used for tactical 
asset/liability purposes and may be sold from time to 
time to effectively manage interest rate exposure, 

prepayment risk and liquidity needs. Securities are 

classified as held-to-maturity securities when we 
intend to hold them until maturity.  
Trading securities are stated at fair value.  Trading 
revenue includes both realized and unrealized gains 
and losses. The liability incurred on short-sale 

transactions, representing the obligation to deliver 
securities, is included in trading liabilities at fair 
value. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value.  
The difference between fair value and amortized cost 

representing unrealized gains or losses on assets 
classified as available-for-sale, are recorded net of tax 

as an addition to or deduction from OCI, unless a 
security is deemed to have OTTI. Gains and losses 

on sales of available-for-sale securities are reported in 

the income statement. The cost of debt and equity 

securities sold is determined on a specific 
identification and average cost method, respectively.  

Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized 
cost. Income on investment securities purchased is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion 
of discount on a level yield basis. We routinely conduct periodic reviews to identify and 
evaluate each investment security to determine 
whether OTTI has occurred. We examine various 

factors when determining whether an impairment, 
representing the fair value of a security being below 
its amortized cost, is other than temporary.  The 

following are examples of factors that BNY Mellon 

considers: Ł The length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost 
basis; Ł Whether management has an intent to sell the 
security; Ł Whether the decline in fair value is attributable to 
specific adverse conditions affecting a particular 

investment;  156 BNY Mellon 
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Ł Whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific conditions, such as conditions in an 
industry or in a geographic area; Ł Whether a debt security has been downgraded by 
a rating agency; Ł Whether a debt security exhibits cash flow 
deterioration; and Ł For each non-agency RMBS, we compare the 
remaining credit enhancement that protects the 
individual security from losses against the 
projected losses of principal and/or interest 
expected to come from the underlying mortgage 
collateral, to determine whether such credit losses 
might directly impact the relevant security. 
When we do not intend to sell the security and it is 
more likely than not that BNY Mellon will not be 

required to sell the security prior to recovery of its 
cost basis, the credit component of an OTTI of a debt 
security is recognized in earnings and the non-credit 
component is recognized in OCI The determination of whether a credit loss exists is based on best estimates of the present value of cash 
flows to be collected from the debt security.  

Generally, cash flows are discounted at the effective 

interest rate implicit in the debt security at the time of 
acquisition. For debt securities that are beneficial 

interests in securitized financial assets and are not 
high credit quality, ASC 325 provides that cash flows 

be discounted at the current yield used to accrete the 
beneficial interest. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that BNY Mellon will be required to sell the 


credit component of OTTI is recognized in earnings 
and subsequently accreted to interest income on an 
effective yield basis over the life of the security. 
For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of OTTI recorded in OCI for the non-credit portion of a 
previous OTTI is amortized prospectively, as an 

increase to the carrying amount of the security, over 

the remaining life of the security on the basis of the 
timing of future estimated cash flows of the 
securities. The accounting policies for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and OTTI have 
been identified as ﬁcritical accounting estimatesﬂ as 
they require us to make numerous assumptions based 
on available market data. See Note 4 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements for these 
disclosures. Loans and leases 
Loans are reported net of any unearned income and deferred fees and costs. Certain loan origination and 

upfront commitment fees, as well as certain direct 
loan origination and commitment costs, are deferred 
and amortized as a yield adjustment over the lives of 
the related loans. Loans held for sale are carried at 

the lower of cost or fair value. Unearned revenue on direct financing leases is accreted over the lives of the leases in decreasing 
amounts to provide a constant rate of return on the net 
investment in the leases. Revenue on leveraged 

leases is recognized on a basis to achieve a constant 
yield on the outstanding investment in the lease, net 
of the related deferred tax liability, in the years in 

which the net investment is positive. Gains and 

losses on residual values of leased equipment sold are 
included in investment and other income. 
Considering the nature of these leases and the number 
of significant assumptions, there is risk associated 
with the income recognition on these leases should 
any of the assumptions change materially in future 
periods. A modified loan is considered a TDR if the debtor is 
experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor 

grants a concession to the debtor that would not 
otherwise be considered.€A TDR may include a 

transfer of real estate or other assets from the debtor 
to the creditor, or a modification of the term of the 

loan. TDRs are accounted for as impaired loans (see 

the Nonperforming assets policy). Nonperforming assets 
Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or 

more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest 
or principal will be collected. When a first lien residential mortgage loan reaches 90 
days delinquent, it is subject to an impairment test 
and may be placed on nonaccrual status. At 180 days 

delinquent, the loan is subject to further impairment 
testing. The loan will remain on accrual status if the 

realizable value of the collateral exceeds the unpaid 
principal balance plus accrued interest. If the loan is 

impaired, a charge-off is taken and the loan is placed 
BNY Mellon 157 
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)on nonaccrual status. At 270 days delinquent, all first 
lien mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status. 
Second lien mortgages are automatically placed on 
nonaccrual status when they reach 90 days 

delinquent. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is 
reversed against current period interest revenue. 
Interest receipts on nonaccrual and impaired loans are 
recognized as interest revenue or are applied to 
principal when we believe the ultimate collectability 
of principal is in doubt. Nonaccrual loans generally 

are restored to an accrual basis when principal and 
interest become current and remain current for a 
specified period. A loan is considered to be impaired when it is 
probable that we will be unable to collect all principal 
and interest amounts due according to the contractual 
terms of the loan agreement. An impairment 

allowance on loans $1 million or greater is required 

to be measured based upon the loan™s market price, 

the present value of expected future cash flows, 
discounted at the loan™s initial effective interest rate, 

or at fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral 
dependent. If the loan valuation is less than the 

recorded value of the loan, an impairment allowance 
is established by a provision for credit loss. 
Impairment allowances are not needed when the 
recorded investment in an impaired loan is less than 
the loan valuation. Allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments 
The allowance for loan losses, shown as a valuation allowance to loans, and the allowance for lending-
related commitments recorded in other liabilities are 
referred to as BNY Mellon™s allowance for credit 

losses. The accounting policy for the determination 

of the adequacy of the allowances has been identified 
as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it requires us to 
make numerous complex and subjective estimates 
and assumptions relating to amounts which are 
inherently uncertain. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance 
sheet date based on our judgment. The allowance 

determination methodology is designed to provide 
procedural discipline in assessing the appropriateness 
of the allowance. Credit losses are charged against 
the allowance. Recoveries are added to the 

allowance. The methodology for determining the allowance for lending-related commitments considers the same 
factors as the allowance for loan losses, as well as an 
estimate of the probability of drawdown. We utilize a 

quantitative methodology and qualitative framework 
for determining the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments. Within 

this qualitative framework, management applies 
judgment when assessing internal risk factors and 
environmental factors to compute an additional 
allowance for each component of the loan portfolio. The three elements of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments 
include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: Ł an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million 

or greater; Ł an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits; and Ł an allowance for residential mortgage loans. Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. 
As a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 

million.  Therefore, the first element, impaired 

credits, is based on individual analysis of all impaired 
loans of $1 million and greater.  The allowance is 

measured by the difference between the recorded 

value of impaired loans and their impaired value. 
Impaired value is either the present value of the 
expected future cash flows from the borrower, the 

market value of the loan, or the fair value of the 
collateral. The second element, higher risk-rated credits and pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 
model. Individual credit analyses are performed on 

such loans before being assigned a credit rating. All 

borrowers are assigned to pools based on their credit 
rating. The probable loss inherent in each loan in a 

pool incorporates the borrower™s credit rating, loss 

given default rating and maturity.  The loss given 

default incorporates a recovery expectation and an 
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage 
given default). The borrower™s probability of default 

is derived from the associated credit rating. Borrower 

ratings are reviewed at least annually and are 
periodically mapped to third-party databases, 
including rating agency and default and recovery  158 BNY Mellon 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) databases, to ensure ongoing consistency and validity.  
Higher risk-rated credits are reviewed quarterly.  In 

the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the probable 
loss model to calculate the allowance for the Wealth 

Management mortgage portfolio. In prior periods, 

the allowance was calculated using a delinquency 
pool approach as described below in the third element 
for the allowance for residential mortgage loans. The third element, the allowance for residential mortgage loans, is determined by segregating five 

mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging 
from current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 
default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. BNY Mellon assigns all 

residential mortgage pools, except home equity lines 
of credit, a probability of default and loss given 
default based on default and loss data derived from 
internal historical data related to our residential 
mortgage portfolio. The resulting probable loss 

factor (the probability of default multiplied by the 
loss given default) is applied against the loan balance 
to determine the allowance held for each pool. For 

home equity lines of credit, probability of default and 
loss given default are based on external data from 
third-party databases due to the small size of the 
portfolio and insufficient internal data. 
The qualitative framework is used to determine an additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 
factors below: Internal risk factors: 
Ł Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Ł Criticized assets to total loans and lending-related commitments; Ł Ratings volatility; Ł Borrower concentration; and Ł Significant concentration in high risk industries. Environmental risk factors: Ł U.S. non-investment grade default rate; Ł Unemployment rate; and Ł Change in real GDP The objective of the qualitative framework is to capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 
captured in the quantitative reserve, which is based 
primarily on historical data. Management determines 

the qualitative allowance each period based on judgment informed by consideration of internal and 
external risk factors and other considerations that 
may be deemed relevant during the period. Once 

determined in the aggregate, our qualitative 
allowance is then allocated to each of our loan classes 
based on the respective classes™ quantitative 

allowance balances with the allocations adjusted, 
when necessary, for class specific risk factors.  
For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to 
evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 
The distribution of historical experience is compared 
to the risk factor™s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the 
portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 
relative to our historical experience. Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level - no impact, low, moderate, high and elevated - to each 

risk factor for the current quarter.  Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine 
an aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the 

impact of any particular risk factor.  Management™s 

assessment of the risk factors, as well as the trend in 
the quantitative allowance, supports management™s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 
allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 
reflected incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. A greater qualitative allowance 

may be required if our quantitative allowance does 
not yet reflect the incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. The allocation of allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
regardless of the nature of the loss. Premises and equipment 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, 
over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased 
facility or the estimated economic life of the 
improvement. For owned and capitalized assets, 

estimated useful lives range from 2 to 40 years.  

Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as 

incurred, while major improvements are capitalized BNY Mellon 159 
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)and amortized to operating expense over their identified useful lives. Software 

BNY Mellon capitalizes costs relating to acquired 
software and internal-use software development 
projects that provide new or significantly improved 
functionality.  We capitalize projects that are expected 

to result in longer-term operational benefits, such as 

replacement systems or new applications that result in 
significantly increased operational efficiencies or 

functionality.  All other costs incurred in connection 

with an internal-use software project are expensed as 
incurred. Capitalized software is recorded in other 

assets. Identified intangible assets and goodwill 
Identified intangible assets with estimable lives are amortized in a pattern consistent with the assets™ 
identifiable cash flows or using a straight-line method 
over their remaining estimated benefit periods if the 
pattern of cash flows is not estimable. Intangible 

assets with estimable lives are reviewed for possible 
impairment when events or changed circumstances 
may affect the underlying basis of the asset.  

Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not 
amortized, but are assessed annually for impairment, 
or more often if events and circumstances indicate it 
is more likely than not they may be impaired. The 

accounting policy for valuing and impairment testing 
of identified intangible assets and goodwill has been 
identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it 
requires us to make numerous complex and 
subjective estimates. See Note 6 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
disclosures related to goodwill and intangible assets. Seed capital 
Seed capital investments are classified as other assets and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses 

on seed capital investments are recorded in 
investment and other income. Noncontrolling interests 

Noncontrolling interests included in permanent equity are adjusted for the income or (loss) attributable to 
the noncontrolling interest holders and any 
distributions to those shareholders. Redeemable 

noncontrolling interests are reported as temporary equity.  BNY Mellon recognizes changes in the 

redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling 
interests as they occur and adjusts the carrying value 
to be equal to the redemption value. Fee revenue 

We record investment services fees, investment 
management fees, foreign exchange and other trading 
revenue, financing-related fees, distribution and 
servicing, and other revenue when the services are 
provided and earned based on contractual terms, 
when amounts are determined and collectability is 
reasonably assured. Additionally
refundable, upfront implementation fees under 
outsourcing contracts using a straight-line method, 
commencing in the period the ongoing services are 
performed through the expected term of the 
contractual relationship. Incremental direct set-up 

costs of implementation, up to the related 
implementation fee or minimum fee revenue amount, 
are deferred and amortized over the same period that 
the related implementation fees are recognized. If a 

client terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely, 

the unamortized deferred incremental direct set-up 
costs and the unamortized deferred up-front 
implementation fees related to that contract are 
recognized in the period the contract is terminated. Performance fees are recognized in the period in which the performance fees are earned and become 
determinable. Performance fees are generally 

calculated as a percentage of the applicable 
portfolio™s performance in excess of a benchmark 

index or a peer group™s performance.  When a 

portfolio underperforms its benchmark or fails to 
generate positive performance, subsequent years™ 
performance must generally exceed this shortfall 
prior to fees being earned. Amounts billable, which 

are subject to a clawback if future performance 
thresholds in current or future years are not met, are 
not recognized since the fees are potentially 
uncollectible. These fees are recognized when it is 

determined that they will be collected. When a multi-

year performance contract provides that fees earned 
are billed ratably over the performance period, only 
the portion of the fees earned that are non-refundable 
are recognized.  160 BNY Mellon 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Net interest revenue 
Revenue on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities is recognized based on the 
effective yield of the related financial instrument. 
Foreign currency translation 

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the rate of 
exchange on the balance sheet date. Transaction 

gains and losses are included in the income statement. 
Translation gains and losses on investments in foreign 

entities with functional currencies that are not the 
U.S. dollar are recorded as foreign currency 
translation adjustments in other comprehensive 
income (loss). Revenue and expense transactions are 

translated at the applicable daily rate or the weighted 
average monthly exchange rate when applying the 
daily rate is not practical. Pension 
The measurement date for BNY Mellon™s pension 
plans is Dec. 31. Plan assets are determined based on 

fair value generally representing observable market 
prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined 

based on the present value of projected benefit 
distributions at an assumed discount rate. The 

discount rate utilized is based on the yield curves of 
high-quality corporate bonds available in the 
marketplace. The net periodic pension expense or 

credit includes service costs, interest costs based on 
an assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan 
assets based on an actuarially derived market-related 
value and amortization of prior years™ actuarial gains 

and losses. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, gains or losses related to changes in the 
amount of the projected benefit obligation or plan 
assets resulting from experience different from the 

assumed rate of return, changes in the discount rate or 
other assumptions. To the extent an actuarial gain or 

loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected 
benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan 
assets, the excess is recognized over the future 
service periods of active employees. As a result of an 

amendment adopted on Jan. 29, 2015 to freeze benefit 
accrual under the U.S. pension plans effective Jun. 

30, 2015, future unrecognized actuarial gains and 
losses for the U.S. plans that exceed a threshold 
amount will be amortized over the average future life expectancy of plan participants with a maximum of 
15 years. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated returns for each applicable 
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the 

expected allocation for each asset class and are based 
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and 

term historical returns for these markets. We also 

consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global 
economies, as well as current and prospective interest 
rates. The market-related value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair 
value of plan assets adjusted for the difference 

between expected returns and actual performance of 
plan assets. The difference between actual experience 

and expected returns on plan assets is included as an 
adjustment in the market-related value over a five-

year period. BNY Mellon™s accounting policy regarding pensions 
has been identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ 
as it requires management to make numerous 
complex and subjective assumptions relating to 
amounts which are inherently uncertain. See Note 18 

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional disclosures related to pensions. Severance 
BNY
based employees through The Bank of New York 

Mellon Corporation Supplemental Unemployment 
Benefit Plan. These benefits are provided to eligible 

employees separated from their jobs for business 
reasons not related to individual performance. Basic 

separation benefits are generally based on the 
employee™s years of continuous benefited service.  

Severance for employees based outside of the U.S. is 
determined in accordance with local agreements and 
legal requirements. Severance expense is recorded 

when management commits to an action that will 
result in separation and the amount of the liability can 
be reasonably estimated. Income taxes 
We record current tax liabilities or assets through 
charges or credits to the current tax provision for the 

estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current BNY Mellon 161 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)year.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 
for future tax consequences attributable to differences 

between the financial statement carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 

expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax 

valuation allowance is established if it is more likely 
than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 
will not be realized. A tax position that fails to meet a 

more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will result 
in either reduction of current or deferred tax assets, 
and/or recording of current or deferred tax liabilities. 
Interest and penalties related to income taxes are 
recorded as income tax expense. Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative contracts, such as futures contracts, forwards, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps 
and options and similar products used in trading 
activities are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses 

are included in foreign exchange and other trading 
revenue in fee and other revenue. Unrealized gains 

are recognized as trading assets and unrealized losses 
are recognized as trading liabilities, after taking into 
consideration master netting agreements. We enter into various derivative financial instruments 
for non-trading purposes primarily as part of our 
ALM process. These derivatives are designated as 

either fair value or cash flow hedges of certain assets 
and liabilities when we enter into the derivative 
contracts. Gains and losses associated with fair value 

hedges are recorded in income as well as any change 
in the value of the related hedged item associated 
with the designated risks being hedged. Gains and 

losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI, until 
reclassified into earnings in the same period the 
hedged item impacts earnings. Foreign currency 

transaction gains and losses related to a hedged net 
investment in a foreign operation, net of their tax 
effect, are recorded with cumulative foreign currency 

translation adjustments within OCI. We formally document all relationships between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our 
risk-management objectives and strategy for 
undertaking various hedging transactions. We formally assess, both at the hedge™s inception and 
on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective and 

whether those derivatives are expected to remain 
highly effective in future periods.  At inception, the 

potential causes of ineffectiveness related to each of 

our hedges is assessed to determine if we can expect 
the hedge to be highly effective over the life of the 

transaction and to determine the method for 
evaluating effectiveness on an ongoing basis. 
Recognizing that changes in the value of derivatives used for hedging or the value of hedged items could 
result in significant ineffectiveness, we have 

processes in place that are designed to identify and 
evaluate such changes when they occur.  Quarterly, 

we perform a quantitative effectiveness assessment 

and record any ineffectiveness in current earnings. 
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when 
we determine that a derivative is no longer an 
effective hedge, the derivative expires, is sold, or 

management discontinues the derivative™s hedge 

designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these 

derivatives are included in foreign exchange and 
other trading revenue. For discontinued fair value 

hedges, the accumulated gain or loss on the hedged 
item is amortized on a yield basis over the remaining 
life of the hedged item. Accumulated gains and 

losses, net of tax effect, from discontinued cash flow 

hedges are reclassified from OCI and recognized in 
current earnings in foreign exchange and other 
trading revenue as the hedged item impacts earnings. 
The accounting policy for the determination of the 
fair value of derivative financial instruments has been 
identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it 
requires us to make numerous assumptions based on 
the available market data. See Note 23 of the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
disclosures related to derivative financial instruments. Statement of cash flows 
We have defined cash as cash and due from banks.  
Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in 
the same category as the items hedged. Stock-based compensation 
Compensation expense relating to all share-based payments is recognized in the income statement, on a 
straight-line basis, over the applicable vesting period. Certain of our stock compensation grants vest when the employee retires. New grants with this feature are 
 162 BNY Mellon 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) expensed by the first date the employee is eligible to retire. Note 2 - Accounting changes and new 
accounting guidance ASU - 2014-01 - Accounting for Investments in 
Qualified Affordable Housing Projects - a Consensus 

of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force 
In January 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-01, 
ﬁAccounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable 

Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB 

Emerging Issues Task Force.ﬂ  This ASU permits 

entities that invest in a qualified affordable housing 

project through a limited liability entity to make an 
accounting policy election to account for investments 
using the proportional amortization method if certain 
conditions are met. Under the proportional 
amortization method, the initial cost of the investment 
is amortized in proportion to the tax credits and other 
tax benefits received and the net investment 
performance is recognized in the income statement as 
a component of income tax expense.€Previously, 

investments in qualified affordable housing projects 

were accounted for as equity method investments, 
which reflected the operating losses of the affordable 

housing project partnerships in the income statement 
as investment and other income and the tax benefits 
as a reduction to income tax expense. In addition, 

under the new proportional amortization method, the 
value of the commitments to fund qualified affordable 

housing projects is included in other assets on the 
balance sheet and a liability is recorded for the 
unfunded portion.€In 2014, we restated the prior 

period financial statements to reflect the impact of the 
retrospective application of the new accounting 
guidance. The table below presents the impact of the new accounting guidance on our previously reported earnings per share 
applicable to the common shareholders. Earnings per share applicable to the common shareholders of TheBank of New York Mellon Corporation As previously reported As revised (in dollars) YTD13 YTD12 YTD13 YTD12 Basic $ 1.75

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Other-than-temporary impairment 
We routinely conduct periodic reviews of all 
securities using economic models to identify and 
evaluate each investment security to determine 
whether OTTI has occurred. Various inputs to the 

economic models are used to determine if an 
unrealized loss on securities is other-than-temporary.  

For example, the most significant inputs related to 
non-agency RMBS are: Ł Default rate - the number of mortgage loans expected to go into default over the life of the 
transaction, which is driven by the roll rate of 
loans in each performance bucket that will 
ultimately migrate to default; and Ł Severity - the loss expected to be realized when a 
loan defaults. To determine if an unrealized loss is other

temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the 

underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 
calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 
upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 
in order to determine the projected collateral loss. In 

determining estimated default rate and severity 
assumptions, we review the performance of the 
underlying securities, industry studies, market 
forecasts, as well as our view of the economic 
outlook affecting collateral.  We also evaluate the 

current credit enhancement underlying the bond to 
determine the impact on cash flows. If we determine 

that a given security will be subject to a write-down 
or loss, we record the expected credit loss as a charge 

to earnings. The table below shows the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities for the 2007, 
2006 and late 2005 non-agency RMBS and the 
securities previously held in the Grantor Trust that we 

established in connection with the restructuring of our 
investment securities portfolio in 2009, at Dec. 31,

Pledged assets At Dec. 31, 2014, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of 
$99 billion, including $74 billion pledged as 

collateral for potential borrowings at the Federal 
Reserve Discount Window.  The components of the 

assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2014 included $90 billion 

of securities, $6 billion of loans, $2 billion of trading 

assets and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with 

banks. If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally 

allows banks to freely move assets in and out of their 
pledged assets account to sell or repledge the assets 
for other purposes.€BNY Mellon regularly moves

In the ordinary course of business, we and our 
banking subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing 
interest rates and terms to our directors and executive 
officers and to entities in which certain of our 

directors have an ownership interest or direct or 
indirect subsidiaries of such entities. The aggregate 

amount of these loans was $3 million at Dec. 31, 

2014, $3 million at Dec. 31, 2013 and $5 million at  

Dec. 31, 2012.  These loans are primarily extensions 

of credit under revolving lines of credit established 
for such entities. Our loan portfolio consists of three portfolio segments: commercial, lease financings and 
mortgages. We manage our portfolio at the class 

level which consists of six classes of financing 
receivables: commercial, commercial real estate, 
financial institutions, lease financings, wealth 
management loans and mortgages and other 
residential mortgages. The following tables are

experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor to the creditor, or a modification of the term of the

Other residential mortgages 
The modifications of the other residential mortgage loans in 2014 and 2013 consisted of reducing the 
stated interest rates and in certain cases, a forbearance 
of default and extending the maturity dates. The 

modified loans are primarily collateral dependent for 
which the value is based on the fair value of the 
collateral. TDRs that subsequently defaulted 
There were 24 residential mortgage loans that had been restructured in a TDR during the previous 12 

months and have subsequently defaulted in 2014. The total recorded investment of these loans was $5 

million. 
Credit quality indicators 
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade names to support cross-selling opportunities and 
avoid single name/industry concentrations. Each 

customer is assigned an internal credit rating which is 
mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, 
if possible, based upon a number of dimensions 
which are continually evaluated and may change over 
time.  174 BNY Mellon

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment grade and non-investment grade 
categories based on rating criteria largely consistent 

with those of the public rating agencies. Each 

customer in the portfolio is assigned an internal credit 
rating. These internal credit ratings are generally 

consistent with the ratings categories of the public 
rating agencies. Customers with ratings consistent 

with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3 (Moody™s) or better are 

considered to be investment grade. Those clients 

with ratings lower than this threshold are considered 
to be non-investment grade. Wealth management loans and mortgages

$ 9,818 
Wealth management non-mortgage loans are not 
typically rated by external rating agencies. A 

majority of the wealth management loans are secured 
by the customers™ investment management accounts 

or custody accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these 

loans are typically investment grade, fixed-income 
securities, equities and/or mutual funds. Internal 

ratings for this portion of the wealth management 
portfolio, therefore, would equate to investment grade 
external ratings. Wealth management loans are 

provided to select customers based on the pledge of 
other types of assets, including business assets, fixed 
assets or a modest amount of commercial real estate. 
For the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit 
quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider this portfolio of loans to be investment 
grade. Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages are not correlated to external ratings. 
Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to 

high-net-worth individuals, which are secured 
primarily by residential property.  These loans are 

primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages with 
a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 60% at 

origination. In the wealth management portfolio, less 

than 1% of the mortgages were past due at Dec. 31, 

2014. At Dec. 31, 2014, the wealth management mortgage portfolio consisted of the following geographic 
concentrations: California - 22%; New York - 20%; 

Massachusetts - 15%; Florida - 8%; and other - 35%. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 
totaled $1,222 million at Dec. 31, 2014 and $1,385 

million at Dec. 31, 2013.  These loans are not 

typically correlated to external ratings. Included in 

this portfolio at Dec. 31, 2014 are $350 million of 

mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 
quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 
mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  

As of Dec. 31, 2014, the purchased loans in this 
portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 
of 76% at origination and 18% of the serviced loan 

balance was at least 60 days delinquent. The 

properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage 

loans were located (in order of concentration) in 
California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New 

York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland.

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients and totaled $5,882 million at Dec. 

31, 2014 and $3,715 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  

Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in the custody and 
securities clearance business and are generally repaid 
within two business days. 
Other loans 
Other loans primarily includes loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual 
funds and fixed income securities. Margin loans 

We had $20,034 million of secured margin loans on 
our balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2014 compared with 

$15,652 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  Margin loans are 

collateralized with marketable securities and 
borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral 
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan.  

We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans 

and do not allocate any of our allowance for credit 
losses to margin loans. 
Reverse repurchase agreements 

Reverse repurchase agreements are transactions fully collateralized with high-quality liquid securities. 
These transactions carry minimal credit risk and 
therefore are not allocated an allowance for credit 
losses. Note 6 - Goodwill and intangible assets Impairment testing 
BNY Mellon™s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing 
is performed on an annual basis. The Investment 

Management segment consists of two reporting units. 
The investment Services segment is comprised of 
four reporting units. One reporting unit is included in 

the Other segment. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step compares the estimated fair 

value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill 
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. 
However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit 

were to exceed its estimated fair value, a second step 
would be performed that would compare the implied 
fair value of the reporting unit™s goodwill with the 

carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment 

loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying 
amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. BNY Mellon conducted an annual goodwill 
impairment test on a quantitative basis on all seven 
reporting units in the second quarter of 2014.  The 

estimated fair value of the Company™s seven 

reporting units exceeded the carrying value and no 
goodwill impairment was recognized. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment or more often if events or 
circumstances indicate they may be impaired.  176 BNY Mellon 
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Goodwill Total goodwill decreased in 2014 compared with 
2013 primarily resulting from the impact of foreign exchange translation on non-U.S. dollar denominated 
goodwill. The tables below provide a breakdown of 

goodwill by business.

valued using net asset value per share 
In our Investment Management business, we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 
money market and alternative investment funds for 
institutions and other investors. As part of that 

activity we make seed capital investments in certain 
funds. BNY Mellon also holds private equity 

investments, which consist of investments in private 
equity funds, mezzanine financings, SBICs and direct 
equity investments. Seed capital and private equity 

investments are included in other assets. Consistent 

with our policy to focus on our core activities, we 
continue to reduce our exposure to private equity 
investments that are not compliant with the Volcker 

Rule. The fair value of certain of these investments has been estimated using the NAV per share of BNY 

Mellon™s ownership interest in the funds.  The table 

below presents information about BNY Mellon™s 

investments in seed capital and private equity 
investments that have been valued using NAV.

Qualified affordable housing project investments 
In 2014, BNY Mellon adopted ASU 2014-01, 
ﬁAccounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable 

Housing Projects - a Consensus of the FASB 

Emerging Issues Task Force.ﬂ  This ASU permits 

entities that invest in a qualified affordable housing 

project through a limited liability entity to make an 
accounting policy election to account for investments 
using the proportional amortization method if certain 
conditions are met. Under the proportional 

amortization method, the initial cost of the investment 
is amortized in proportion to the tax credits and other 
tax benefits received and the net investment 
performance is recognized in the income statement as 
a component of income tax expense. In addition, 

under the new proportional amortization method, the 
value of the commitments to fund qualified affordable 

housing projects is included in other assets on the 
balance sheet and a liability is recorded for the 
unfunded portion. See Note 2 for the impact of the 

retrospective application of this new accounting 
guidance. Note 8 - Deposits 
Total time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or 
greater was $46.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, and $51.8 

billion at Dec. 31, 2013.  At Dec. 31, 2014, the 

scheduled maturities of all time deposits are as 
follows: 2015 Œ $47.4 billion; 2016 Œ $2 million; 

2017 Œ $28 million; 2018 Œ $2 million; 2019 Œ $- 

million; and 2020 and thereafter Œ $70 million. 
We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to 

satisfy the company™s CRA requirements.  Our total 

investment in qualified affordable housing projects 

totaled $853 million at Dec. 31, 2014 and $754 

million at Dec. 31, 2013.  Commitments to fund 

future investments in qualified affordable housing 

projects totaled $358 million at Dec. 31, 2014 and 

$220 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  A summary of the 

commitments to fund future investments is as 
follows: 2015Š$154 million; 2016Š$110 million; 

2017Š$82 million; 2018Š$2 million; 2019Š$1 

million and 2020 and thereafterŠ$9 million. 
Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were 
$128 million in 2014, $118 million in 2013 and $108 

million in 2012.  Amortization expense included in 

the provision for income taxes was $96 million in 

2014, $88 million in 2013 and $79 million in 2012.

relate to corporate-level initiatives and were therefore 
recorded in the Other segment. In the fourth quarter 

of 2013, restructuring charges were recorded in the 

businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2013, 

restructuring charges were reported in the Other 

segment. Severance payments are primarily paid 

over the salary continuance period in accordance with 
the separation plan. Streamlining actions 

In 2014, we disclosed streamlining actions which included rationalizing our staff and simplifying and 

automating global processes primarily related to 
actions taken across investment services, technology, 

and operations. The initial restructuring charge 

consisted of $125 million of severance costs.  We 

recorded total restructuring charges of $184 million in 

2014 primarily related to severance. The following

If these tax reserves were unnecessary, $669 million 

would affect the effective tax rate in future periods.  

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if 

applicable, related to income taxes in income tax 
expense. Included in the balance sheet at Dec. 31, 

2014 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $199 

million.  The additional tax expense related to interest 

for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014 was $1 million 

compared with $192 million for the year ended Dec. 

31, 2013.  182 BNY Mellon 
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next 12 
months by an amount up to $38 million as a result of 

adjustments related to tax years that are still subject 
to examination. As previously disclosed, on Nov. 10, 2009, BNY 
Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

challenging the IRS™s disallowance of certain foreign 

tax credits claimed for the 2001 and 2002 tax years. 
Trial was held from April 16 to May 17, 2012.  On 

Feb. 11, 2013, BNY Mellon received an adverse 

decision from the U.S. Tax Court.  On Sept. 23, 2013, 

the U.S. Tax Court amended its prior ruling to allow 

BNY Mellon an interest expense deduction and to 

exclude certain items from taxable income. The net 

impact of the court rulings for all years involved and 
related interest decreased after-tax income in 2013 by 

$593 million. 
Note 13 - Long-term debt The U.S. Tax Court ruling was finalized on Feb. 20, 
2014. On March 5, 2014, BNY Mellon appealed the 

decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  On 

Sept. 25, 2014, the government filed its response to 
our appeal. In addition to requesting that the denial 

of foreign tax credits be upheld, the government also 
requested a reversal of the interest deduction allowed 
by the Tax Court in the amended decision.  If the 

interest deduction is ultimately disallowed, further 
income tax expense of approximately $100 million 

may be required. See Note 22 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination through 2010. Our New York State and 

New York City income tax returns are closed to 

examination through 2010. Our UK income tax

Trust-preferred securities 

Mellon Capital III, a Delaware statutory trust owned by BNY Mellon, issued trust preferred securities in 

2006. At Dec. 31, 2014, the sole assets of Mellon 

Capital III are junior subordinated debentures of BNY 
Mellon with maturities and interest rates that match 
the trust preferred securities. BNY Mellon's 

obligations provide a full and unconditional guarantee 
of payment of distributions and other amounts due on 
the trust preferred securities. The guarantee does not 

guarantee payment of distributions or other amounts 
due when Mellon Capital III does not have funds 
available to make such payments. Mellon Capital IV, a Delaware statutory trust owned 

by BNY Mellon, issued trust preferred securities in 

June 2007. The sole assets of Mellon Cap IV 

originally were junior subordinated debentures and a 
stock purchase contract for preferred stock. Through 

a remarketing in May 2012, the junior subordinated 
debentures issued by BNY Mellon and held by 

Mellon Capital IV were sold to third party investors 

and then exchanged for BNY Mellon's senior notes, 

which were sold in a public offering.  The proceeds of 

the sale of the senior notes were used to fund the 
purchase by Mellon Capital IV of $500 million of 

BNY Mellon™s Series A preferred stock, which was 

issued on June 20, 2012. At Dec. 31, 2014, the Series 

A preferred stock was the sole asset of Mellon Capital 

IV.

Note 14 - Securitizations and variable interest 
entities BNY Mellon™s VIEs generally include certain retail, 
institutional and alternative investment funds offered 

to its retail and institutional customers in which it acts 
as the fund™s investment manager.  BNY Mellon earns 

management fees on these funds as well as 
performance fees in certain funds. It may also 

provide start-up capital in its new funds. These VIEs 

are included in the scope of ASU 2010-10, which 

defers the application of ASU 2009-17 for certain 

investment funds, and are reviewed for consolidation 
based on the guidance in ASC 810, Consolidation. 
BNY Mellon has other VIEs, including securitization 
trusts and CLOs, in which BNY Mellon serves as the 

investment manager.  In addition, we provide trust 

and custody services for a fee to entities sponsored by 
other corporations in which we have no other interest. 
These VIEs are evaluated under the guidance 

included in ASU 2009-17.  BNY Mellon has two 

securitizations and several CLOs, which were 
assessed and consolidated in accordance with ASU 

2009-17. The following tables present the incremental assets 
and liabilities included in BNY Mellon™s consolidated 

financial statements, after applying intercompany 
eliminations, as of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013,

with ASC 810 and ASU 2009-17.  The net assets of 

any consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the 

liabilities of the VIE and to settle any investors™ 

ownership liquidation requests, including any seed 
capital invested in the VIE by BNY Mellon.

(a) The carrying value of the Series C and Series D preferred stock is recorded net of issuance costs. 
Holders of both the Series A and Series C preferred 
stock are entitled to receive dividends on each 
dividend payment date (March€20, June€20, 
September€20 and December€20 of each year), if 
declared by BNY Mellon™s Board of Directors.  

Holders of the Series D preferred stock are entitled to 
receive dividends, if declared by our board of 
directors, on each June 20 and December 20, to but 
excluding June 20, 2023; and on each March 20, June 
20, September 20 and December 20, from and 
including June 20, 2023. BNY Mellon™s ability to 

declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or 
otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any 
of our shares that rank junior to the preferred stock as 
to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of 
any assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up of BNY Mellon will be prohibited, subject to 

certain restrictions, in the event that we do not declare 
and pay in full preferred dividends for the then 
current dividend period of the Series A preferred 

stock or the last preceding dividend period of the 
Series C and Series D preferred stock. All of the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred 
stock are owned by Mellon Capital IV, which will 

pass through any dividend on the Series A preferred 

stock to the holders of its Normal Preferred Capital 
Securities. All of the outstanding shares of the Series 

C and Series D preferred stock are held by the 
depositary of the depositary shares, which will pass 
through the applicable portion of any dividend on the 
Series C and Series D preferred stock to the holders 
of record of their respective depositary shares. On Dec. 22, 2014, The Bank of New York Mellon 

Corporation paid the following dividends for the 
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock for the 
dividend period ending in December 2014 to holders 
of record as of the close of business on Dec. 5, 2014: Ł $1,011.11 per share on the Series A Preferred 
Stock (equivalent to $10.1111 per Normal 

Preferred Capital Security of Mellon Capital IV, 

each representing 1/100th interest in a share of 
Series A Preferred Stock); 
Ł $1,300.00 per share on the Series C Preferred 
Stock (equivalent to $0.3250 per depositary 

share, each representing a 1/4,000th interest in a 
share of the Series C Preferred Stock); and Ł $2,250.00 per share on the Series D Preferred 
Stock (equivalent to $22.50 per depositary share, 

each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of 
the Series D Preferred Stock). The preferred stock is not subject to the operation of a 
sinking fund and is not convertible into, or 
exchangeable for, shares of our common stock or any 

other class or series of our other securities. Subject to 

the restrictions in BNY Mellon™s 2007 replacement 

capital covenant, subsequently amended on May 8 
and Sept. 11, 2012, we may redeem the Series A 

preferred stock, in whole or in part, at our option. We 

may also, at our option, redeem the shares of the 
Series C preferred stock in whole or in part, on or 
after the dividend payment date in September 2017 
and the Series D preferred stock in whole or in part, 
on or after the dividend payment date in June 2023.  186 BNY Mellon 
        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Both the Series C or Series D preferred stock can be redeemed in whole but not in part at any time within 
90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event 
(as defined in the Certificate of Designations of the 
Series C preferred stock and the Certificate of 
Designations of the Series D preferred stock). Terms of the Series A preferred stock, Series C 
preferred stock, and Series D preferred stock are 
more fully described in each of their Certificate of 
Designations, each of which is filed as an Exhibit to 
BNY Mellon™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 

year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Temporary equity 

Temporary equity was $229 million at Dec. 31, 2014 
and $230 million at Dec. 31, 2013.  Temporary equity 

represents amounts recorded for redeemable non-
controlling interests resulting from equity-classified 
share-based payment arrangements that are currently 
redeemable or are expected to become redeemable. 
The current redemption value of such awards is 
classified as temporary equity and is adjusted to its 
redemption value at each balance sheet date. Capital adequacy 
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon 

and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 
established quantitative measurements. For the 

Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding 
company, our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon 

must, among other things, qualify as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ. As of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon 
and our bank subsidiaries were considered ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ on the basis of the Tier 1 and Total 

capital to risk-weighted assets ratios and the leverage 
capital ratio (Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets 

as defined for regulatory purposes). Our consolidated and largest bank subsidiary, The 
Bank of New York Mellon, regulatory capital ratios 

are shown below.

regulatory capital ratios are based on Basel III components 

of capital, as phased-in, and asset risk-weightings using the 
Advanced Approach framework.  At Dec. 31, 2014, the 

leverage capital ratio is based on Basel III components of 
capital and quarterly average total assets, as phased-in. At 

Dec. 31, 2013, the regulatory capital ratios are determined 

under Basel I rules. Includes full capital credit for certain 

capital instruments outstanding at Dec. 31, 2013. A

out of non-qualifying instruments began on Jan. 1, 2014. 
For BNY Mellon to qualify as ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ its Tier 1 

and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital ratios must be at least 

6% and 10%, respectively.  For The Bank of New York 

Mellon, our largest bank subsidiary, to qualify as ﬁwell 

capitalized,ﬂ its Tier 1, Total and leverage capital ratios 

must be at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively.  For The 

Bank of New York Mellon to qualify as ﬁadequately 

capitalized,ﬂ its Tier 1, Total and leverage capital ratios 

must be at least 4%, 8% and 3%, respectively. 
(b) Risk-based capital ratios at Dec. 31, 2014 include the net 
impact of the total consolidated assets of certain 
consolidated investment management funds in risk-weighted 
assets. These assets were not included in Dec. 31, 2013 risk-

based ratios. The leverage capital ratio was not impacted. 
If a financial holding company such as BNY Mellon 

fails to qualify as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ, it may lose its 
status as a financial holding company, which may 

restrict its ability to undertake or continue certain 
activities or make acquisitions that are not generally 
permissible for bank holding companies without 
financial holding company status. If The Bank of 

New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A. fails to 

qualify as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ, it may be subject to 
higher FDIC assessments. If a bank holding company such as BNY Mellon or 
bank such as The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A. fails to qualify as ﬁadequately 
capitalizedﬂ, regulatory sanctions and limitations are 
imposed. BNY Mellon 187

Note 17 - Stock-based compensation Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted 
stock units (ﬁRSUsﬂ) and other stock-based awards to 
employees and directors of BNY Mellon.  At Dec. 31, 

2014, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved 

in April 2014, we may issue 48,342,374 new stock-
based awards. Of this amount, 33,967,536 shares 

(subject to potential increase as provided in the Long-
Term Incentive Plan) may be issued as restricted 

stock or RSUs. Stock-based compensation expense 

related to retirement eligibility vesting totaled $88 

million in 2014, $65 million in 2013 and $64 million 

in 2012. BNY Mellon 189 
   €Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Stock options Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the 
date of grant to officers and employees of BNY 

Mellon. Generally, each option granted is exercisable 

between one and ten years from the date of grant.  No 

stock options were granted in 2014 and 2013. The compensation cost that has been charged against 
income was $28 million for 2014 (including $1 

million recorded in restructuring expense), $49 

million for 2013 and $70 million for 2012.  The total 

income tax benefit recognized in the income 
statement was $11 million for 2014, $20 million for 

2013 and $29 million for 2012. 
We used a lattice-based binomial method to calculate 
the fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of 

each option award is estimated on the date of grant 
using the weighted-average assumptions noted in the 
following table: Assumptions 2014 2013 2012 
Dividend yield N/A N/A 3.0% 
Expected volatility N/A N/A 34 
Risk-free interest rate N/A N/A 1.38 
Expected option lives (in years) N/A N/A 6.9 
For 2012, assumptions were determined as follows: Ł Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities 
from traded options on our stock, historical volatility 
of our stock, and other factors. Ł We use historical data to estimate option exercises 

and employee terminations within the valuation model. Ł The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield 
curve at the time of grant. Ł The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and 
represents the period of time that options granted are 
expected to be outstanding. A summary of the status of our options as of Dec. 31, 2014, and changes during the year, is presented below:

in 2014, $8 million in 2013 and less than $1 million 

in 2012. Restricted stock and RSUs 
Restricted stock and RSUs are granted under our long-term incentive plans at no cost to the recipient. 
These awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 
restrictions have lapsed, including continued 
employment, for a specified period. The recipient of 

a share of restricted stock is entitled to voting rights 
and generally is entitled to dividends on the common 
stock. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a 

share of common stock after the applicable 
restrictions lapse. The recipient generally is entitled 

to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends 
paid on the underlying common stock during the 
period the RSU is outstanding but does not receive 
voting rights. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the 
date of grant. The expense is recognized over the 

vesting period, which is one to four years.  The total 

compensation expense recognized for restricted stock 
and RSUs was $243 million in 2014 (including $13 

million recorded in restructuring expense), $201 

million in 2013 and $185 million in 2012.  The total 

income tax benefit recognized in the income 
statement was $94 million for 2014, $79 million for 

2013 and $76 million for 2012. 
BNY Mellon™s Executive Committee members were 

granted a target award of 719,947 performance units 
(ﬁPSUsﬂ) in 2014 that are earned annually based on an earnout percentage calculated using a metric of net 
income divided by risk-weighted assets under Basel III. The awards earned in each of the three 
performance periods vest at the end of the third performance period. Certain of the awards are 
granted to three FSA code-staff individuals and are 

required to be marked to market due to discretionary claw-back language contained in their grants. The following table summarizes our nonvested PSU, restricted stock and RSU activity for 2014.€

years. The total fair value of restricted stock and RSUs that vested was $229 million in 2014, $117 million in 

2013 and $84 million in 2012. 
Subsidiary Long-Term Incentive plans 

BNY Mellon also has several subsidiary Long-Term 
Incentive Plans which have issued restricted 
subsidiary shares to certain employees. These share 

awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 
restrictions have lapsed, including continued 
employment for a specified period of time. The 

shares are non-voting and non-dividend paying. 
Once the restrictions lapse, which generally occurs in 
three to five years, the shares can only be sold, at the 

option of the employee, to BNY Mellon at a price 

based generally on the fair value of the subsidiary at 
the time of repurchase. In certain instances BNY 

Mellon has an election to call the shares. BNY Mellon 191

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Assumed healthcare cost trend
 -Domestic post-retirement healthcare benefits 
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in determining benefit expense for 2015 is 6.75% 

decreasing to 4.75% in 2022.  This projection is based 

on various economic models that forecast a 
decreasing growth rate of healthcare expenses over 
time. The underlying assumption is that healthcare 

expense growth cannot outpace gross national 
product (ﬁGNPﬂ) growth indefinitely, and over time a 

lower equilibrium growth rate will be achieved. 
Further, the growth rate assumed in 2022 bears a 

reasonable relationship to the discount rate. An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point for each year would increase the 
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by 
$15 million, or 7%, and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by $1 million, or 7%.  Conversely, a 

decrease in this rate of one percentage point for each 
year would decrease the benefit obligation by $13 

million, or 6%, and the sum of the service and interest 

costs by $1 million, or 6%. 
Assumed healthcare cost trend
 -Foreign post-
retirement healthcare benefits 

An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point for each year would increase the 
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by 
less than $1 million and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by less than $1 million.  Conversely, a 

decrease in this rate of one percentage point for each 
year would decrease the benefit obligation by less 
than $1 million and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by less than $1 million.

fund its post-retirement healthcare plans in 2015 of 

$14 million for the domestic plans and less than $1 

million for the foreign plans. 
Investment strategy and asset allocation BNY Mellon is responsible for the administration of 
various employee pension and healthcare post-
retirement benefits plans, both domestically and 
internationally.  The domestic plans are administered 

by BNY Mellon™s Benefits Administration 

Committee, a named fiduciary.  Subject to the 

following, at all relevant times, BNY Mellon™s 

Benefits Investment Committee, another named 
fiduciary to the domestic plans, is responsible for the 
investment of plan assets. The Benefits Investment 

Committee™s responsibilities include the investment 

of all domestic defined benefit plan assets, as well as 
the determination of investment options offered to 

participants in all domestic defined contribution 
plans. The Benefits Investment Committee conducts 

periodic reviews of investment performance, asset 
allocation and investment manager suitability.  In 
 194 BNY Mellon 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) addition, the Benefits Investment Committee has oversight of the Regional Governance Committees 
for the foreign defined benefit plans. Our investment objective for U.S. and foreign plans is to maximize total return while maintaining a broadly 
diversified portfolio for the primary purpose of 
satisfying obligations for future benefit payments. Equities are the main holding of the plans. Alternative investments (including private equities) 
and fixed income securities provide diversification 
and, in certain cases, lower the volatility of returns. 
In general, equity securities and alternative 
investments within any domestic plan™s portfolio can 

be maintained in the range of 30% to 70% of total 

plan assets, fixed-income securities can range from 
20% to 50% of plan assets and cash equivalents can 
be held in amounts ranging from 0% to 5% of plan 

assets. Actual asset allocation within the approved 

ranges varies from time to time based on economic 
conditions (both current and forecast) and the advice 
of professional advisors. Our pension assets were invested as follows at Dec.

In accordance with ASC 715, BNY Mellon has 
established a three-level hierarchy for fair value 
measurements of its pension plan assets based upon 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset 
as of the measurement date. The valuation hierarchy 

is consistent with guidance in ASC 820 which is 

detailed in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The following is a description of the valuation 
methodologies used for assets measured at fair value, 
as well as the general classification of such assets 
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  
Cash and currency 

This category consists primarily of foreign currency balances and is included in Level 1 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  Foreign currency is translated monthly 

based on current exchange rates. Common and preferred stock, exchange traded funds 
and equity funds These investments include equities, exchange traded funds and equity funds and are valued at the closing 
price reported in the active market in which the 
individual securities are traded, if available. Where 

there are no readily available market quotations, we 
determine fair value primarily based on pricing 
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. 
Venture capital investments and partnership interests 

There are no readily available market quotations for these funds. The fair value of the investments is 

based on the pension plan™s ownership percentage of 

the fair value of the underlying funds as provided by 
the fund managers. These funds are typically valued 

on a quarterly basis. The pension plan™s venture 

capital investments and partnership interests are 
valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value 

and classified as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Collective trust funds 
Collective trust funds include commingled and U.S. equity funds that have no readily available market 
quotations. The fair value of the funds are based on 

the securities in the portfolio, which typically are the 
amount that the fund might reasonably expect to 
receive for the securities upon a sale. These funds are 

valued using observable inputs on either a daily or 
monthly basis. Collective trust funds are included as 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Fixed income investments 
Fixed income investments include U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 
government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 
foreign corporate debt funds. U.S. Treasury securities 
BNY Mellon 195 
 €€€Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded and 
included as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  U.S. 

Government agencies, sovereign government 
obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and foreign 
corporate debt funds are valued based on quoted 
prices for comparable securities with similar yields 
and credit ratings. When quoted prices are not 

available for identical or similar bonds, the bonds are 
valued using discounted cash flows that maximize 
observable inputs, such as current yields of similar 
instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks 
that may not be observable, such as credit and 
liquidity risks. U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 

government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 
foreign corporate debt funds are primarily included as 
Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy with a small 
portion of foreign corporate debt funds included as 
Level 3. Funds of funds 
There are no readily available market quotations for these funds. The fair value of the fund is based on 

NAVs of the funds in the portfolio, which reflects the 

value of the underlying securities. The fair value of 

the underlying securities is typically the amount that 
the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon 
selling those hard to value or illiquid securities within 
the portfolios. These funds are valued using 

unobservable inputs on a monthly basis and are 
included as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the fair value of each major category of plan assets as of Dec. 31, 2014 and 

Dec. 31, 2013, by captions and by ASC 820 valuation

(ﬁESOPﬂ) covering certain domestic full-time 
employees with more than one year of service. The 

ESOP works in conjunction with the defined benefit 

pension plan. Employees are entitled to the higher of 

their benefit under the ESOP or such defined benefit 

pension plan at retirement. Benefits payable under 

the defined benefit pension plan are offset by the 
equivalent value of benefits earned under the ESOP. 
At Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, the ESOP owned 6.4 million and 6.6 million shares of our 
common stock, respectively.  The fair value of total 
ESOP assets was $263 million at Dec. 31, 2014 and 

$236 million at Dec. 31, 2013. 
We recorded $198 million in 2014, $192 million in 
2013 and $180 million in 2012 primarily for 

contributions to our defined contribution plans. 
There were no contributions to the ESOP in 2014, 

2013 and 2012. The Benefits Investment Committee appointed Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. to serve as the 
independent fiduciary to (i) make certain fiduciary 
decisions related to the continued prudence of 
offering the common stock of BNY Mellon or its 

affiliates as an investment option under the plans 

other than with respect to plan sponsor decisions, and 
(ii) select and monitor any managed investments 
(active or passive, including mutual funds) of BNY 
Mellon or its affiliates to be offered to participants as 

investment options under the plans. Note 19 - Company financial information 
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend limitations under the Federal Reserve Act, as well as 

national and state banking laws. Under these statutes, 

prior regulatory consent is required for dividends in 
any year that would exceed the bank™s net profits for 
such year combined with retained net profits for the  198 BNY Mellon 
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) prior two years. Additionally, such bank subsidiaries 
may not declare dividends in excess of net profits on 
hand, as defined, after deducting the amount by 
which the principal amount of all loans, on which 
interest is past due for a period of six months or more, 
exceeds the allowance for credit losses. The payment of dividends also is limited by minimum capital requirements imposed on banks. As 

of Dec. 31, 2014, BNY Mellon™s bank subsidiaries 

exceeded these minimum requirements. Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2014, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 
approximately $2.0 billion without the need for a 

regulatory waiver.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2014, non-

bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 
approximately $1.4 billion. 
The bank subsidiaries declared dividends of $809 
million in 2014
, $1.0 billion in 2013 and $679 million 
in 2012.  The Federal Reserve and the OCC have 

issued additional guidelines that require bank holding 
companies and national banks to continually evaluate 
the level of cash dividends in relation to their 
respective operating income, capital needs, asset 
quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy with respect to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding 
companies provides that, as a matter of prudent 
banking, a bank holding company should not 
maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net 
income available to common shareholders has been 
sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the 

prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be 
consistent with the holding company™s capital needs, 

asset quality and overall financial condition. The 

Federal Reserve can also prohibit a dividend if 
payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
banking practice. Any increase in BNY Mellon™s 

ongoing quarterly dividends would require approval 
from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve™s 

current guidance provides that, for large bank holding 

companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 
30% of projected after-tax net income will receive 

particularly close scrutiny. 
The Federal Reserve requires U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 
billion or more, like BNY Mellon, to submit annual 

capital plans for review.€ The Federal Reserve will 

evaluate the bank holding companies™ capital 
adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment 

processes, and their plans to make capital 
distributions, such as dividend payments or stock 
repurchases. BNY Mellon and other affected BHCs may pay 
dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital 
distributions only in accordance with a capital plan 
that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as 
to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The 

Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the 
plan does not show that the covered BHC will meet 
all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a 
CET1 ratio of at least 5% on a 
pro forma 
basis under 
expected and stressed conditions throughout the nine-
quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. 
The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered 
BHC may not make a capital distribution unless after 
giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a CET1 
ratio of at least 5%.  As part of this process, BNY 

Mellon also provides the Federal Reserve with 
estimates of the composition and levels of regulatory 
capital, risk-weighted assets and other measures 
under Basel III under an identified scenario. BNY 

Mellon™s most recent capital plan was submitted to 

the Federal Reserve on Jan. 5, 2015. The Federal 

Reserve has indicated it expects to publish its 
objection or non-objection to the capital plan and 
proposed capital actions, such as dividend payments 
and share repurchases, in March 2015. The Federal Reserve Act limits and requires collateral 
for extensions of credit by our insured subsidiary 
banks to BNY Mellon and certain of its non-bank 

affiliates.  Also, there are restrictions on the amounts 

of investments by such banks in stock and other 
securities of BNY Mellon and such affiliates, and 

restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as 
collateral for loans by such banks. Extensions of 

credit by the banks to each of our affiliates are limited 

to 10% of such bank™s regulatory capital, and in the 

aggregate for BNY Mellon and all such affiliates to 

20%, and collateral must be between 100% and 130% 

of the amount of the credit, depending on the type of 
collateral. Our insured subsidiary banks are required to maintain reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks under 
the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.  Required 

balances averaged $6.3 billion and $5.7 billion for the 

years 2014 and 2013, respectively.

  €€€Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)In the event of impairment of the capital stock of one of the Parent™s national banks or The Bank of New 

York Mellon, the Parent, as the banks™ stockholder, 

could be required to pay such deficiency. 
The Parent guarantees the debt issued by Mellon Funding Corporation, a wholly-owned financing 
subsidiary of the Company.  The Parent also 

guarantees committed and uncommitted lines of 
credit of Pershing LLC and Pershing Limited 
subsidiaries. The Parent guarantees described above 

are full and unconditional and contain the standard 
provisions relating to parent guarantees of subsidiary 
debt. Additionally, the Parent guarantees or 

indemnifies obligations of its consolidated 
subsidiaries as needed. Generally, there are no stated 

notional amounts included in these indemnifications 
and the contingencies triggering the obligation for 
indemnification are not expected to occur.  As a 

result, we are unable to develop an estimate of the 
maximum payout under these indemnifications. 
However, we believe the possibility is remote that we 

will have to make any material payment under these 
guarantees and indemnifications. The Parent™s condensed financial statements are as

to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. BNY Mellon 201 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Note 20 - Fair value measurement Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, 

in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for 

fair value measurements is utilized based upon the 
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or 
liability as of the measurement date. BNY Mellon™s 

own creditworthiness is considered when valuing 
liabilities. Fair value focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or 
distressed sale) between market participants at the 
measurement date under current market conditions. 
If there has been a significant decrease in the volume 
and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change 

in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation 
techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, 

determining the price at which willing market 
participants would transact at the measurement date 
under current market conditions depends on the facts 
and circumstances and requires the use of significant 
judgment. The objective is to determine from 

weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point 
within the range that is most representative of fair 
value under current market conditions. Determination of fair value 
Following is a description of our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value. We have established processes for 

determining fair values. Fair value is based upon 

quoted market prices in active markets, where 
available. For financial instruments where quotes 

from recent exchange transactions are not available, 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash 
flow analysis, comparison to similar instruments, and 
the use of financial models. Discounted cash flow 

analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash 
flows and the level of interest rates. Model-based 

pricing uses inputs of observable prices, where 
available, for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, 
option volatilities and other factors. Models are 

benchmarked and validated by an independent 
internal risk management function. Our valuation 

process takes into consideration factors such as 
counterparty credit quality, liquidity, concentration 

concerns, and observability of model parameters. 
Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that 

financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Most derivative contracts are valued using internally 
developed models which are calibrated to observable 
market data and employ standard market pricing 
theory for their valuations. An initial ﬁrisk-neutralﬂ 

valuation is performed on each position assuming 
time-discounting based on an AA credit curve.  Then, 

to arrive at a fair value that incorporates counter-party 

credit risk, a credit adjustment is made to these results 
by discounting each trade™s expected exposures to the 

counterparty using the counterparty™s credit spreads, 

as implied by the credit default swap market. We also 

adjust expected liabilities to the counterparty using 
BNY Mellon™s own credit spreads, as implied by the 

credit default swap market. Accordingly, the 

valuation of our derivative position is sensitive to the 
current changes in our own credit spreads as well as 
those of our counterparties. In certain cases, recent prices may not be observable for instruments that trade in inactive or less active 
markets. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing 

financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we 
make an adjustment to their value. The determination 

of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of 
external quotes, the time since the latest available 
quote and the price volatility of the instrument. Certain parameters in some financial models are not directly observable and, therefore, are based on 
management™s estimates and judgments.  These 

financial instruments are normally traded less 
actively.  We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate 

the possibility of error and revision in the model 
based estimate value. Examples include products 

where parameters such as correlation and recovery 
rates are unobservable. The methods described above for instruments that trade in inactive or less active markets may produce a 
current fair value calculation that may not be 
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of 
future fair values. We believe our methods of 

determining fair value are appropriate and consistent 
with other market participants. However, the use of 

different methodologies or different assumptions to 

value certain financial instruments could result in a 
different estimate of fair value. 
Valuation hierarchy 

A three-level valuation hierarchy is used for 
disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the 
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or  202 BNY Mellon 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) liability as of the measurement date. The three levels 
are described below. 
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and 

liabilities include debt and equity securities, 
derivative financial instruments actively traded on 
exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities that are 

actively traded in highly liquid over-the-counter 

markets. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for example, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for 
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that 
are not active, and inputs that are observable or can 
be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for 

substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments 
that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded 
securities and derivative instruments whose model 
inputs are observable in the market or can be 
corroborated by market-observable data. Examples 

in this category are agency and non-agency 
mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities 
and over-the-counter derivative contracts. 
Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Examples in this category include 

certain private equity investments, derivative 
contracts that are highly structured or long-dated, and 
interests in certain securitized financial assets. A financial instrument™s categorization within the 
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair 
value, as well as the general classification of such 
instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
Securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of 
the valuation hierarchy.  Securities include both long 

and short positions. Level 1 securities include highly 

liquid government bonds, money market funds, 
foreign covered bonds and exchange-traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate 
fair values using pricing models, quoted prices of 
securities with similar characteristics or discounted 
cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which 

would generally be classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy, include agency and non-agency 

mortgage-backed securities, state and political 
subdivisions, commercial mortgage-backed 
securities, sovereign debt, corporate bonds and 
foreign covered bonds. For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine 

fair value primarily based on pricing sources with 
reasonable levels of price transparency that employ 
financial models or obtain comparison to similar 
instruments to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2. 
Pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific 
security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 
price. In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 
securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 

observed trade price and other information feeds from 
the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 
information is included in the fair value assessment 
for such securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, we 
classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  Securities classified within Level 3 

primarily include securities of state and political 
subdivisions and distressed debt securities. BNY Mellon 203 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)At Dec. 31, 2014, more than 99% of our securities 
were valued by pricing sources with reasonable levels 
of price transparency.  Less than 1% of our securities 

were priced based on economic models and non-
binding dealer quotes, and are included in Level 3 of 
the valuation hierarchy.  
Consolidated collateralized loan obligations 
BNY Mellon values assets in consolidated CLOs 
using observable market prices observed from the 
secondary loan market. The returns to the note 

holders are solely dependent on the assets and 
accordingly equal the value of those assets. Based on 

the structure of the CLOs, the valuation of the assets 
is attributable to the note holders. Changes in the 

values of assets and liabilities are reflected in the 
income statement as investment and other income and 
interest of investment management fund note holders, 
respectively.  Consolidated CLOs are generally 

classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Derivatives 
We classify exchange-traded derivatives valued using 
quoted prices in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Examples include exchange-traded equity and foreign 
exchange options. Since few other classes of 

derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, most 
of our derivative positions are valued using internally 
developed models that use as their basis readily 
observable market parameters, and we classify them 
in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Such 

derivatives include swaps and options, foreign 
exchange spot and forward contracts and credit 
default swaps. Derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable market parameters in markets that lack 
two-way flow are classified in Level 3 of the 
valuation hierarchy.  Examples include long-dated 

interest rate or currency swaps and options, where 
parameters may be unobservable for longer 
maturities; and certain products, where correlation 
risk is unobservable. The fair value of these 

derivatives composes less than 1% of our derivative 

financial instruments. Additional disclosures of 

derivative instruments are provided in Note 23 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments 
Where quoted market prices are not available, we generally base the fair value of loans and unfunded 
lending-related commitments on observable market 
prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit 
derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If 

observable market prices are not available, we base 
the fair value on estimated cash flows adjusted for 
credit risk which are discounted using an interest rate 
appropriate for the maturity of the applicable loans or 
the unfunded lending-related commitments. Unrealized gains and losses, if any, on unfunded 
lending-related commitments carried at fair value are 
classified in other assets and other liabilities, 
respectively.  Loans and unfunded lending-related 

commitments carried at fair value are generally 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Seed capital 
In our Investment Management business, we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 
money market and alternative investment funds for 
institutions and other investors. As part of that 

activity, we make seed capital investments in certain 

funds. Seed capital is included in other assets. When 

applicable, we value seed capital based on the 
published NAV of the fund.  We include funds in 

which ownership interests in the fund are publicly 
traded in an active market and institutional funds in 
which investors trade in and out daily in Level 1 of 
the valuation hierarchy.  We include open-end funds 

where investors are allowed to sell their ownership 
interest back to the fund less frequently than daily 
and where our interest in the fund contains no other 
rights or obligations in Level 2 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  However, we generally include 

investments in funds that allow investors to sell their 
ownership interest back to the fund less frequently 
than monthly in Level 3, unless actual redemption 
prices are observable. For other types of investments in funds, we consider all of the rights and obligations inherent in our 
ownership interest, including the reported NAV as 

well as other factors that affect the fair value of our 

interest in the fund. To the extent the NAV 

measurements reported for the investments are based 
on unobservable inputs or include other rights and 
obligations (e.g., obligation to meet cash calls), we  204 BNY Mellon 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Certain interests in securitizations 

For certain interests in securitizations that are classified in securities available-for-sale, trading 

assets and long-term debt, we use discounted cash 
flow models, which generally include assumptions of 
projected finance charges related to the securitized 

assets, estimated net credit losses, prepayment 
assumptions and estimates of payments to third-party 
investors. When available, we compare our fair value 

estimates and assumptions to market activity and to 
the actual results of the securitized portfolio. Private equity investments 
Our Other segment includes holdings of nonpublic private equity investments through funds managed by 
third-party investment managers. We value private 

equity investments initially based upon the 
transaction price, which we subsequently adjust to 
reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing 
and sale transactions with third parties or through 
ongoing reviews by the investment managers. Private equity investments also include publicly held 
equity investments, generally obtained through the 
initial public offering of privately held equity 

investments. These equity investments are often held 

in a partnership structure. Publicly held investments 

are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less 
adjustments for regulatory or contractual sales 
restrictions or adjustments to reflect the difficulty in 

selling a partnership interest. Discounts for restrictions are quantified by analyzing the length of the restriction period and the volatility 
of the equity security.  Publicly held private equity 

investments are primarily classified in Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the financial instruments carried at fair value at Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 

2013, by caption on the consolidated balance sheet 
and by valuation hierarchy (as described above). We 

have included credit ratings information in certain of 
the tables because the information indicates the 
degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, and 
significant changes in ratings classifications could 
result in increased risk for us. There were no material 

transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2014. BNY Mellon 205

respectively, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral as allowed by ASC 310, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a 

loan, with an offset to the allowance for credit losses. 
(b) Includes other assets received in satisfaction of debt and loans held for sale.  Loans held for sale are carried on the balance sheet at the 

lower of cost or fair value. Level 3 unobservable inputs The following tables present the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)Estimated fair value of financial instruments The carrying amounts of our financial instruments (i.e., monetary assets and liabilities) are determined 
under different accounting methods - see Note 1 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 

following disclosure discusses these instruments on a 
uniform fair value basis. However, active markets do 

not exist for a significant portion of these 
instruments. For financial instruments where quoted 

prices from identical assets and liabilities in active 
markets do not exist, we determine fair value based 
on discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to 
similar instruments. Discounted cash flow analysis is 

dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the 
level of interest rates. Other judgments would result 

in different fair values.  The fair value information 

supplements the basic financial statements and other 
traditional financial data presented throughout this 
report. A summary of the practices used for determining fair 
value and the respective level in the valuation 
hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities not 
recorded at fair value follows. Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks and interest-bearing deposits 

with banks The estimated fair value of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks is 
equal to the book value as these interest-bearing 
deposits are generally considered cash equivalents. 
These instruments are classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy.  The estimated fair value of 

interest-bearing deposits with banks is generally 
determined using discounted cash flows and duration 
of the instrument to maturity.  The primary inputs 

used to value these transactions are interest rates 
based on current LIBOR market rates and time to 
maturity.  Interest-bearing deposits with banks are 

classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements is based 
on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. Federal 

funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements are classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy. 
Securities held-to-maturity Where quoted prices are available in an active market for identical assets and liabilities, we classify the 
securities as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy.  

Securities are defined as both long and short 
positions. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury 

securities. If quoted market prices are not available for identical assets and liabilities, we estimate fair value using 
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with 
similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. 
Examples of such instruments, which would 
generally be classified as Level 2 within the valuation 
hierarchy, include certain agency and non-agency 

mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-
backed securities and state and political subdivision 
securities. For securities where quotes from active 

markets are not available for identical securities, we 
determine fair value primarily based on pricing 
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
that employ financial models or obtain comparison to 
similar instruments to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain active market 
prices for similar types of securities (e.g., vintage, 
position in the securitization structure) and ascertain 
variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy.  
Loans 
For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, adjusting where 
appropriate for prepayment estimates, using interest 
rates currently being offered for loans with similar 

terms and maturities to borrowers. The estimated fair 

value of margin loans and overdrafts is equal to the 

book value due to the short-term nature of these 
assets. The estimated fair value of other types of 

loans, including our term loan program, is determined 
using discounted cash flows. Inputs include current 

LIBOR market rates adjusted for credit spreads. 
These loans are generally classified as Level 2 within 
the valuation hierarchy. 
 214 BNY Mellon 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Other financial assets Other financial assets include cash, the Federal Reserve Bank stock and accrued interest receivable. 
Cash is classified as Level 1 within the valuation 
hierarchy.  The Federal Reserve Bank stock is not 

redeemable or transferable. The estimated fair value 

of the Federal Reserve Bank stock is based on the 
issue price and is classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy.  Accrued interest receivable is 

generally short-term. As a result, book value is 

considered to equal fair value. Accrued interest 

receivable is included as Level 2 within the valuation 
hierarchy. 
Noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits 

Interest-bearing deposits are comprised of money market rate and demand deposits, savings deposits 
and time deposits. Except for time deposits, book 

value is considered to equal fair value for these 
deposits due to their short duration to maturity or 
payable on demand feature. The fair value of 

interest-bearing time deposits is determined using 
discounted cash flow analysis. Inputs primarily 

consist of current LIBOR market rates and time to 
maturity.  For all noninterest-bearing deposits, book 

value is considered to equal fair value as a result of 
the short duration of the deposit. Interest-bearing and 

noninterest-bearing deposits are classified as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy. 
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements is 
based on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. 
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy. 
Payables to customers and broker-dealers 
The estimated fair value of payables to customers and broker-dealers is equal to the book value, due to the 

demand feature of the payables to customers and 
broker-dealers, and are classified as Level 2 within 

the valuation hierarchy. 
Borrowings 

Borrowings primarily consist of overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Investment 
Services businesses, commercial paper and accrued 
interest payable. The estimated fair value of 

overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our 
Investment Services businesses is considered to equal 
book value as a result of the short duration of the 
overdrafts and is included as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy.  Overdrafts are typically repaid 

within two days.  The estimated fair value of our 

commercial paper is based on discount and duration 
of the commercial paper.  Our commercial paper 

matures within 397 days from date of issue and is not 

redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary 
prepayment. Our commercial paper is included in 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Accrued interest 

payable is generally short-term. As a result, book 

value is considered to equal fair value. Accrued 

interest payable is included as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy. 
Long-term debt 
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates for instruments of the same remaining 
maturity or quoted market prices for the same or 
similar issues. Long-term debt is classified as Level 

2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of financial instruments not 
carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet

BNY Mellon values assets in consolidated CLOs 

using observable market prices from the secondary 
loan market. The returns to the note holders are 

solely dependent on the assets and accordingly equal 
the value of those assets. Mark-to-market valuation 

best reflects the limited interest BNY Mellon has in 

the economic performance of the consolidated CLOs. 
Changes in the values of assets and liabilities are 
reflected in the income statement as investment 
income of consolidated investment management 
funds and in the interest of investment management 
fund noteholders, respectively. 
We have elected the fair value option on $21 million 
of loans. The fair value of these loans was $21 

million at Dec. 31, 2014.  There were no loans at fair 

value at Dec. 31, 2013.  The loans were valued using 

observable market inputs to discount expected loan 
cash flows. These loans are included in Level 2 of 

the valuation hierarchy. 
We have elected the fair value option on $240 million 

of long-term debt. The fair value of this long-term 

debt was $347 million at Dec. 31, 2014 and $321 

million at Dec. 31, 2013.  The long-term debt is 

valued using observable market inputs and is 
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
The following table presents the changes in fair value of the long-term debt included in foreign exchange

Note 22 - Commitments and contingent 
liabilities In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are 
outstanding that are not reflected in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are 
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk 
management products, commercial lending 
commitments, letters of credit and securities lending 
indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce 

interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide 
customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity 
needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate 
risks. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit, 

foreign currency and interest rate risk not recognized 
in the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are 

managed and monitored in manners similar to those 
used for on-balance sheet risks. Significant industry 

concentrations related to credit exposure at Dec. 31, 

2014 are disclosed in the financial institutions 
portfolio exposure table and the commercial portfolio 
exposure table below.

Major concentrations in securities lending are primarily to broker-dealers and are generally

The following table presents a summary of our off-

(b) Net of participations totaling $894 million at Dec. 31, 2014 
and $720 million at Dec. 31, 2013. 
(c) Excludes the indemnification for securities for which BNY 
Mellon acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, 
which totaled $64 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 and $60 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2013. Included in lending commitments are facilities that 
provide liquidity for variable rate tax-exempt 
securities wrapped by monoline insurers. The credit 

approval for these facilities is based on an assessment 
of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers 
factors other than the financial strength of the 
monoline insurer. 
The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of 
credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, 
which does not consider the value of any collateral. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount 
does not necessarily represent future cash 
requirements. A summary of lending commitment 

maturities is as follows: $10.4 billion in less than one 

year, $22.7 billion in one to five years and $200 

million over five years. 
Standby letters of credit (ﬁSBLCﬂ) principally support corporate obligations and were collateralized 
with cash and securities of $421 million and $418 

million at Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, 

respectively.  At Dec. 31, 2014, $3.4 billion of the 

SBLCs will expire within one year and $2.4 billion in 

one to five years. We must recognize, at the inception of standby letters 
of credit and foreign and other guarantees, a liability 
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in 
issuing the guarantee. The fair value of the liability, 

which was recorded with a corresponding asset in 
other assets, was estimated as the present value of 
contractual customer fees. The estimated liability for losses related to these commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the 

allowance for lending-related commitments. The 

allowance for lending-related commitments was $89 

million at Dec. 31, 2014 and $134 million at Dec. 31, 

2013. Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings 
criteria. BNY Mellon™s historical experience is that 

SBLCs typically expire without being funded. 
SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely 
for payment/performance risk. The table below 

shows SBLCs by investment grade: Standby letters of credit Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2014 2013 Investment grade 88% 86% Non-investment grade 12% 14% A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term 

instrument used to finance a commercial contract for 
the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer.  

Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent 
upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it  218 BNY Mellon 
         Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying transaction. As a result, the total 

contractual amounts do not necessarily represent 
future cash requirements. Commercial letters of 

credit totaled $255 million at Dec. 31, 2014 compared 

with $310 million at Dec. 31, 2013. 
A securities lending transaction is a fully 
collateralized transaction in which the owner of a 
security agrees to lend the security (typically through 
an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York 

Mellon), to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or 

bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the 
terms of a prearranged contract, which normally 
matures in less than 90 days. 
We typically lend securities with indemnification 
against borrower default. We generally require the 

borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value 
of 102% of the fair value of the securities borrowed, 

which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing 
credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities 

lending transactions. These risks are controlled 

through policies limiting the level of risk that can be 
undertaken. Securities lending transactions are 

generally entered into only with highly-rated 
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications 

were secured by collateral of $316 billion at Dec. 31, 

2014 and $252 billion at Dec. 31, 2013. 
CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon 
and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
(ﬁCIBCﬂ), engages in securities lending activities.€
CIBC Mellon, BNY Mellon, and CIBC jointly and 

severally indemnify securities lenders against specific 
types of borrower default.€At Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 

31, 2013, $64 billion and $60 billion, respectively, of 

borrowings at CIBC Mellon for which BNY Mellon 

acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were 
secured by collateral of $67 billion and $64 billion, 

respectively.  If, upon a default, a borrower™s 

collateral was not sufficient to cover its related 

obligations, certain losses related to the 
indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors. We expect many of these guarantees to expire without 
the need to advance any cash. The revenue 

associated with guarantees frequently depends on the 
credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the 
transaction, including collateral, if any. 
Operating leases Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $328 million in 2014, $335 million in 2013 and $313 

million in 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2014, we were obligated under various noncancelable lease agreements, some of which 
provide for additional rents based upon real estate 
taxes, insurance and maintenance and for various 
renewal options. A summary of the future minimum 

rental commitments under noncancelable operating 
leases, net of related sublease revenue, is as follows: 
2015Š$354 million; 2016Š$346 million; 2017Š 

$313 million; 2018Š$210 million; 2019Š$195 

million and 2020 and thereafterŠ$938 million. 
Exposure for certain administrative errors 

In connection with certain offshore tax-exempt funds 
that we manage, we may be liable to the funds for 
certain administrative errors. The errors relate to the 

resident status of such funds, potentially exposing the 
Company to a tax liability related to the funds™ 
earnings. The Company is in discussions with tax 

authorities regarding the funds. With the charge 

recorded in 2014 for this matter, we believe we are 

appropriately accrued and the additional reasonably 
possible exposure is not significant. Indemnification arrangements 
We have provided standard representations for 
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture 
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and 
other similar types of arrangements and customary 
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings 
related to providing financial services that are not 
otherwise included above. Insurance has been 

purchased to mitigate certain of these risks. 
Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts 

included in these indemnifications and the 
contingencies triggering the obligation for 
indemnification are not expected to occur.  

Furthermore, often counterparties to these 
transactions provide us with comparable 
indemnifications. We are unable to develop an 

estimate of the maximum payout under these 
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to 

the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority 
of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the 
nature of events that would trigger indemnification or 
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We 
BNY Mellon 219 
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)believe, however, that the possibility that we will 
have to make any material payments for these 
indemnifications is remote. At Dec. 31, 2014 and 

Dec. 31, 2013, we have not recorded any material 
liabilities under these arrangements. Clearing and settlement exchanges 
We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or 
member of, several industry clearing or settlement 
exchanges through which foreign exchange, 
securities, derivatives or other transactions settle. 
Certain of these industry clearing and settlement 
exchanges require their members to guarantee their 
obligations and liabilities or to provide financial 
support in the event other members do not honor their 
obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing 

or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) 
would become insolvent is remote. Additionally, 

certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss 
allocation policies that enable the exchange to 
allocate settlement losses to the members of the 
exchange. 

market loss until the loss occurs. In addition, any 


market loss cannot be quantified. At Dec. 31, 2014 

and Dec. 31, 2013, we have not recorded any material 
liabilities under these arrangements. Legal proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and 
its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in 
or made parties to pending and potential legal actions 
and regulatory matters. Claims for significant 

monetary damages are often asserted in many of these 
legal actions, while claims for disgorgement, 

penalties and/or other remedial sanctions may be 
sought in regulatory matters. It is inherently difficult 

to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters 
given their complexity and the particular facts and 
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. 
However, on the basis of our current knowledge and 

understanding, we do not believe that judgments or 
settlements, if any, arising from these matters (either 

individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to 

applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have 
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 

position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they 

could have a material effect on net income in a given 

period. In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes 
in litigation and regulatory matters, particularly 
where (i) the damages sought are substantial or 
indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early 
stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories 
or a large number of parties, as a matter of course 

there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the 
timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and 
regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss, 
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated 

with each such matter.  In accordance with applicable 

accounting guidance, BNY Mellon establishes 

accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when 
those matters proceed to a stage where they present 
loss contingencies that are both probable and 
reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a 

possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts 
accrued. BNY Mellon will continue to monitor such 

matters for developments that could affect the amount 

of the accrual, and will adjust the accrual amount as 
appropriate. If the loss contingency in question is not 

both probable and reasonably estimable, BNY Mellon 

does not establish an accrual and the matter will 
continue to be monitored for any developments that 
would make the loss contingency both probable and 
reasonably estimable. BNY Mellon believes that its 

accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, in 
the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated 
financial position of BNY Mellon, although future 

accruals could have a material effect on net income in 

a given period. For certain of those matters described herein for which a loss contingency may, in the future, be 

reasonably possible (whether in excess of a related 
accrued liability or where there is no accrued 
liability), BNY Mellon is currently unable to estimate 

a range of reasonably possible loss. For those matters 

where BNY Mellon is able to estimate a reasonably 

possible loss, the aggregate range of such reasonably 
possible loss is up to $200 million in excess of the 

accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon: 
Sentinel Matters As previously disclosed, on Jan. 18, 2008, The Bank 

of New York Mellon filed a proof of claim in the 

Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding of Sentinel 

Management Group, Inc. (ﬁSentinelﬂ) pending in 
federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, 
seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned 
 220 BNY Mellon 
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an account maintained by Sentinel at The Bank of New 

York Mellon.  On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy 

trustee filed an adversary complaint against The Bank 

of New York Mellon seeking to disallow The Bank of 

New York Mellon™s claim and seeking damages for 

allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in 
misappropriating customer assets and improperly 
using those assets as collateral for the loan. In a 

decision dated Nov. 3, 2010, the court found for The 

Bank of New York Mellon and against the bankruptcy 

trustee, holding that The Bank of New York Mellon™s 

loan to Sentinel is valid, fully secured and not subject 
to equitable subordination. The bankruptcy trustee 

appealed this decision, and on Aug. 9, 2012, the 

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 

Circuit issued a decision affirming the trial court™s 

judgment. On Sept. 7, 2012, the bankruptcy trustee 

filed a petition for rehearing on the fraudulent transfer 
portion of the opinion and, on Nov. 30, 2012, the 

Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion and vacated its 

judgment. On Aug. 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals 

reversed its own prior decision and the district court™s 

decision with respect to the bankruptcy trustee™s 

fraudulent transfer and equitable subordination claims 
and remanded the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. On Dec. 10, 2014, the district court 

issued a decision in favor of The Bank of New York 

Mellon holding that the transfers from Sentinel 
cannot be avoided and that The Bank of New York 

Mellon™s lien is valid and not subject to equitable 

subordination. On Jan. 8, 2015, the bankruptcy 

trustee filed a notice of appeal. As previously disclosed, in November 2009, the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Commodities 
Futures Trading Commission (ﬁCFTCﬂ) indicated that 

it is considering a recommendation to the CFTC that 
it file a civil enforcement action against The Bank of 

New York Mellon for possible violations of the 

Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations in 

connection with its relationship to Sentinel. The 

Bank of New York Mellon responded in writing to the 

CFTC on Jan. 29, 2010 and provided an explanation 
as to why an enforcement action is unwarranted. Securities Lending Matters As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon or its affiliates 

have been named as defendants in a number of 
lawsuits initiated by participants in BNY Mellon™s 

securities lending program, which is a part of BNY 
Mellon™s Investment Services business.  The lawsuits 

were filed on various dates from 2009 to 2013, and 
are currently pending in courts in North Carolina and 
Illinois. The complaints assert contractual, statutory, 

and common law claims, including claims for 
negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.  The 

plaintiffs allege losses in connection with the 

investment of securities lending collateral in Lehman 
Brothers Holdings, Inc., and seek damages as to those 
losses. Foreign Exchange Matters As previously disclosed, beginning in December 
2009, government authorities have been conducting 
inquiries seeking information relating primarily to 
standing instruction foreign exchange transactions in 
connection with custody services BNY Mellon 

provides to public pension plans and certain other 
custody clients. BNY Mellon is cooperating with 

these inquiries. In addition, on Oct. 4, 2011, the New York Attorney 
General™s Office, the New York City Comptroller and 

various city pension and benefit funds filed a lawsuit 
asserting claims under the Martin Act and state and 

city false claims acts. On Aug. 5, 2013, the court 

dismissed the false claims act claims, and certain 
plaintiffs have since filed a notice of appeal.  Also, on 

Oct. 4, 2011, the United States Department of Justice 

(ﬁDOJﬂ) filed a civil lawsuit seeking civil penalties 
under 12 U.S.C. Section 1833a and injunctive relief 
under 18 U.S.C. Section 1345 based on alleged 
ongoing violations of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1341 and 
1343 (mail and wire fraud). On Jan. 17, 2012, the 

court approved a partial settlement resolving the 
DOJ™s claim for injunctive relief.  In October 2011, 

several public pension funds in the state of California 
purported to intervene in a qui tam lawsuit that was removed to federal district court in California. On 

March 30, 2012, the court dismissed certain of 
plaintiffs™ claims, including all claims under the 

California False Claims Act.  Certain plaintiffs refiled 

their claims and, on May 1, 2014, the court again 
dismissed the California False Claims Act claims, 

along with certain other claims. Plaintiffs sought 

leave to file an amended complaint that would 
reassert some of those claims, but the court denied 
their motion. BNY Mellon has also been named as a defendant in 
several putative class action federal lawsuits filed on 
various dates in 2011, 2012 and 2014.  The 

complaints, which assert claims including breach of 
contract and ERISA and securities laws violations, all 

allege that the prices BNY Mellon charged for 
BNY Mellon 221 
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)standing instruction foreign exchange transactions executed in connection with custody services 
provided by BNY Mellon were improper.  In addition, 

BNY Mellon has been named as a nominal defendant 

in several derivative lawsuits filed in 2011 and 2012 

in state and federal court in New York.  On July 2, 

2013, the court in the consolidated federal derivative 
action dismissed all of plaintiffs™ claims.  On Oct. 1, 

2013, the court in the consolidated state derivative 
action dismissed all of plaintiffs™ claims.  One of the 

plaintiffs appealed and the dismissal was affirmed on 

Dec. 11, 2014.  To the extent the lawsuits are pending 


trial purposes in federal court in New York. 
On Feb. 17, 2015, BNY Mellon announced an 
additional after-tax litigation expense in anticipation 

of, among other things, the anticipated resolution of 
substantially all foreign exchange-related matters. Tax Litigation 
As previously disclosed, on Aug. 17, 2009, BNY 

Mellon received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency 
disallowing tax benefits for the 2001 and 2002 tax 
years in connection with a 2001 transaction that 
involved the payment of UK corporate income taxes 
that were credited against BNY Mellon™s U.S. 

corporate income tax liability.  On Nov. 10, 2009, 

BNY Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

contesting the disallowance of the benefits. 
Following a trial, the Tax Court upheld the IRS™s 

Notice of Deficiency and disallowed BNY Mellon™s 

tax credits and associated transaction costs on Feb. 
11, 2013.€ On Sept. 23, 2013, the Tax Court issued a 

supplemental opinion, partially reducing the tax 
implications to BNY Mellon of its earlier decision.  

The Tax Court entered a decision formally 

implementing its prior rulings on Feb. 20, 2014. 
BNY Mellon appealed the decision to the Second 

Circuit Court of Appeals on March 5, 2014.  See Note 

12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for additional information. Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings 
As previously disclosed, The Bank of New York 

Mellon as trustee is the petitioner in a legal 
proceeding filed in New York State Supreme Court, 

New York County on June 29, 2011, seeking approval 

of a proposed settlement involving Bank of America 

Corporation, and investors in certain Countrywide 
residential mortgage-securitization trusts.  The New 

York and Delaware Attorneys General intervened in 
Nov. 21, 2013.  On Jan. 31, 2014, the court issued its 

decision approving the settlement except to the extent 
that it releases loan modification claims. The court 

approved all the other terms of the settlement. On 

Feb. 21, 2014, The Bank of New York Mellon 

appealed the court™s decision to exempt loan 

modification claims from the settlement approval and 
several objectors to the settlement cross-appealed. 
The Bank of New York Mellon has also been named 

as a defendant in a lawsuit brought in New York State 

court on June 18, 2014, and later re-filed in federal 
court, by a group of institutional investors. This 

lawsuit is one of a number of legal actions brought by 
MBS investors against The Bank of New York 

Mellon alleging that the trustee has expansive duties 
under the governing agreements, including to 
investigate and pursue breach of representation and 
warranty claims against other parties to the MBS 
transactions. Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford 
As previously disclosed, in late December 2005, 
Pershing LLC became a clearing firm for Stanford 
Group Co. (ﬁSGCﬂ), a registered broker dealer that 

was part of a group of entities ultimately controlled 
by R. Allen Stanford.  Stanford International Bank 

(ﬁSIBﬂ), also controlled by Stanford, issued 
certificates of deposit (ﬁCDsﬂ). Some investors 

allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to 
purchase CDs. In 2009, the SEC charged Stanford 

with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection with the 
sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into receivership. 
Alleged purchasers of CDs have three pending 

lawsuits against Pershing in Texas.  In addition, 

alleged purchasers have filed nearly forty FINRA 

arbitration claims against Pershing in Texas, Florida, 

Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, North 

Carolina and Georgia.  The purchasers allege that 

Pershing, as SGC™s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in 

a fraudulent scheme, and assert contractual, statutory 
and common law claims. On Oct. 8, 2014 and Nov. 

3, 2014, Pershing received awards in its favor from 
two FINRA arbitration panels. 
UK Financial Conduct Authority Matter 
As previously disclosed, the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority (the ﬁFCAﬂ) is conducting an investigation 
into compliance by BNY Mellon, London Branch and 

BNY Mellon (International) Limited (the ﬁfirmsﬂ) 

with the FCA™s Client Assets Sourcebook, which sets 

out€the regime in the UK for the protection of client 
interests.€The matter is on-going and BNY Mellon 
this proceeding. The trial in this matter ended on 
continues to engage with the FCA.  222 BNY Mellon 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Brazilian Postalis Litigation BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A. 

(ﬁDTVMﬂ), a subsidiary that provides a number of 
asset services in Brazil, acts as administrator for 
certain investment funds in which the exclusive 
investor is a public pension fund for postal workers 
called Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos 
Correios e Telégrafos (ﬁPostalisﬂ).  On Aug. 22, 2014, 

Postalis sued DTVM in Brazil for losses related to a 
Postalis investment fund for which DTVM serves as 
fund administrator.  Postalis alleges that DTVM 

failed properly to perform alleged duties, including 
alleged duties to conduct due diligence of and exert 
control over the fund manager, 
Atlântica Administração de Recursos (ﬁAtlânticaﬂ), and Atlântica™s investments.  
Sovereign Wealth Funds Inquiry 

In January 2011, the Enforcement Division of the 

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ﬁSEC 
Staffﬂ) informed several financial institutions, 

including BNY Mellon, that it had commenced an 

inquiry into certain of their business practices and 
relationships with sovereign wealth fund clients. In 

the third quarter of 2014, the SEC Staff issued Wells 

notices to certain current and former employees of 
BNY Mellon, informing them that the SEC Staff has 

made a preliminary determination to recommend 
enforcement action against them for alleged 
violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

in connection with the provision of a limited number 
of internships to relatives of sovereign wealth fund 
officials.  BNY Mellon received a similar Wells 

notice in the fourth quarter of 2014. On Jan. 23, 

2015, BNY Mellon received an additional subpoena 

from the SEC expanding the scope of the SEC™s 

inquiry into the provision of internships and 
employment opportunities offered to officials and 

relatives of officials at government-related entities.  

BNY Mellon has fully cooperated with the SEC 

Staff™s investigation. 
Note 23 - Derivative instruments 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk 
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and 
foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our 

trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers and facilitating customer 
trades. Positions managed for our own account are 

immaterial to our foreign exchange and other trading 
revenue and to our overall results of operations. The notional amounts for derivative financial 
instruments express the dollar volume of the 
transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.  

We perform credit reviews and enter into netting 

agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize 
the credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We 

enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to 

foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risk. 
Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty 

to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a 
risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative 
contract. Counterparty default losses, net of 

recoveries, were $4.7 million in 2014 and $2.1 

million in 2013. 
Hedging derivatives 
We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For hedges 

of available-for-sale investment securities, deposits 

and long-term debt, the hedge documentation 
specifies the terms of the hedged items and the 
interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is 
hedging a fixed rate item and is a fair value hedge, 
that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item due to changes in 
benchmark interest rates, and that the strategy is to 
eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed-
rate interest payments to LIBOR. The available-for-sale investment securities hedged 
consist of sovereign debt, U.S. Treasury bonds, 

agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and 
covered bonds that had original maturities of 30 years 

or less at initial purchase. The swaps on all of these 

investment securities are not callable. All of these 

securities are hedged with ﬁpay fixed rate, receive 
variable rateﬂ swaps of similar maturity, repricing and 

fixed rate coupon. At Dec. 31, 2014, $6.9 billion face 

amount of securities were hedged with interest rate 
swaps that had notional values of $7.0 billion. 
The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally have original maturities of five to 30 years.  

We issue both callable and non-callable debt.  The 

non-callable debt is hedged with ﬁreceive fixed rate, 
pay variable rateﬂ swaps with similar maturity, 

repricing and fixed rate coupon. Callable debt is 

hedged with callable swaps where the call dates of 
the swaps exactly match the call dates of the debt. At 

Dec. 31, 2014, $16.1 billion par value of debt was 
BNY Mellon 223 
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional values of $16.1 billion. 
In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 

maturities of nine months or less to hedge our British 
Pound, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee and 

Singapore Dollar foreign exchange exposure with 
respect to foreign currency forecasted revenue and 
expense transactions in entities that have the U.S. 
dollar as their functional currency.  As of Dec. 31, 

2014, the hedged forecasted foreign currency 
transactions and designated forward foreign exchange 
contract hedges were $243 million (notional), with a 

pre-tax loss of $12 million recorded in accumulated 

other comprehensive income. This loss will be 

reclassified to income or expense over the next nine 

months. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 
remaining maturities of nine months or less as hedges 
against our foreign exchange exposure to various 
foreign currencies with respect to certain interest-
bearing assets and their associated forecasted interest 
revenue. These hedges are designated as cash flow 

hedges. These hedges are effected such that their 

maturities and notional values match those of the 
corresponding transaction. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the 

hedged interest bearing assets and designated forward 
foreign exchange contract hedges were $150 million 

(notional), with a pre-tax loss of less than $1 million 

recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 
income. This loss will be reclassified to net interest 

revenue over the next nine months. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange 

contracts have maturities of less than two years.  The 

derivatives employed are designated as hedges of 
changes in value of our foreign investments due to 
exchange rates. Changes in the value of the forward 

foreign exchange contracts offset the changes in value 

of the foreign investments due to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The change in fair market value of 

these forward foreign exchange contracts is deferred 
and reported within accumulated translation 
adjustments in shareholders™ equity, net of tax.  At 

Dec. 31, 2014, forward foreign exchange contracts 
with notional amounts totaling $7.0 billion were 

designated as hedges. In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we also designate non-derivative financial instruments as 
hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. 
Those non-derivative financial instruments 
designated as hedges of our net investments in 
foreign subsidiaries were all long-term liabilities of 
BNY Mellon in various currencies, and, at Dec. 31, 

2014, had a combined U.S. dollar equivalent value of 
$497 million.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives) 
We manage trading risk through a system of position 
limits, a VaR methodology based on Monte Carlo 

simulations, stop loss advisory triggers, and other 
market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and 

reported to senior management by a separate unit on a 
daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR 

methodology is designed to capture the potential 
overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions. The calculation 
assumes a one-day holding period for most instruments, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and 
incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options. The VaR model is one of several statistical models 
used to develop economic capital results, which is 
allocated to lines of business for computing risk-
adjusted performance. As the VaR methodology does not evaluate risk 
attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or 
other occurrences, the risk assessment process 
includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the 
risk factors in the portfolio and management™s 

assessment of market conditions. Additional stress 

scenarios based upon historical market events are also 
performed. Stress tests, by their design, incorporate 

the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of 
observed correlations. The results of these stress tests 

are reviewed weekly with senior management. Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading included the following: Foreign exchange and othertrading revenue (in millions) 2014 2013 2012 Foreign exchange $ 578 $ 608 $

692 Foreign exchange includes income from purchasing and selling foreign currencies and currency forwards, futures and options. Fixed income reflects results 
from futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, structured foreign currency swaps, options, and fixed income securities. Equity/other primarily 

includes revenue from equity securities and equity 
derivatives. Counterparty credit risk and collateral 
We assess credit risk of our counterparties through 
regular examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of 
publicly available credit rating information. This and 

other information is used to develop proprietary 
credit rating metrics used to assess credit quality. 
Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality of each 
counterparty.  Collateral is generally held or pledged 

in the form of cash or highly liquid government 
securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and 

adjusted daily. 
Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 20 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter 
(ﬁOTCﬂ) derivative instruments Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements of The Bank of New York Mellon, our 

largest banking subsidiary and the subsidiary through 

which BNY Mellon enters into the substantial 

majority of all of its OTC derivative contracts and/or 
collateral agreements, contain provisions that may 
require us to take certain actions if The Bank of New 

York Mellon's public debt rating fell to a certain 

level. Early termination provisions, or "close-out" 

agreements, in those contracts could trigger  226 BNY Mellon 
       Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) immediate payment of outstanding contracts that are in net liability positions. Certain collateral 

agreements would require The Bank of New York 

Mellon to immediately post additional collateral to 
cover some or all of The Bank of New York Mellon's 

liabilities to a counterparty.

Note 24 - Lines of businesses We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and services lines for 
our two principal businesses and the Other segment. Business accounting principles 
Our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the 
generally accepted accounting principles used for 
consolidated financial reporting. These measurement 

principles are designed so that reported results of the 
businesses will track their economic performance. Business results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or whenever 

improvements are made in the measurement 
principles. On Sept. 27, 2013, Newton Management Limited, together with Newton Investment Management Limited, an investment boutique of BNY Mellon, sold Newton™s private client business.  
In 2014, we reclassified the results of Newton™s 

private client business from the Investment 
Management business to the Other segment. The 

reclassifications did not impact consolidated results. 
All prior periods have been restated. In addition, prior period consolidated and Other segment results for the years ended Dec. 31, 2013 and 
Dec. 31, 2012 have been restated to reflect the impact 
of the retrospective application of adopting new 
accounting guidance in 2014 related to our 
investments in qualified affordable housing projects 

(ASU 2014-01). See Note 2 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. BNY Mellon 229 
 €€€€€€Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)The primary types of revenue for our two principal businesses and the Other segment are presented below: 
Business Primary types of revenue Investment Management€Investment management and performance fees from:Mutual funds Institutional clients 
Private clients 
High-net-worth individuals and families, endowments and foundations and relatedentities€Distribution and servicing fees Investment Services Asset servicing fees, including institutional trust and custody fees, broker-dealer services, 
global collateral services and securities lending€€€Issuer services fees, including Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts

€€€Clearing services fees, including broker-dealer services, registered investment advisor 
services and prime brokerage services Treasury services fees, including global payment services and working capital solutions
Foreign exchange Other segment€Credit-related activities
€Leasing operationsCorporate treasury activities
Global markets and institutional banking services
Business exits The results of our businesses are presented and analyzed on an internal management reporting basis: Ł Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue generated by each business. Fee and other 

revenue transferred between businesses under 
revenue transfer agreements is included within 
other revenue in each business. Ł Revenues and expenses associated with specific 
client bases are included in those businesses. For 

example, foreign exchange activity associated 
with clients using custody products is allocated to 
Investment Services. Ł Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses 
based on the yields on the assets and liabilities 
generated by each business. We employ a funds 

transfer pricing system that matches funds with 
the specific assets and liabilities of each business 
based on their interest sensitivity and maturity 
characteristics. Ł Incentive expense related to restricted stock and 
certain corporate overhead charges are allocated 

to the businesses. Ł Support and other indirect expenses are allocated 
to businesses based on internally-developed 
methodologies. Ł Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the 
businesses based on average deposits generated 
within each business. Ł Litigation expense is generally recorded in the 
business in which the charge occurs. 
Ł Management of the investment securities 
portfolio is a shared service contained in the Other segment. As a result, gains and losses 

associated with the valuation of the securities 
portfolio are included in the Other segment. Ł Client deposits serve as the primary funding 
source for our investment securities portfolio. 
We typically allocate all interest revenue to the 

businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, 

accretion related to the portion of the investment 
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been 
included in the results of the businesses. Ł M&I expense is a corporate level item and is 
recorded in the Other segment. Ł Restructuring charges recorded in 2014 relate to 

corporate-level initiatives and were therefore 
recorded in the Other segment. In the fourth 

quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

recorded in the businesses. Prior to the fourth 

quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

reported in the Other segment. Ł Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their 
related income or expense are specifically 
assigned to each business. Businesses with a net 

liability position have been allocated assets. Ł Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected 
within individual businesses. Total revenue includes approximately $2.3 billion in 

2014, $2.3 billion in 2013 and $2.3 billion in 2012 of 

international operations domiciled in the UK which 
comprised 15%, 15% and 16% of total revenue, 

respectively.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and 
subsidiaries (ﬁBNY Mellonﬂ) as of December€31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of 

income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 

ended December€31, 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of BNY Mellon™s 

management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 

audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 

evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of BNY Mellon as of December€31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their 

cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December€31, 2014, in conformity with 
U.S.€generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States), BNY Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting as of December€31, 2014, based on criteria 

established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February€27, 2015 expressed an 

unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of BNY Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting.
