Changes in January 2014 to the probable loss model associated with unsecured wholesale credit exposures within our Advanced Approach

the revised methodology to the portfolio at Sept. 30, 2013, would have added approximately 6% to the risk-weighted assets.

In 2013, we continued to reinvent our company to meet the increasingly complex investing needs of our˛ 
clients. We are proud to be the investments company for the world. BNY Mellon is singularly focused on˛ 

the investment lifecycle Œ either servicing ˜nancial assets through our Investment Services business or˛ 

managing them through our 16 boutiques that make up Investment Management and providing investment˛ 

advice through our wealth management offerings. Our clients entrust us with their valuable ˜nancial assets,˛ 

and it is that stewardship responsibility that drives us.˛ 
Secular trends are shaping our strategy for providing solutions to help our clients meet their objectives.˛ 
The investment process is becoming increasingly global. In a low-interest-rate environment, with slow˛ 

economic growth in almost every part of the world, investors are challenged to ˜nd adequate risk-adjusted˛ 

returns. Pension funds are no longer being created to build protection for retiring employees and populations˛ 

in developed countries are aging, putting further strain on individuals™ ability to meet their long-term needs.˛ 

Consequently, individuals are now charged with saving and investing for themselves.˛ 
Investors Œ be they sophisticated global investment managers, hedge funds, endowments and foundations,˛ 
sovereign wealth funds, governments, ˜nancial advisors, families, individuals or the banks and broker-dealers˛ 

that act as intermediaries to the markets Œ all turn to us for our deep investments expertise and integrated˛ 

set of services and advice to solve some of the most complex issues in the investment process. Our broad˛ 

perspective enables us to address some of the world™s more pressing investment challenges, powering global˛ 

investments to help our clients succeed.˛ 
Many people think of or describe BNY Mellon as a ﬁcustody bank.ﬂ It is true that we are the world™s largest˛ 
custodian, with more than $27 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration. We earn recurring fees for˛ 

providing these services. Custody is also the foundation for a growing series of fee-based services we provide˛ 

across multiple asset classes. We are in the business of developing sophisticated solutions that allow our˛ 

clients to better understand their portfolios of assets and how they might perform under various scenarios,˛ 

and allow them to nimbly develop investment strategies should their outlook change.˛ 
What we do differently from other ﬁcustody banksﬂ is that we also provide clearing and settlement services˛ 
for the vast majority of the world™s institutional broker-dealers. In addition, we provide technology through the˛ 

Pershing platform that services broker-dealers and ˜nancial advisors of all sizes who, in turn, offer capabili

ties to their end clients. We are among the world™s largest providers of clearing for institutions and services for˛ 

˜nancial advisors. And, increasingly, these technology platforms are being developed and used globally and far˛ 

beyond traditional clearing and recordkeeping purposes. I say all this because, in Investment Services, we are˛ 

a technology and services company embedded in a well-capitalized, extremely liquid, conservatively managed˛ 

and highly rated bank. And our company is an institution that is integral to the smooth and continuous˛ 

functioning of the world™s ˜nancial markets.˛ 
This brings me to Investment Management. It is a terri˜c business and highly complementary to our other˛ 
businesses. It, too, is fee-based and relies on intellectual rather than ˜nancial capital to grow and thrive. It is˛ 

driven by people who research, study, analyze and develop investment portfolios and strategies that meet the˛ 

needs of our discerning clients. We have become the eighth-largest investment manager in the world through˛ 

our 16 highly successful investment boutiques. Each boutique is run as a separately branded ˜rm with its own˛ 

investment strategies, products and/or fund structures, and independently managed for the bene˜t of the˛ 

investors it serves.˛ 
Investment Management takes advantage of being associated with the world™s largest Investment Services˛ 
˜rm. The technology platforms and services I discussed earlier are utilized extensively by our various˛ 

boutiques. Investment Management is actively collaborating with our Pershing team on developing a separately˛ 

managed account platform in the Asia Paci˜c region where our investment products will be prominently˛ 

offered. It is the ˜rst multicurrency platform of its kind, where other ˜nancial institutions and their advisors˛ 

will have the ability to select investment products from us and other leading asset managers that ˜t their˛ 

clients™ needs.˛ 
Our Wealth Management unit is also collaborating with Pershing, offering banking products and trust services˛ 
to clients of ˜nancial advisors who subscribe to Pershing™s platform. And there are many more such efforts˛ 

across our two major businesses that have real upside potential for our clients and shareholders.˛

             Since our role is so critical, we purposely manage our balance sheet conservatively and take relatively modest 

credit risk. Our clients not only entrust us with their assets, they also tend to leave their excess cash with us, 

particularly during times of stress, as we are viewed as a safe haven. We invest that cash in relatively short-

duration, high-quality assets. We have purposely limited the credit risk in our investment securities and loan 

portfolios, which makes us a very attractive counterparty. In this prolonged low-rate environment, we have also 

reduced the duration risk in our securities portfolio, positioning us to bene˜t when short-term interest rates 

ultimately rise. We have purposely maintained strict investment criteria in our securities portfolio at the 

sacri˜ce of income in the short term, but strongly feel that is the most prudent course for us. 
Our business model is one that is fee income-based and does not rely on growing risk-weighted assets. We 
generate signi˜cant capital that can be reinvested in new services and strategies that can either drive future 

earnings or be returned to our shareholders. We have signi˜cant ˜nancial ˚exibility and are very focused on 

managing capital wisely for the bene˜t of our shareholders. 
BNY Mellon had a successful year in 2013, with solid ˜nancial results that highlight our focus on driving organic 

growth, building our capital base, powering innovation and operational excellence and returning excess capital 

to shareholders. Here are a few highlights: 
SHAREHOLDER RETURN: In 2013, our Total Shareholder Return was 39 percent. That was after a 
32 percent increase in 2012. We outperformed the S&P 500 Financials Index and our peer group. 

Admittedly,  however, we are still lagging in these measures over a three- and ˜ve-year horizon, so we 

must continue to stay focused on driving performance for the future. 
BOOK VALUE: 
As of year-end, our book value per common share was $31.48, up 4 percent versus 2012. 
Book value remains one of the best measures of our progress in increasing the long-term value of our 

company. 
RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY: 
By this measure, we achieved a healthy return of 15.4 percent
1 in 2013, but it was down from 19.3 percent
1 in 2012. The year-over-year decline in returns re˚ects 
additional equity to support the regulatory capital requirements as well as a large tax reserve we took 

related to a legacy Bank of New York tax matter that signi˜cantly impacted current income. One of our 

key goals for 2014 is improving our return on equity. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE: On a core basis, we did well and earned $2.24 per share
1 in 2013, up 10 percent
1 year over year. But that is after adjusting for the tax reserve we took for the legacy Bank of New York tax 

matter I noted above, which had the effect of reducing earnings to $1.74 per share on a GAAP basis.
 Among our most notable accomplishments in 2013, we: 
grew assets under management by 14 percent year over year, with net in˚ows of $100 billion; 
grew assets under custody and/or administration by 5 percent year over year; 
increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 15 percent and repurchased more than $1 billion 

of our common stock, resulting in a payout ratio for 2013 of 83 percent; and 
strengthened our capital position over the year, ending 2013 with an estimated Basel III Tier 1˛ 

common equity ratio under the Advanced Approach of 11.3 percent.
2˛ 
In 2013, we delivered strong growth in our core investment management and investment services fees and 

continued to invest for future growth. 
INVESTMENT SERVICES
 Œ Investment services fees bene˜tted from new business, increased client activity 
and improved equity values. Our assets under custody and/or administration totaled $27.6 trillion at the end 

of 2013, up $1.3 trillion, or 5 percent year over year. Many of the drivers of our Investment Services business 

showed signi˜cant improvement over 2012. 
Let me share some business metrics that help explain our underlying performance. Average long-term 
mutual fund assets (U.S. platform) grew 19 percent and global daily average revenue trades (DARTS) were 

up 18 percent, bene˜ting clearing services. Average Investment Services loans were up 11 percent, a sign 

of how of our Global Collateral Services business is growing. Depositary receipts programs were down, as 

certain programs terminated due to market events such as M&A and corporate restructurings, and we lost

 some business as we strengthened our pricing discipline. In addition, ongoing weakness in the structured 

debt markets continued to impact Corporate Trust. 
Another important trend is that we are having more robust discussions with the largest investment managers 
in the world about offering a broader solution set beyond custody. For example, one of our largest hedge fund 

clients has been working with us in an outsourcing arrangement to provide an integrated set of capabilities 

that leverage our technology platforms to provide middle-of˜ce solutions that connect seamlessly with the 

clients™ front-end, risk management and compliance systems. 
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
 Œ We had another year of excellent results in Investment Management. 
Fees were up strongly year over year and we attracted net in˚ows of $100 billion.  Our distinctive investment 
capabilities, our success in delivering consistently strong investment performance and our quality client 

service were key factors in driving our results.  Additionally, our outcome-oriented solutions were especially 

valuable to our clients in helping them meet their investment needs, and we experienced growth in demand 

for alternative investments, especially in credit-related investment offerings. 
Throughout 2013, we continued to expand our reach to a wide array of clients globally, including an expansion 
of our European distribution capabilities with both wholesale and institutional clients, and we experienced 

especially strong net ˚ows as a result.  In the Asia Paci˜c region, we continued to build out our distribution 

and manufacturing capabilities, including a range of Japanese equity strategies. 
In Wealth Management, we have become the seventh-largest wealth management ˜rm in the U.S., with 
average Wealth Management loans up 18 percent and deposits up 22 percent during 2013. 
˛ˇ
We have a clear set of strategic priorities to accelerate our progress, increase the value we provide to our 

clients, deliver consistent earnings-per-share growth and improve our returns on equity. These priorities 

can be categorized into three major areas: 
investments that generate organic revenue growth; 
investments that improve the operational ef˜ciency, productivity and resiliency of our ˜rm; and 
investments that enhance our ability to meet global regulatory requirements, mitigate systemic 

risks following the ˜nancial crisis and improve our risk management capabilities and oversight. 

We are making targeted investments to enhance our client solutions and create new revenue streams. 
Within Investment Services: 
Our investment in creating an end-to-end solution for our clients™ growing collateral needs has created 
new business opportunities Œ particularly in collateral segregation, optimization and margin lending Œ 

and has started to show up in our revenues. 
The enhancements we introduced this year to our electronic Global Markets trading platforms ˛

have enabled us to be more competitive and attract greater foreign exchange volumes.˛ 
We are investing in our technology platform to differentiate BNY Mellon in the marketplace by uniquely 

integrating brokerage and bank custody capabilities for ˜nancial intermediaries. 
We established a new European Central Securities Depository to position our company to bene˜t from 

the structural changes in the European settlement process scheduled to go into effect in 2016. 
We are enhancing our capabilities to service and support alternative assets on our global platforms. 

Early in 2014, we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining 65 percent interest of HedgeMark 

International, LLC, a provider of hedge fund managed account and risk analytic services. HedgeMark 

assists in the structuring, oversight and risk monitoring of hedge funds, speci˜cally dedicated managed 

accounts. More and more, institutional investors globally are using dedicated managed accounts Œ 

single-investor funds Œ as a way to invest in hedge funds that allow for greater customization, 

transparency, liquidity and control.

˙˙   Within Investment Management: 
We are investing to grow our share of the U.S. retail investment market with our Dreyfus-branded 

products and expand our investment distribution capabilities to the retirement market. 
Last June, we kicked off an ambitious two-year campaign to increase our Wealth Management sales 

force by 50 percent, which is helping us enter attractive new U.S. markets, such as Silicon Valley, and 

expand in large markets, such as Houston and Dallas. 
We are continuing to expand our alternative investment offerings and strategies to meet the growing 

investor demand for alternatives, as institutions and individuals seek to enhance risk-adjusted returns. 
We invested in the growth of a number of our investment boutiques, including the expansion of both the 

breadth of their investment capabilities, such as those of Alcentra, our global credit investment ˜rm, as 

well as their geographic reach, such as facilitating the expansion of Insight into the U.S. and both 

Mellon Capital and Standish into Asia. 
During 2013, we launched our new BNY Mellon brand, centered on powering global investments to help our 

clients succeed. To help strengthen our brand recognition, we are investing in targeted sponsorships closely 

linked to the expansion of key businesses, such as the BNY Mellon Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge 

universities, our presenting sponsorship of the Head of the Charles
® Regatta and our lead sponsorship of the 
largest Andy Warhol exhibition ever held in Asia. During 2013, we were named Of˜cial Investments Company of 

the San Francisco 49ers, which supports our Wealth Management expansion and the planned opening of our 

Silicon Valley Innovation Lab in 2014. These moves will allow us to tap into and associate with an impressive 

talent pool of engineers, innovators and achievers. Our new Invested in the World advertising campaign 

highlights how our expertise and capabilities help the global markets work and our clients succeed. 
All these investments in organic growth require some upfront spending before we realize the related revenue, 
but we are con˜dent they will enhance our ˜nancial results and shareholder value. 



The Operational Excellence Initiatives program we completed helped mitigate increased regulatory and compli

ance costs and fund other strategic investments. It also set the stage for a broader effort that will engage the 

entire company in a continuous improvement process designed to increase ef˜ciencies. This is an opportunity 

to become more ˚exible, innovative, collaborative and client-centric; invest in our growth initiatives; free up 

the resources to help reduce risk in the marketplace; and, very importantly, help us deliver positive operating 

leverage to our shareholders. Key components include: 
taking advantage of the restructuring of our Investment Services businesses under one umbrella to 

strengthen collaboration and reduce costs; 
further automating and reengineering work to increase straight-through processing, thereby creating 

service quality and productivity gains while reducing risk; 
leveraging new cloud-based and other infrastructure technologies that allow us to reduce the cost 

of our infrastructure, dedicate a greater proportion of our technology expenditures to strategic 

efforts and improve our return on technology investment; and 
better aligning pricing with value provided and reducing or eliminating sub-scale and low-margin 

activities. 
We recognize that at the end of the day, you need to see the results in two key metrics Œ positive operating 

leverage and an improving servicing fees-to-expense ratio in Investment Services. All of our business leaders 

have their personal goals and compensation more directly aligned with the performance around these key 

metrics, as appropriate. 
˘˝


We have been at the forefront of creating technology to signi˜cantly reduce the risks associated with secured 

intraday credit provided in the tri-party repurchase market, where we are the industry leader. We have made 

signi˜cant investments in technology enhancements to implement new procedures, controls and reporting Œ 
IV         
      ˙              ˙                an investment that is unique to our company. But, given our role in the clearing and tri-party market, we 
recognize our importance in solving one of the key areas of concern during and after the ˜nancial crisis. 

I am pleased to report that the intraday credit risk associated with the book of business where we operate 

as agent has been reduced by almost 85 percent, well on the way to achieving the goal of  90 percent risk 

reduction by the end of 2014 outlined by the tri-party reform task force sponsored by the Federal Reserve. 

We are setting the standard for the industry in reforming critical elements of the capital markets 

infrastructure, and we recognize the importance of maintaining strong relationships with our regulators. 
We have also invested in strengthening our compliance, risk and control functions, recognizing that our clients 
and the global capital markets rely on us to be resilient, no matter the circumstances. We have reinforced in 

every employee a risk-awareness mindset and responsibility for identifying and controlling risks. These efforts 

have impacted our expenses, but they are worth it: a sound and strong risk culture allows us the ˚exibility 

to adapt to changing regulatory environments, contributes to maintaining positive shareholder value and 

strengthens the trust our clients place in us to protect their assets. 
˘
Capital strength is one of the distinguishing characteristics of our institution. Our businesses generate capital 

at a relatively fast pace, and we do not rely signi˜cantly on growing risk-weighted assets to grow earnings. 

These attributes, combined with our high-quality balance sheet, allow us to perform well in stressed scenarios. 

They also provide us with the ˜nancial ˚exibility to make targeted investments that drive growth and, at the 

same time, return capital to our shareholders. 
We returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during 
2013, re˚ecting our commitment to return capital to shareholders. 
Our key capital ratios remain strong, with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Advanced 
Approach of 11.3 percent at year-end.
2 In February 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had 
been approved to exit parallel run reporting for U.S. regulatory capital purposes. This approval re˚ects the fact 

that we have met speci˜c risk management and measurement criteria when calculating risk-based capital 

requirements. While we await the ˜nal rules governing the new supplementary leverage ratio, we continue 

to generate signi˜cant levels of capital and have many options, if needed, to address this requirement with 

limited impact on our business. 
˘˝ˇ˜˙
Every ˜nancial services company has a responsibility to apply its resources and knowledge to help address the 

needs of our communities. Given the critical contribution BNY Mellon makes to the smooth functioning of the 

˜nancial markets, our corporate social responsibility is extensive Œ helping our communities, maintaining the 

highest standards of integrity, and contributing to global ˜nancial growth, stability and systemic risk reduction. 
During 2013, BNY Mellon was recognized by two leading CSR ratings organizations. Our company was named 
to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, one of the most highly regarded global sustainability indices. We also 

earned the highest score among all participating ˜nancial companies from CDP, an organization that rates 

companies on their approach to disclosure of climate change information. 
Nearly half of our investment boutiques™ assets under management are now covered under the principles of the 
United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which explicitly acknowledge the relevance to the inves

tor of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. BNY Mellon also has in place a supplier relationship 

management program that focuses on integrating human rights, environmental and societal concerns into our 

core strategic supplier management. 
Our company sustained our tradition of investing in our community during 2013, making a combined 
$34 million in company and employee contributions to enhance education, job training and career development 

opportunities for individuals around the globe facing challenges including chronic unemployment, poverty and 

homelessness, and to support disaster relief. BNY Mellon contributed more than 7 million meals to food-

related charities and helped ship 100,000 packed meals to the Philippines for disaster relief. Our employees 

also donated 90,000 volunteer hours to causes in their local communities. 
V                         Our Returning Military Referral program is helping military personnel successfully transition to civilian life by 
assisting them in understanding how their skills can create value in the civilian world and connecting them 

with employment opportunities through BNY Mellon and other companies. 
ˇ˛˝˜˙
We enter 2014 with increased con˜dence in our ability to meet our strategic and ˜nancial goals. I am excited 

about our future and strong strategic position to capitalize on growth opportunities and changing trends in 

both technology and the investment process. 
We are passionate about accelerating our progress and delivering better returns to you. Achieving positive 
operating leverage in this environment while making the investments we need to drive future growth is a 

delicate balancing act, and we are determined to get it right. Developing and sustaining a culture of excellence 

and continuous improvement will help support our pursuit of this goal. I know we are up to the challenge. 
I see around the company a growing sense of con˜dence. My colleagues share an unwavering commitment to 
capitalize on the strengths of our people and business model through collaboration and innovation, and 

by embracing an entrepreneurial spirit. 
We recognize we have a great opportunity ahead of us to enrich the client experience and create greater 
shareholder value. 
We are working to execute with speed and care, and to demonstrate our commitment to helping clients 
succeed and achieving higher levels of performance. 
I wish to thank our 51,100 employees, who are delivering solutions for some of the most complex issues in 
the ˜nancial markets and providing sound investment advice to institutions and individuals around the world. 

I am grateful for their drive, dedication and creativity, and for living our values every day. 
I also wish to thank our Board of Directors for their strategic counsel and for continuing to challenge us to ask 
more of ourselves and our company. Our executive team and I are proud to lead this great company and share 

a steadfast commitment to excellence and driving shareholder value. 
Thank you for your continuing support.

Reserveﬂ) risk-based capital rules that are based on the 1988 Basel Accord, which is often referred to as ﬁBasel I.ﬂ  Similarly, when in this 

Annual Report we refer to BNY Mellon™s ﬁBasel IIIﬂ capital measures (e.g., Basel III Tier 1 common equity), we mean that capital measure as 

calculated under the final revised capital rules (the ﬁFinal Capital Rulesﬂ) released by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013. 
(g)At Dec. 31, 2013, the estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio is based on our interpretation of the Final Capital Rules, on a fully phased-

The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 
Annual Report. Investors should also read the section 

titled ﬁForward-looking Statements.ﬂ How we reported results 

Throughout this Annual Report, certain measures, 
which are noted as ﬁNon-GAAP financial measures,ﬂ 

exclude certain items. BNY Mellon believes that 

these measures are useful to investors because they 
permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons using 
measures that relate to our ability to enhance 
revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where 
such matters are within our control. We also present 

the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent 
(ﬁFTEﬂ) basis. We believe that this presentation 
allows for comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Certain immaterial reclassifications 
have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current period presentation. See ﬁSupplemental information -
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial 
measuresﬂ beginning on page 118 for a reconciliation 
of financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (ﬁGAAPﬂ) to adjusted Non-GAAP financial 
measures. All information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 in this 
Annual Report is reported on a net income basis. On 
Jan. 15, 2010, BNY Mellon sold Mellon United 
National Bank (ﬁMUNBﬂ), our former national bank subsidiary located in Florida. We applied 

discontinued operations accounting to this business. 
As a result, certain information for 2010 and 2009 in 
this Annual Report is reported on a continuing 

operations basis. 
BNY Mellon is the corporate brand of The Bank of 
New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE symbol: BK).  

BNY Mellon is a global investments company 

dedicated to helping its clients manage and service 
their financial assets throughout the investment 
lifecycle. Whether providing financial services for 

institutions, corporations or individual investors, 
BNY Mellon delivers informed investment 

management and investment services in 35 countries 
and more than 100 markets. As of Dec. 31, 2013
, BNY Mellon had $27.6 trillion in assets under 

custody and/or administration, and $1.6 trillion in 
assets under management. BNY Mellon can act as a 
single point of contact for clients looking to create, trade, hold, manage, service, distribute or restructure 
investments. BNY Mellon™s businesses benefit from the global 
growth in financial assets and from the globalization 
of the investment process. Over the long term, our 

goals are focused on deploying capital to accelerate 
the long-term growth of our businesses and achieving 
superior total returns to shareholders by generating 
first quartile earnings per share growth over time 
relative to a group of peer companies.  4 BNY Mellon 
   
  
 
 
 
  (continued) Key components of our strategy include: Łfocusing on organic growth opportunities; 
Łproviding superior client service versus peers; Łdelivering strong investment performance relative to benchmarks; Łgenerating above-median revenue growth relative 
to peer companies; Łincreasing the percentage of revenue and income 
derived from outside the United States; Łmaintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with 
excellent credit quality; Łimproving efficiency and reducing operational 

risk; and Łdisciplined capital deployment. The Basel I Tier 1 capital ratio has been our principal 

capital measure through 2013 with a targeted ratio of 

Basel I Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%.  

Our current target is to maintain our Basel III Tier 1 

common equity ratio more than 100 basis points 
above the regulatory minimum guidelines. We expect 

to establish a target Basel III Supplementary 

Leverage ratio when the ongoing rulemaking and 
commentary process ends and we move closer to 
implementation. 
Acquisition of HedgeMark International, LLC 
On Feb. 24, 2014, BNY Mellon announced that it has 
signed an agreement to acquire the remaining 65% 
interest of HedgeMark International, LLC, a current 
affiliate and a provider of hedge fund managed 

account and risk analytic services. The deal is 

expected to close in the second quarter, subject to 

regulatory approval. BNY Mellon has held a 35% 

ownership stake in HedgeMark since 2011. 
Exit from parallel run period for calculating risk-
weighted assets under the advanced approaches rule 
On Feb. 21, 2014 the Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had been approved to exit parallel run 

reporting for U.S. regulatory capital purposes, and 
will transition from the general risk-based capital 
rules to the Final Capital Rules™Advanced 

Approaches, effective starting in the second quarter 

of 2014, subject to ongoing qualification. We will be 

required to comply with Advanced Approaches 

reporting and public disclosures commencing on June 
30, 2014. This means, among other things, for 
purposes of determining whether we meet minimum 
risk-based capital requirements, starting with the 
second quarter of 2014 our common equity Tier 1 

capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, and total capital ratio 

will be the lower of that calculated under the general 
risk-based capital rules (during 2014 these ratios are 
determined using a Basel III numerator and Basel I 
risk-weightings) and under the Advanced Approaches 

rule. Volcker Rule 

On Dec. 10, 2013, final rules to implement the Volcker Rule were adopted.  BNY Mellon must 

conform its covered activities and investments with 
the final Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015.  The Volcker 

Rule prohibits covered banking organizations, 

including BNY Mellon, from engaging in proprietary 

trading and conditionally allows banking 
organizations to hold or sponsor only certain U.S. and 

foreign private equity and hedge funds. Ownership 

interests in covered funds that banking entities 
organize and offer will be limited to 3% of the total 

outstanding ownership interests of any individual 
fund at any time more than one year after the date of 
its establishment, and with respect to the aggregate 
value of all such ownership interests in covered 
funds, 3% of the banking organization™s Tier 1 

capital. Moreover, beginning in the third quarter of 

2015, a banking entity relying on the final Volcker 

Rule™s exemption for sponsoring covered funds will 

need to deduct from its Tier 1 capital the value of 

related ownership interests, calculated in accordance 
with the final rule. For additional information 

regarding the Volcker Rule, see ﬁSupervision and 

Regulationﬂ. Proposed rulemaking concerning implementation of 
minimum liquidity standards 
On Oct. 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a notice of proposed rulemaking developed jointly with 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 

(ﬁOCCﬂ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (ﬁFDICﬂ) regarding the U.S. 
implementation of the Basel III liquidity coverage 
ratio (the ﬁLCR Noticeﬂ). The LCR Notice would 

establish a quantitative liquidity coverage ratio 
requirement for certain banking organizations, 

including BNY Mellon, designed to ensure that such 

organizations maintain an adequate level of 

unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the 
entity™s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time 
BNY Mellon 5 
 (continued)horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. This 
proposal was open for comment until Jan. 31, 2014. 
For additional information regarding the LCR Notice, 
see ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ. Sale of Newton™s private client business 

On Sept. 27, 2013, Newton Management Limited, together with Newton Investment Management 
Limited, an investment boutique of BNY Mellon, 

sold Newton™s private client business.  At the time of 

the sale, assets under management related to 
Newton™s private client business totaled $5 billion.  

We recorded a pre-tax gain of $27 million and an 

after-tax gain of $5 million related to this transaction. 
New risk-based and leverage regulatory capital rules 

In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules (the ﬁFinal Capital Rulesﬂ) revising the capital 
framework applicable to U.S. bank holding 
companies (ﬁBHCsﬂ) and banks. The Final Capital 

Rules implement Basel III and certain provisions of 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (the ﬁDodd-Frank Actﬂ or ﬁDodd-

Frankﬂ) for U.S. BHCs and banks (including by 
redefining the components of capital and establishing 
higher minimum percentages for applicable capital 
ratios) and substantially revise the agencies™ general 

risk-based capital rules in a manner designed to make 
them more risk sensitive. The Final Capital Rules 

establish a graduated implementation schedule and 
will be principally phased-in by 2019. In general, the 

Final Capital Rules largely adhere to the rules as 

initially proposed in June 2012. Our estimated Basel 

III Tier 1 common equity ratio (Non-GAAP) 

calculated under the Standardized Approach and 

based on our interpretation of the Final Capital Rules, 
on a fully phased-in basis, was 10.6% at Dec. 31, 
2013. For additional information on the Final Capital 

Rules, see ﬁCapitalﬂ and ﬁSupervision and 
Regulationﬂ. Supplementary leverage ratio proposals 

The Final Capital Rules implement, among other things, for Advanced Approaches banking 

organizations, including the Company, a new Basel 

III-based supplementary leverage ratio with a 
minimum of 3%, to become effective Jan. 1, 2018.  In 

addition, the Basel Committee and the U.S. banking 
agencies are each independently considering potential 
changes to the supplementary leverage ratio that, individually or taken together, could make it 

substantially more restrictive. In January 2014, the 

Basel Committee finalized modifications to the Basel 
III supplementary leverage ratio. Those 

modifications would adjust the supplementary 
leverage ratio™s denominator (referred to as the 

ﬁexposure amountﬂ) by making changes to the 
calculation of the exposure amount attributable to 
certain derivatives exposures and certain securities 
financing transactions but would maintain the 
minimum Tier 1 supplementary leverage ratio 

requirement of 3%. These changes to the 

supplementary leverage ratio denominator have not 
yet been adopted in the U.S. Separately, on July 9, 2013, the U.S. banking 
agencies proposed revisions to the supplementary 
leverage ratio under a notice of proposed rulemaking 
that would only apply to the largest U.S. BHCs and 

banks, including BNY Mellon.  The July 9 proposal 

would require BNY Mellon and other bank holding 

companies that are G-SIBs to maintain a 5% 
supplementary Tier 1 leverage ratio (comprised of the 

current minimum requirement of 3% plus a 2% 
buffer) and require bank subsidiaries of those bank 

holding companies (including our largest bank 

subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon), in order 

to qualify as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under the U.S. 
banking agencies™ prompt corrective action 

framework, to maintain a 6% supplementary Tier 1 

leverage ratio. For additional information regarding 

the supplementary leverage ratio proposals, see 
ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ. Sale of SourceNet Solutions 

On May 31, 2013, BNY Mellon sold SourceNet 
Solutions, our accounts payable outsourcing support 
services provider that was part of our Investment 
Services business. The impact of the sale was not 

significant on net income. ConvergEx 

ConvergEx, an entity in which BNY Mellon has a 
minority interest, completed a divestiture of its 
software platform business. As a result of the 

divestiture and other events, we recognized an after-

tax gain of $109 million on our equity investment in 
April 2013. This gain was offset by an after-tax loss 

recorded in December 2013 of $115 million related to 

the write-down of the goodwill in our equity 
investment in ConvergEx.  The net impact of these 
 6 BNY Mellon 
   (continued) events resulted in a net loss of $6 million, or less than $0.01 per diluted common share, in 2013. Capital plan and share repurchase program and 
dividend increase 
In March 2013, BNY Mellon received confirmation 
that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2013 
capital plan submitted in connection with the Federal 
Reserve™s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 

Review (ﬁCCARﬂ). The board of directors 

subsequently approved the repurchase of up to $1.35 
billion worth of common shares through the first 
quarter of 2014, including both open market 
purchases and employee benefit plan repurchases, 
and a 15% increase in BNY Mellon™s quarterly 

common stock dividend. In 2013, we repurchased 35.1 million common shares 
at an average price of $29.24 per common share for a 

total of $1.03 billion.  Through the 2013 capital plan, 

we are authorized to repurchase $385 million worth 
of common shares through the first quarter of 2014. 
Through Feb. 27, 2014, we repurchased 10.6 million 

common shares at an average price of $32.41 per 

common share for a total of $345 million. 
On April 9, 2013, The Bank of New York Mellon 
Corporation announced a 15% increase in the 
quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.13 per 
share to $0.15 per share. We submitted our 2014 capital plan on Jan. 6, 2014.  
The Federal Reserve has indicated it expects to 
publish its objection or non-objection to the capital 
plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend 
payments and share repurchases, on March 26, 2014. 
We anticipate announcing our 2014 capital plan 

shortly thereafter. 
U.S. Tax Court rulings 

As previously disclosed, on Feb. 11, 2013, the U.S. 
Tax Court issued a ruling against BNY Mellon 

upholding the IRS™ disallowance of certain foreign 

tax credits claimed for the 2001 and 2002 tax years. 
As a result of this ruling, BNY Mellon recorded an 

$854 million after-tax charge in the first quarter of 

2013. As previously disclosed, on Sept. 23, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court amended its prior ruling.€ The new ruling 

increased the interest expense that BNY Mellon could 
deduct as a valid business expense and excluded 
certain items from BNY Mellon™s taxable income for 

those years.€The combination of these items for all 

years involved and related interest, increased after-tax 

income in 2013 by $261 million. As a result of these rulings by the U.S. Tax Court, 
BNY Mellon recorded a net after-tax charge of $593 

million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, in 2013. 
The U.S. Tax Court ruling was finalized on Feb. 20, 

2014. 
We reported net income applicable to common 
shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.0 billion, or $1.74 

per diluted common share in 2013.  Excluding the net 

impact of the U.S. Tax Court™s decision related to the 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits, net 
income applicable to common shareholders totaled 
$2.64 billion, or $2.24 per diluted common share, in 
2013 - Non-GAAP.  These results compare with $2.4 

billion, or $2.03 per diluted common share in 2012 

and $2.5 billion, or $2.03 per diluted common share 
in 2011. 
Highlights of 2013 results 

Ł AUC/A totaled $27.6 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013 
compared with $26.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012.  
The increase primarily reflects higher market 
values and net new business. (See the 

ﬁInvestment Services businessﬂ beginning on 
page 24.) 
Ł Assets under management (ﬁAUMﬂ), excluding securities lending assets, totaled a record $1.6 

trillion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $1.4 

trillion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The increase primarily 

resulted from net new business and higher equity 
market values. (See the ﬁInvestment

Ł Investment services fees totaled $6.8 billion in 2013, an increase of 4% compared with $6.6 
billion in 2012.  The increase reflects higher core 

asset servicing fees driven by organic growth and 

higher market values, higher clearing services 
fees and higher Depositary Receipts revenue, 
partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees 

reflecting the continued run-off of high margin 

structured debt securitizations. (See the 

ﬁInvestment Services businessﬂ beginning on

BNY Mellon 7 
      (continued)Ł Investment management and performance fees totaled $3.4 billion in 2013, compared with $3.2 
billion in 2012.  The increase was driven by 

higher equity market values, net new business 
and the full-year impact of the acquisition of the 
remaining 50% interest in Meriten Investment 
Management GmbH (ﬁMeritenﬂ), partially offset 

by the average impact of the stronger U.S. dollar 
and higher money market fee waivers. (See the 

ﬁInvestment Management businessﬂ beginning on 
page 21). 
Ł Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $674 million in 2013, compared with 

$692 million in 2012.  In 2013, foreign exchange 

revenue increased 17% year-over-year, driven by 

higher volumes and volatility.  Other trading 

revenue decreased in 2013 reflecting lower fixed 

income trading revenue. (See ﬁFee and other 

revenueﬂ beginning on page 9). 
Ł Investment income and other revenue totaled $416 million in 2013 compared with $427 million 

in 2012. The decrease primarily resulted from 

lower leasing and seed capital gains and a decline 
in revenue on foreign currency remeasurement, 
primarily offset by higher equity investment 


tax gain on the sale of Newton™s private client 

business in 2013. (See ﬁFee and other revenueﬂ 

beginning on page 9). 
Ł Net interest revenue totaled $3.0 billion in 2013, 
an increase of $36 million compared with 2012, 

as a change in the mix of interest-earning assets, 
lower funding costs and higher average interest-
earning assets driven by higher deposits were 
primarily offset by lower yields.  Net interest 

margin (FTE) was 1.13% in 2013 compared with 

1.21% in 2012. The decrease primarily reflects 

the impact of lower market rates on interest-
earning assets, partially offset by a change in the 

mix of earning assets. (See ﬁNet interest 

revenueﬂ beginning on page 13). 
Ł The provision for credit losses was a credit of $35 
million in 2013 and a credit of $80 million in 

2012. The credit in 2013 was primarily driven by 

a broad improvement in the credit quality of the 
loan portfolio and a reduction in our qualitative 
allowance. (See ﬁAsset quality and allowance for 

credit lossesﬂ beginning on page 49). 
Ł Noninterest expense totaled $11.3 billion in 2013, 
a decrease of $27 million compared with 2012, 

reflecting lower litigation expense, primarily 
offset by higher staff, software and our branding 
initiatives. (See ﬁNoninterest expenseﬂ beginning 
on page 16). 
Ł The provision for income taxes totaled $1.5 
billion (40.9% effective tax rate-GAAP) in 2013 

and included a net charge of $593 million 

resulting from the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions 

related to the disallowance of certain foreign tax 
credits. Excluding the net charge related to the 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits, the 
provision for income taxes totaled $927 million 
(25.0% effective tax rate) on an operating basis-

Non-GAAP.  This compares with an income tax 

provision of $779 million (23.6% effective tax 

rate) in 2012.  (See ﬁIncome taxesﬂ on page 18). 
Ł The net unrealized pre-tax gain on our total investment securities portfolio was $309 million 

at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $2.4 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2012. The decrease primarily reflects an 

increase in long-term interest rates. (See 

ﬁInvestment securitiesﬂ beginning on page 41). 
Ł At Dec. 31, 2013, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 
common equity ratio (Non-GAAP) calculated 
under the Standardized Approach and based on 

our interpretation of and expectations regarding 
the Final Capital Rules, on a fully phased-in 
basis, was 10.6%. (See ﬁCapitalﬂ beginning on

Results for 2012 In 2012 we reported net income applicable to common shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.4 billion, 

or $2.03 per diluted common share. These results 

were primarily driven by: ŁInvestment services fees totaled $6.6 billion in 2012 compared with $6.8 billion in 2011.  

Improved asset servicing revenue, driven by net 
new business and higher market values, as well as 
higher clearing and treasury services revenues, 
was more than offset by the impact of the sale of 

the Shareowner Services business in the fourth 
quarter of 2011, lower Depositary Receipts 

revenue and lower Corporate Trust fees reflecting 

the continued run-off of high margin structured 

debt securitizations. ŁInvestment management and performance fees 
totaled $3.2 billion in 2012 compared with $3.0

   (continued) million in 2011.  In 2012, foreign exchange 
revenue totaled $520 million, a decrease of 32% 
compared with 2011, driven by a sharp decline in 

volatility and a modest decrease in volumes. 
Other trading revenue was $172 million in 2012 
compared with $87 million in 2011.  The increase 

was primarily driven by improved fixed income 
trading revenue. ŁThe provision for credit losses was a credit of $80 
million in 2012 compared with a provision of $1 
million in 2011.  The credit in 2012 was largely 

driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit 
losses related to the residential mortgage loan 
portfolio. ŁNoninterest expense totaled $11.3 billion in 2012 

compared with $11.1 billion in 2011.  The 

increase was driven by higher litigation expense 
and the cost of generating certain tax credits, 
partially offset by the impact of the sale of 

Shareowner Services and the impact of our 
Operational Excellence Initiatives. Results for 2011 
In 2011, we reported net income applicable to 
common shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.5 billion,

 (continued)Fee and other revenue 
Fee and other revenue totaled $11.8 billion in 2013, 
an increase of 3%, compared with $11.4 billion in 

2012. The year-over-year increase was primarily 

driven by higher investment management revenue, 
asset servicing revenue and clearing services revenue, 
partially offset by lower net securities gains, foreign 

exchange and other trading revenue and distribution 
and servicing fees. Investment services fees 
Investment services fees were impacted by the following compared with 2012: 
Ł Asset servicing fees increased 3% primarily 
reflecting organic growth and higher market 
values, partially offset by lower securities lending 

revenue primarily driven by narrower spreads. Ł Clearing services fees increased 6% primarily 
driven by higher mutual fund and asset-based 
fees and clearance revenue reflecting an increase 
in DARTs, partially offset by higher money 

market fee waivers. Ł Issuer services fees increased 4% primarily reflecting higher Depositary Receipts revenue 
driven by corporate actions, partially offset by 

lower money market mutual fund balances and 
the continued run-off of high margin structured 

debt securitizations in Corporate Trust.  We 

continue to estimate that the run-off of high 

margin structured debt securitizations could 

reduce the Company™s total annual revenue by up 

to one-half of 1% if the structured debt markets 
do not recover. 
Ł Treasury services fees increased 1% primarily 
reflecting higher cash management fees. See the ﬁInvestment Services businessﬂ in ﬁReview of 
businessesﬂ for additional details. Investment management and performance fees 
Investment management and performance fees totaled $3.4 billion in 2013, an increase of 7% compared 

with 2012. The increase was primarily driven by 

higher equity market values, net new business and the 
full-year impact of the Meriten acquisition, partially 
offset by higher money market fee waivers and the 

average impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.  

Performance fees were $130 million in 2013 and 

$136 million in 2012. 
Total AUM for the Investment Management business 

was a record $1.6 trillion at Dec. 31, 2013, compared 

with $1.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The increase 

primarily resulted from net new business and higher 
equity market values. Long-term inflows in 2013 

totaled $95 billion and primarily benefited from 
liability-driven investments and other fixed-income 
products, index funds and alternative investments. See the ﬁInvestment Management businessﬂ in ﬁReview of businessesﬂ for additional details

other trading revenue Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased $18 million, or 3%, from $692 million in 

2012. In 2013, foreign exchange revenue totaled 

$608 million, an increase of 17% compared with 

$520 million in 2012.  The increase was driven by 

higher volumes and volatility.  Other trading revenue 

totaled $66 million in 2013, a decrease of 62% 

compared with 2012.  The decrease primarily reflects 

lower fixed income trading revenue due to lower 
derivatives trading revenue and a loss on inventory 
driven by higher interest rates. Foreign exchange 

revenue and fixed income trading revenue is reported 
in the Investment Services business and the Other 
segment. Equity/other trading revenue is primarily 

reported in the Other segment. The foreign exchange trading engaged in by the Company generates revenues, which are influenced 
by the volume of client transactions and the spread 
realized on these transactions. Revenues are 

impacted by market pressures which continue to be 
increasingly competitive. The level of volume and 

spreads is affected by market volatility, the level of 

cross-border assets held in custody for clients, the 
level and nature of underlying cross-border 
investments and other transactions undertaken by  10 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) corporate and institutional clients. These revenues 
also depend on our ability to manage the risk 
associated with the currency transactions we execute. 
A substantial majority of our foreign exchange trades 

are undertaken for our custody clients in transactions 
where BNY Mellon acts as principal, and not as an 

agent or broker.  As a principal, we earn a profit, if 

any, based on our ability to risk manage the aggregate 

foreign currency positions that we buy and sell on a 
daily basis. Generally speaking, custody clients enter 

into foreign exchange transactions in one of three 
ways: negotiated trading with BNY Mellon, BNY 
Mellon™s 
standing instruction program
, or 
transactions with third-party foreign exchange 

providers
. Negotiated trading generally refers to orders entered by the client or the client™s investment 

manager, with all decisions related to the transaction, 

usually on a transaction-specific basis, made by the 
client or its investment manager.  Such transactions 

may be initiated by (i)€contacting one of our sales 
desks to negotiate the rate for specific transactions, 
(ii)€using electronic trading platforms, or (iii)€electing 
other methods such as those pursuant to a 
benchmarking arrangement, in which pricing is 
determined by an objective market rate adjusted by a 
pre-negotiated spread. Our custody clients choose to 

use third-party foreign exchange providers
 other than 
BNY Mellon for a substantial majority of their U.S. 

dollar-equivalent volume foreign exchange 

transactions. The preponderance of the notional 

value of our trading volume with clients is in 
negotiated trading. Our 
standing instruction program
, including a standing instruction program option called the Defined Spread Offering, which the 

Company introduced to clients in the first quarter of 
2012, provides custody clients and their investment 
managers with an end-to-end solution that allows 
them to shift to BNY Mellon the cost, management 

and execution risk, often in small transactions not 
otherwise eligible for a more favorable rate or 
transactions in restricted and difficult to trade 

currencies. We incur substantial costs in supporting 

the global operational infrastructure required to 
administer the standing instruction program; on a per-

transaction basis, the costs associated with the 
standing instruction program exceed the costs 
associated with negotiated trading. In response to 

competitive market pressures and client requests, we 
are continuing to develop standing instruction 
program products and services and making these new 
products and services available to our clients. In the 

first quarter of 2014, we upgraded one of our standard 
standing instruction programs, known as Session Range. 

defined rules and enhanced post-trade reporting. With respect to our historical Session Range program, 
we typically assign a price derived from the daily 
pricing range for marketable-size foreign exchange 
transactions (generally more than $1 million) 
executed between global financial institutions, known 
as the ﬁinterbank range.ﬂ Using the interbank range 

for the given day, we typically price purchases of 

currencies at or near the low end of this range and 
sales of currencies at or near the high end of this 
range. A description of the pricing rules used in the 

upgraded Session Range program is set forth in the 
program™s disclosure documentation, which is 

available to clients and their investment managers. 
The standing instruction program Defined Spread 
Offering prices transactions in each pricing cycle 

(several times a day in the case of developed market 
currencies) by adding a predetermined spread to an 
objective market source for developed and certain 
emerging market currencies or to a reference rate 

computed by BNY Mellon for other emerging market 

currencies. A shift by custody clients from the standing 
instruction program to other trading options 
combined with competitive market pressures on the 
foreign exchange business may negatively impact our 
foreign exchange revenue.€We continue to invest in 

our foreign exchange trading and execution 
capabilities, which is leading towards enhanced 
customer service and higher volumes. For the year 

ended Dec. 31, 2013, our total revenue for all types of 

foreign exchange trading transactions was $608 

million, or approximately 4% of our total revenue and 

approximately 41% of our foreign exchange revenue 
resulted from foreign exchange transactions 
undertaken through our standing instruction program. Distribution and servicing fees 
Distribution and servicing fee revenue earned from mutual funds are primarily based on average assets in 
the funds and the sales of funds that we manage or 
administer and are primarily reported in the 
Investment Management business. These fees, which 

include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of 
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share 
classes, the funds™ market values and money market 

fee waivers. BNY Mellon 11 
 (continued)The $12 million decrease in distribution and servicing fee revenue compared with 2012 primarily reflects 
higher money market fee waivers and the average 
impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.  The impact of 

distribution and servicing fees on income in any one 
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing 

expense paid to other financial intermediaries to 
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of 
mutual funds. Distribution and servicing expense is 

recorded as noninterest expense on the income 
statement. Financing-related fees 

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the Other segment, include capital markets fees, 
loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.

residual gains, transitional services agreements, gains 
and losses on private equity investments, and other 
income and loss. Asset-related gains include loan, 

real estate and other asset dispositions. Expense 

reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture 
relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf 

of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Transitional 

services agreements primarily relate to the Shareowner Services business, which was sold on 
Dec. 31, 2011.  Other income (loss) primarily 

includes foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), 
other investments and various miscellaneous 
revenues. The $11 million decrease in investment 

and other income compared with 2012 primarily 
resulted from lower lease residual and seed capital 
gains and lower revenue on foreign currency 
remeasurement, partially offset by higher equity 

investment revenue, as well as asset-related gains 
related to the sale of Newton™s private client business. 
Net securities gains 
Net securities gains totaled $141 million in 2013 
compared with $162 million in 2012.  The low 

interest rate environment in 2013 created the 
opportunity for us to realize gains as we rebalanced 
and managed the duration risk of the investment 
securities portfolio. 2012 compared with 2011 

Fee and other revenue totaled $11.4 billion in 2012 
compared with $11.5 billion in 2011
. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of the sale of the 
Shareowner Services business. Fee and other revenue was also impacted by the following: Ł Investment services fees decreased 4% compared 
with 2011 reflecting the impact of lower issuer 
services fees driven by lower Depository 
Receipts revenue and lower Corporate Trust fees 

partially offset by an increase in asset servicing 

fees, clearing services fees, and treasury services 
fees. Ł Investment management and performance fees increased 6% primarily reflecting higher market 

values, net new business, higher performance 
fees and the Meriten acquisition. Ł Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased 18%. Foreign exchange revenue 

decreased 32% driven by a sharp decline in 
volatility and a modest decrease in volumes.

higher deposits were primarily offset by lower yields. 
The net interest margin (FTE) was 1.13% in 2013 
compared with 1.21% in 2012.  The decline in the net 

interest margin (FTE) primarily reflects the impact of 

lower market rates on higher interest-earning assets, 
partially offset by a change in the mix of earning 

assets. Average interest-earning assets were $273 billion in 
2013, compared with $250 billion in 2012.  The 

increase primarily reflects higher client deposits and 
uncertainty in the global marketplace. Average total 

securities increased to $108 billion in 2013, up from 

$99 billion in 2012, reflecting our strategy to invest in 

high-quality investment securities. Average loans 

increased to $48 billion in 2013, up from $43 billion 
in 2012, primarily driven by higher non-margin loans.  

Average interest-bearing deposits with the Federal 

Reserve and other central banks increased to $67

reflecting higher client deposits. 2012 compared with 2011 
Net interest revenue totaled $3.0 billion in 2012, a 
decrease of $11 million compared with 2011, as 

higher average assets driven by growth in client 
deposits, increased investment in high quality 
investment securities and higher loan levels, were 
more than offset by narrower spreads, lower

Central Bank deposits and lower yields on the 
reinvestment of securities. The net interest margin 

(FTE) was 1.21% in 2012 compared with 1.36% in 

2011.  The decline was primarily driven by lower

increased client deposits which were invested in 
lower-yielding assets.

(a) Total noninterest expense excluding Shareowner Services was $10,923 million (Non-GAAP) in 2011.  The Shareowner Services business 
was sold on Dec. 31, 2011. 
Total noninterest expense decreased $27 million 

compared with 2012, primarily reflecting lower 
litigation expense, partially offset by higher staff, 

software, business development, net occupancy and consulting expenses. Excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and M&I, litigation and 
restructuring charges, noninterest expense increased 

5% compared with 2012. We continue to invest in our Compliance, Risk and 
other control functions in light of increasing 
regulatory requirements. Accordingly, our expenses 

are continuing to increase in those areas as a result of 
the need to hire additional staff and advisors and to 

enhance our technology platforms. Staff expense 
Given our mix of fee-based businesses, which are staffed with high-quality professionals, staff expense 

comprised 55% of total noninterest expense in both 

2013 and 2012, excluding amortization of intangible 
assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges. 
Staff expense is comprised of: 
Ł compensation expense, which includes: -salary expense, primarily driven by headcount;-the cost of temporary services and overtime; and -severance expense; Ł incentive expense, which includes: -additional compensation earned under a wide range of sales commission and incentive plans designed to reward a combination of 
individual, business unit and corporate 
performance goals; as well as, -stock-based compensation expense; and Ł employee benefit expense, primarily medical benefits, payroll taxes, pension and other 
retirement benefits. Staff expense was $6.0 billion in 2013, an increase of 

4% compared with 2012. The increase in staff 

expense was primarily driven by higher incentive 
expense as a result of higher pre-tax income, higher 
compensation expense reflecting the continued 
investment in our business, and higher employee  16 BNY Mellon 
    (continued) benefits primarily resulting from increased pension expense. Non-staff expense 
Non-staff expense includes certain expenses that vary 
with the levels of business activity and levels of 
expensed business investments, fixed infrastructure 
costs and expenses associated with corporate 
activities related to technology, compliance, legal, 

productivity initiatives and business development. Non-staff expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and M&I, litigation and 
restructuring charges, totaled $4.9 billion in 2013, an 

increase of 5% compared with 2012.  The increase 

primarily reflects higher software, business 
development, net occupancy, consulting and other 

expenses. Increased software was driven by 

enhancements to our technology platforms and 
periodic reimbursable customer technology expenses. 
Reimbursement for these expenses is included in fee 
revenue. The higher business development expense 

resulted from our corporate branding investments and 
other marketing initiatives. The increase in net 

occupancy expense resulted from costs related to our 
global footprint and New York City real estate 

initiative. Any benefits resulting from these 

initiatives will be realized in future periods. The 

higher consulting expense was driven by regulatory/ 
compliance requirements in support of business 
initiatives. The increase in other expense resulted 

from a provision for administrative errors in certain 
off-shore tax-exempt funds and higher regulatory 

costs, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of 

generating certain tax credits. In 2013, we incurred $70 million of M&I, litigation and restructuring charges compared with $559 

million in 2012. The decrease reflects lower 

litigation expense. A majority of the litigation 

expense in 2012 related to the Sigma and Medical 
Capital Corp. settlements. The financial services industry has seen a continuing increase in the level of litigation and enforcement 
activity.  As a result, we anticipate our legal and 

litigation costs to continue at elevated levels. For 

additional information on our legal proceedings, see 
Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. In 2013, we recorded $45 million in restructuring 
charges, reflecting additional severance charges.  For 

additional information on restructuring charges, see 

Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. 2012 compared with 2011 

Noninterest expense was $11.3 billion in 2012, an 
increase of $221 million, or 2%, compared with 
2011.  The increase primarily reflects higher litigation 

expense, higher variable costs, the cost of generating 
certain tax credits in 2012, higher software 
amortization, employee benefits expense and business 
development expense, the impact of the Meriten 
acquisition and the benefit of state tax credits which 
were recorded in 2011.  Partially offsetting these 

increases was the impact of the sale of the 
Shareowner Services business and savings from our

In 2013, we achieved savings of $716 million on a 
run-rate basis in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2013, 

we achieved the following operational excellence 
initiatives: ŁRealized savings from business restructuring, management rationalization and vendor 
management in Investment Services. Ł Realized savings from reengineering activities relating to Investment Boutique restructurings BNY Mellon 17 
  (continued)and Dreyfus back office operations 
consolidations. Ł Realized savings from continued insourcing of third-party contract developers to our Global 
Delivery Centers and staffing efficiencies in the 

Technology organization. 
Ł Realized savings from optimizing internal technology platforms used by employees. Ł Executed an enhanced procurement process to reduce operating expenses. Ł Continued global footprint position migrations. Ł Lowered operating costs as we continued job migrations to the new Eastern European Global 
Delivery Center and our existing Global Delivery 
Centers. Ł Consolidated offices and reduced real estate by 
an additional 250,000 square feet, primarily in the 
New York Metro region. 
Ł Moved the New York-based treasury and trading 
operations from leased space in December 2013 
and January 2014 and consolidated into an owned 
building in downtown Manhattan, which will 
facilitate future savings. BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of 
$1,520 million (40.9% effective tax rate) in 2013 

including a net charge of $593 million resulting from 

the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions related to the 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits. Excluding 

the net charge related to the disallowance of certain 

foreign tax credits, the provision for income taxes 
totaled $927 million (25.0% effective tax rate) on an 

operating basis - Non-GAAP.  This compares with 

$779 million (23.6% effective tax rate) in 2012 and 

$1.0 billion (29.0% effective tax rate) in 2011. 
See ﬁSupplemental information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measuresﬂ 

beginning on page 118 for additional information.  
We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
26% in the first quarter of 2014. 
We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and service lines for 
our two principal businesses and the Other segment. Business accounting principles Our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting, rather than the 
generally accepted accounting principles used for 
consolidated financial reporting. These measurement 

principles are designed so that reported results of the 
businesses will track their economic performance. For information on the accounting principles of our businesses, the primary types of revenue by business 
and how our businesses are presented and analyzed, 
see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Business results are subject to reclassification whenever improvements are made in the 
measurement principles or when organizational 

changes are made. The results of our businesses may be influenced by client activities that vary by quarter.  In the second 

quarter, we typically experience an increase in 

securities lending fees due to an increase in demand 
to borrow securities outside of the United States. In 

the third quarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is 

typically higher due to an increased level of client 
dividend payments paid in the quarter.  Also in the 

third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to 

reduced client activity.  In the fourth quarter, we 

typically incur higher business development and 
marketing expenses. In our Investment Management 

business, performance fees are typically higher in the 
fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter represents the end 

of the measurement period for many of the 
performance fee-eligible relationships. Net securities gains (losses) are recorded in the Other segment. M&I expense is a corporate-level item and 

is recorded in the Other segment. Beginning in the 

fourth quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were 

recorded in the businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter 

of 2013, restructuring charges were reported in the 

Other segment. The results of our businesses in 2013 were driven by the following factors. The Investment Management 

business benefited from higher market values and net 
new business. Results in the Investment Services 

business benefited from increased core asset servicing 
fees driven by organic growth and higher market 

values, mutual fund and asset-based fees and 
clearance revenue reflecting an increase in DARTS, 
 18 BNY Mellon 
  €€€€
€  (continued) higher Depositary Receipts revenue and higher earning assets were primarily offset by the continued 
foreign exchange and other trading revenue, partially impact of the low interest rate environment. 
offset by the continued run-off of high margin 

structured debt securitizations in Corporate Trust. Noninterest expense decreased slightly compared 
with 2012 as a result of lower litigation expense, Net interest revenue increased as a change in the mix partially offset by higher staff, software and business 

of interest-earning assets and higher average interest-development expenses.

Fee revenue in Investment Management, and to a spread evenly throughout the year, would impact fee 
lesser extent in Investment Services, is impacted by revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings per 

the value of market indices. At Dec. 31, 2013, using common share by $0.02 to $0.04. If however, global 

the Standard & Poor™s (ﬁS&Pﬂ) 500 Index as a proxy equity markets do not perform in line with the S&P 

for the global equity markets, we estimate that a 100-500 Index, the impact to fee revenue and earnings per 

point change in the value of the S&P 500 Index 
share could be different.

  (continued)Business description Our Investment Management business is comprised of our affiliated investment management boutiques, 

wealth management business and global distribution 
companies. Our Investment Management business is responsible, through various subsidiaries, for institutional, 
intermediary, retirement and retail investment 

management, distribution and related services across 
North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific.  The 

investment management boutiques offer a broad 

range of equity, fixed income, cash and alternative/ 

overlay products. In addition to the investment 

subsidiaries, this business includes BNY Mellon 

Investment Management EMEA Limited, BNY 

Mellon Investment Management Hong Kong and 
BNY Mellon Investment Management Singapore, 

which are responsible for the investment management 
and distribution of locally registered products, and the 
Dreyfus Corporation and its affiliates, which are 

responsible for U.S. investment management and 
distribution of retail mutual funds, separately 
managed accounts and annuities. We are one of the 

world™s largest asset managers with a top-10 position 

in the U.S., Europe and globally.  
Through BNY Mellon Wealth Management, we offer 
a full array of investment management, wealth and 
estate planning and private banking solutions to help 
clients protect, grow and transfer their wealth. We 

provide these services through an extensive network 
of offices in the U.S. and select locations around the 

world. Clients include high-net-worth individuals 

and families, family offices, charitable gift programs, 

endowments and foundations. BNY Mellon Wealth 

Management is ranked as the nation™s seventh largest 

wealth manager. 
The results of the Investment Management business are driven by the period-end, average level and mix 
of assets managed and the level of activity in client 
accounts. The overall level of AUM for a given 

period is determined by: Ł the beginning level of AUM; 
Ł the net flows of new assets during the period resulting from new business wins and existing client enrichments, reduced by the loss of clients 
and withdrawals; and Ł the impact of market price appreciation or depreciation, the impact of any acquisitions or 
divestitures and foreign exchange rates. The mix of AUM is determined principally by client 

asset allocation decisions among equities, fixed 
income, money market and alternative investments 
and overlay products. Managed equity assets typically generate higher percentage fees than money market and fixed-income 
assets. Also, actively managed assets typically 

generate higher management fess than indexed or 
passively managed assets of the same type. Management fees are typically subject to fee schedules based on the overall level of assets 
managed for a single client or by individual asset 
class and style. This is most prevalent for 

institutional assets where amounts we manage for 
individual clients are typically large.  
A key driver of organic growth in investment 
management and performance fees is the amount of 
net new AUM flows.  Overall market conditions are 

also key drivers, with a significant long-term 
economic driver being growth of global financial 
assets. Performance fees are generally calculated as a percentage of a portfolio™s performance in excess of a 

benchmark index or a peer group™s performance.  
Net interest revenue is determined by loan and deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between 
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on 
loans and deposits. Expenses in this business are 

mainly driven by staffing costs, incentives and 

distribution and servicing expense. Review of financial results 

Investment management and performance fees are dependent on the overall level and mix of AUM and 


hundredth of one percent) charged for managing 

those assets. Assets under management were $1.6 

trillion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $1.4 trillion 

at Dec. 31, 2012, an increase of 14%.  The increase 

primarily resulted from net new business and higher 
equity market values. Net long-term inflows were 

$95 billion in 2013 and benefited from liability-

driven investments and other fixed-income products,  22 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) index funds and alternative investments. Net short-
term inflows were $5 billion in 2013.  
Revenue generated in the Investment Management business included 46% from non-U.S. sources in 
2013 compared with 45% in 2012. 
In 2013, Investment Management had pre-tax income of $994 million compared with $910 million in 2012. 

Excluding amortization of intangible assets, pre-tax 
income increased $40 million in 2013 compared with  

2012. Investment Management results for 2013 

reflect higher equity market values, net new business, 
the impact of the Meriten acquisition and the pre-tax 
gain on the sale of Newton™s private client business, 

partially offset by higher money market fee waivers 

and the average impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. 
Investment management fees in the Investment Management business were $3.3 billion in 2013 

compared with $3.1 billion in 2012.  The increase 

was primarily driven by higher equity market values, 
net new business and the impact of the Meriten 
acquisition, partially offset by higher money market 

fee waivers and the average impact of the stronger 
U.S. dollar. 
Performance fees were $130 million in 2013 
compared with $137 million in 2012.  Performance 

across a range of strategies generated positive returns, 
which were primarily offset with exceptional 

performance fees generated on liability-driven 
investments in 2012. In 2013, 36% of investment management fees in the Investment Management business were generated 
from managed mutual fund fees. These fees are 

based on the daily average net assets of each fund and 
the management fee paid by that fund. Managed 

mutual fund fee revenue increased 6% in 2013 

compared with 2012.  The increase primarily reflects 

higher equity market values and net new business. Distribution and servicing fees were $172 million in 
2013 compared with $187 million in 2012.  The 

decrease primarily reflects higher money market fee 
waivers and the average impact of the stronger U.S. 
dollar. 
Other fee revenue was $142 million in 2013 

compared with $130 million in 2012.  The increase 

resulted from the pre-tax gain on the sale of Newton™s 

private client business. Net interest revenue was $260 million in 2013 
compared with $214 million in 2012.  The increase 

primarily resulted from higher average loans and 
deposits. Average loans increased 18% in 2013 

compared with 2012, while average deposits 

increased 22% in 2013 compared with 2012. 
Noninterest expense excluding amortization of intangible assets was $2.8 billion in 2013 compared 

with $2.6 billion in 2012.  The increase primarily 

reflects higher incentive expense driven by improved 
results, the impact of the Meriten acquisition, 
investments in strategic initiatives and the annual 
employee merit increase. 2012 compared with 2011 

Income before taxes totaled $910 million in 2012 
compared with $703 million in 2011.  Income before 

taxes (excluding intangible amortization) was $1.1 

billion in 2012 compared with $916 million in 2011.  

Fee and other revenue increased $264 million 
compared to 2011, primarily due to higher market 

values, net new business in both the investment 
management boutiques and wealth management 
business, higher seed capital gains and higher 
performance fees. Net interest revenue increased $10 

million compared to 2011 primarily as a result of 

higher average loan and deposit levels, partially offset 

by narrower spreads and lower accretion. Noninterest 

expense (excluding intangible amortization) increased 
$89 million compared to 2011, primarily due to 

higher incentives expense resulting from an increase 
in performance fees, the annual employee merit 
increase, the Meriten acquisition and higher business 
development expenses. BNY Mellon 23

 (continued) Business description Our Investment Services business provides global custody and related services, broker-dealer services, 

global collateral services, corporate trust and 
depositary receipt and clearing services, as well as 
global payment/working capital solutions to global 
financial institutional clients. Our comprehensive suite of financial solutions includes: global custody, global fund services, 

securities lending, investment manager outsourcing, 
performance and risk analytics, alternative 
investment services, securities clearance, collateral 
management, corporate trust, American and global 

depositary receipt programs, cash management 
solutions, payment services, liquidity services and 
other linked revenues, principally foreign exchange, 
global clearing and execution, managed account 
services and global prime brokerage solutions. Our 

clients include corporations, public funds and 
government agencies, foundations and endowments; 
global financial institutions including banks, broker-

dealers, asset managers, insurance companies and 
central banks; financial intermediaries and 
independent registered investment advisors; and 
hedge fund managers. We help our clients service 

their financial assets through a network of offices and 

operations centers in 35 countries across six 
continents. The results of this business are driven by a number of factors, which include: the level of transaction 
activity; the range of services provided, including 
custody, accounting, fund administration, daily 

valuations, performance measurement and risk 
analytics, securities lending, and investment manager 
back-office outsourcing; the number of accounts; and 

the market value of assets under custody and/or 
administration. Market interest rates impact both 

securities lending revenue and the earnings on client 
deposit balances. Business expenses are driven by 

staff, technology investment, equipment and space 

required to support the services provided by the 
business and the cost of execution, clearance and 
custody of securities. We are one of the leading global securities servicing 
providers with $27.6 trillion of AUC/A at Dec. 31, 

2013. We are the largest custodian for U.S. corporate 

and public pension plans and we service 46% of the 
top 50 endowments. We are a leading custodian in 

the UK and service 20% of UK pensions that require a custodian. Globalization tends to drive cross-

border investment and capital flows, which increases 
the opportunity to provide solutions to our clients. 
The changing regulatory environment is also driving 
demand for new products and services among clients. BNY Mellon is a leader in both global securities and 
U.S. Government securities clearance. We settle 

securities transactions in over 100 markets and 

handle most of the transactions cleared through the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 17 of the 21 

primary dealers. W

party repo collateral with approximately $2 trillion 
globally.  We currently service approximately $1.3 

trillion of the $1.6 trillion tri-party repo market in the 
U.S. BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 
services to dealers and cash investors active in the 
tri-party repurchase, or repo, market. We currently 

have approximately 84% of the market share of the 
U.S. tri-party repo market. As agent, we facilitate 

settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) and 
investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and investor 
agree to a tri-party repo trade and send instructions to 
us. We maintain custody of the collateral (the subject 

securities of the repo), monitor the eligibility and 
sufficiency of the collateral, and execute the payment 

and delivery instructions agreed to and provided by 
the principals. BNY Mellon continues to work to significantly 
reduce the risk associated with the secured intraday 

party repo trades. BNY Mellon has implemented 

several important measures in that regard, including 
reducing the amount of time during which we extend 
intraday credit, implementing three-way trade 
confirmations, reducing the amount of credit 
provided in connection with processing collateral 
substitutions, introducing a functionality that enables 
us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades into new trades without 
extending credit, and requiring dealers to prefund 
their repayment obligations in connection with trades 
collateralized by DTC sourced securities. 
Additionally, in 2013, we limited the collateral 

eligible to secure intraday credit to certain more 
liquid asset classes, resulting in a reduction of 
exposures secured by less liquid forms of collateral. 
We anticipate that the combination of these measures 

will have reduced risks substantially in our tri-party 
repo activity in the near term and, together with BNY Mellon 25 
   (continued)technology enhancements currently in development, will achieve the practical elimination (defined as a 
90% reduction) of intraday credit related to tri-party 
repo processing by the end of 2014. These efforts are consistent with the 
recommendations of the Tri-Party Repo 

Infrastructure Reform Task Force (the ﬁTask Forceﬂ) 

that was sponsored by the Payment Risk Committee 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and 

included representatives from a diverse group of 
market participants, including BNY Mellon. 
Since May 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has released monthly reports on the tri-party 

repo market, including information on aggregate 
volumes of collateral used in all tri-party repo 
transactions by asset class, concentrations, and 
margin levels, which are available at http:// 

www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html
. In 2012, we formed Global Collateral Services which serves broker-dealers and institutional investors 

facing expanding collateral management needs as a 
result of current and emerging regulatory and market 

requirements. Global Collateral Services brings 

together BNY Mellon™s global capabilities in 

segregating, optimizing, financing and transforming 
collateral on behalf of clients, including its market 
leading broker-dealer collateral management, 

securities lending, collateral financing, liquidity and 
derivatives services teams. In securities lending, we are one of the largest 
lenders of U.S. Treasury securities and depositary 

receipts and service a lending pool of approximately 
$3 trillion in 30 markets. We serve as depositary for 1,335 sponsored 
American and global depositary receipt programs at 
Dec. 31, 2013, acting in partnership with leading 
companies from 65 countries - an estimated 60% 
global market share. Pershing and its affiliates provide business solutions 
to approximately 1,600 financial organizations 

globally by delivering dependable operational 
support; robust trading services; flexible technology; 
and an expansive array of investment solutions, 
practice management support and service excellence. Role of BNY Mellon, as a trustee, for mortgage-
backed securitizations BNY Mellon acts as trustee and document custodian 
for certain mortgage-backed security (ﬁMBSﬂ) 
securitization trusts. The role of trustee for MBS 

securitizations is limited; our primary role as trustee 
is to calculate and distribute monthly bond payments 
to bondholders. As a document custodian, we hold 

the mortgage, note, and related documents provided 
to us by the loan originator or seller and provide 
periodic reporting to these parties. BNY Mellon, 

either as document custodian or trustee, does not 
receive mortgage underwriting files (the files that 
contain information related to the creditworthiness of 
the borrower). As trustee or custodian, we have no 

responsibility or liability for the quality of the 
portfolio; we are liable only for performance of our 
limited duties as described above and in the trust 
documents. BNY Mellon is indemnified by the 

servicers or directly from trust assets under the 
governing agreements. BNY Mellon may appear as 

the named plaintiff in legal actions brought by 

servicers in foreclosure and other related proceedings 
because the trustee is the nominee owner of the 
mortgage loans within the trusts. Review of financial results 

AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2013 were $27.6 trillion, an 
increase of 5% from $26.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012.  

The increase was primarily driven by higher market 
values and net new business. AUC/A were 

comprised of 36% equity securities and 64% fixed 
income securities at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with  

33% equity securities and 67% fixed income 
securities at Dec. 31, 2012.  
Income before taxes was $2.8 billion in 2013 
compared with $2.2 billion in 2012.  Income before 

taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets, 
was $2.9 billion in 2013 compared with $2.4 billion 

in 2012. The increase compared with 2012 reflects 

higher asset servicing and clearing services fees and 
higher foreign exchange revenue, higher net interest 
revenue and lower litigation expense. Revenue generated in the Investment Services business included 35% from non-U.S. sources in 
2013 compared with 36% in 2012.

4%, in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting the 
compared with $2.4 billion
 in 2012, primarily following factors: reflecting higher average loans and deposits. Ł Asset servicing fees (global custody, broker-
dealer services and global collateral services) 
were $3.8 billion in 2013 compared with $3.7 

billion in 2012.  The increase primarily reflects 

higher core asset servicing fees driven by organic 

growth and higher market values, partially offset 

by lower securities lending revenue primarily 
driven by narrower spreads. Ł Clearing services fees were $1.3 billion in 2013 
compared with $1.2 billion in 2012.  The 

increase was driven by higher mutual fund and 
asset-based fees and clearance revenue reflecting 
an increase in DARTs, partially offset by higher 

money market fee waivers. Ł Issuer services fees (Corporate Trust and 
Depositary Receipts) were $1.1 billion in 2013, 

compared with $1.0 billion in 2012.  The 

increase primarily resulted from higher 
Depositary Receipts revenue driven by corporate 
actions, partially offset by lower money market 

mutual fund balances and the continued run-off 

of high margin structured debt securitizations in 

Corporate Trust. 
Ł Treasury services fees were $544 million in 2013 
compared with $527 million in 2012.  The 

increase primarily reflects higher cash 
management fees. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled 
$687 million in 2013, compared with $641 million in 

2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher 

volumes and volatility. 
Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets, was $7.2 billion in 2013, compared 

with $7.4 billion in 2012.  The decrease primarily 

resulted from lower litigation expense, partially 
offset by higher staff, software and volume-driven 

expenses, as well as higher consulting expense 
driven by regulatory/compliance requirements and 
business initiatives. 2012 compared with 2011 

Income before taxes totaled $2.2 billion in 2012 
compared with $3.0 billion in 2011.  Income before 

taxes, excluding intangible amortization,was $2.4 

billion in 2012 compared with $3.2 billion in 2011.  

Fee and other revenue decreased $288 million 
reflecting lower foreign exchange revenue, 
Depositary Receipts revenue and Corporate Trust 

fees, partially offset by higher asset servicing fees 

driven by net new business, higher market values and 
higher clearing services revenue reflecting higher 
mutual fund fees and cash management balances. 
Net interest revenue decreased $128 million 
compared with 2011, primarily reflecting lower 

accretion and narrower spreads, partially offset by 

higher average customer deposits. Noninterest 

expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, 
increased $367 million compared with 2011.  The 

increase primarily resulted from higher litigation 
expense and higher software amortization expenses, 
partially offset by volume-driven expenses and the 

impact of the Operational Excellence Initiatives. BNY Mellon 27

The Other segment had a pre-tax loss of $114 million 
in 2013 compared with pre-tax income of $98 million 

in 2012. Total fee and other revenue decreased $103 million 
compared with 2012.  The decrease primarily reflects 

lower fixed income trading revenue due to lower 
derivatives trading revenue and a loss on inventory 
driven by higher interest rates, lower leasing and 
securities gains and lower foreign currency 
remeasurement, partially offset by higher equity 

investment revenue driven by a gain on the sale of a 
property. 
Net interest revenue decreased $84 million compared 
with 2012. The decrease primarily reflects increases 

to the internal credit rates to the businesses for 
domestic deposits in 2013. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $36 
million in 2013 primarily driven by a broad 

improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
and a reduction in our qualitative allowance. Noninterest expense (excluding amortization of intangible assets) decreased $17 million in 2013 

compared with 2012.  The decrease primarily reflects 

lower M&I expense and a decrease in the cost of 
generating certain tax credits, partially offset by 

higher restructuring charges, net occupancy expense, 
 28 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) pension expense and higher business development expenses related to our corporate branding 
investment. 2012 compared with 2011 

Income before taxes totaled $98 million in 2012 
compared with a pre-tax loss of $127 million in 2011.  

Total revenue decreased $59 million in 2012 

compared with 2011, primarily reflecting the impact 

of the sale of the Shareowner Services business in 
2011 and lower gains on loans held-for-sale retained 

from a previously divested bank subsidiary, partially 

offset by higher net interest revenue, net securities 

gains and fixed income trading revenue. Noninterest 

expense, excluding amortization of intangible assets, 
decreased $191 million in 2012 compared with 2011.  

The decrease was driven by the impact of the sale of

Our primary international activities consist of securities services and global payment services in our 
investment services business, and asset management 
in our investment management business. Our clients include some of the world™s largest asset 
managers, insurance companies, corporations, 
financial intermediaries, local authorities and pension 
funds. Through our global network of offices, we 

have developed a deep understanding of local 
requirements and cultural needs, and we pride 
ourselves in providing dedicated service through our 
multilingual sales, marketing and client service 
teams. We conduct business through subsidiaries, branches, 
and representative offices in 35 countries.  We have 

operational centers based in Brussels, Cork, Dublin, 
Wexford, Luxembourg, Singapore, Wroclaw, 

throughout the UK including London, Manchester, 

Brentwood, Edinburgh and Poole, and Chennai and 

Pune in India. At Dec. 31, 2013, we had approximately 9,400 
employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa 

(ﬁEMEAﬂ), approximately 11,600 employees in the 

Asia-Pacific region (ﬁAPACﬂ) and approximately 800 

employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil. BNY Mellon Investment Management operates on a 

multi-boutique model, bringing investors the skills of 
our specialist boutique asset managers, which 
together manage investments spanning virtually all 
asset classes. We are one of the largest global asset managers, 
ranking 8th in the marketplace and are the 8th largest 

asset manager in Europe. We are also a market leader 

in the field of liability-driven investments. At Dec. 31, 2013, our international operations managed 42% of BNY Mellon™s AUM compared with 

41% at Dec. 31, 2012. The increase primarily 

resulted from higher market values and net new 
business. In 2013, BNY Mellon CSD SA/NV received 
regulatory approval as a designated securities 
settlement system and issuer central securities 
depository based in Belgium. BNY Mellon CSD SA/ 

NV will help integrate and simplify settlement and 

safekeeping services across Europe for the benefit of 
our customers. In Europe, we maintain a significant presence in the Undertakings for Collective Investment in 
Transferable Securities Directives (ﬁUCITSﬂ) 

servicing field. In Ireland, BNY Mellon is one of the 

largest administrators (by total net assets) for fund 

administration services across domiciled and non-
domiciled funds. We offer a full range of tailored 

solutions for investment companies, financial 
institutions and institutional investors in Germany.  

We settle securities transactions in over 100 markets.  

We are a leader in servicing tri-party repo collateral 

with approximately $2 trillion globally.  
We serve as depositary for 1,335 sponsored American 
and global depositary receipt programs at Dec. 31, 

2013, acting in partnership with leading companies 
from 65 countries - an estimated 60% global market 
share. We have over 50 years of experience providing trade 
and cash services to financial institutions and central 
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a 

broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to 
financial institutions, corporations and central banks 
depending on the state of market development. In 

emerging markets, we lead with global payments and 

issuer services, introducing other products as the BNY Mellon 29 
     (continued)markets mature. For more established markets, our 
focus is on global, not local, investment services. We are also a full-service global provider of foreign 
exchange services, actively trading in over 80 of the 
world™s currencies.  We serve clients from trading 

rooms in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Revenue generated in the Investment Services business includes 35% from non-U.S. sources in 2013 

compared with 36% in 2012. 
Our financial results, as well as our level of AUM and 
AUC/A, are impacted by the translation of financial 
results denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. 
dollar.  We are primarily impacted by activities 

denominated in the British pound and the Euro. If the 

U.S. dollar depreciates against these currencies, the 
translation impact is a higher level of fee revenue, net 
interest revenue, noninterest expense and AUM and 

AUC/A. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, 

the translated levels of fee revenue, net interest 
revenue, noninterest expense and AUM and AUC/A 

will be lower.

in 2013, 2012 and in 2011.  Net income from 

international operations was $1.6 billion in 2013

in 2011. 
In 2013, revenues from EMEA were $3.8 billion, 
compared with $3.7 billion in 2012 and $3.8 billion 

in 2011.  Revenues from EMEA were up 3% for 2013 

compared to 2012.  The increase in 2013 primarily 

reflects higher investment management revenue, 
partially offset by lower asset servicing and Corporate 

Trust revenue.  Investment Services generated 62% 

and Investment Management generated 37% of 

EMEA revenues.  Net income from EMEA was $822 

million in 2013 compared with $761 million in 2012 

and $867 million in 2011.  
Revenues from APAC were $936 million in 2013 

compared with $902 million in 2012 and $842 

million in 2011.  Revenues from APAC were up 4% 

for 2013 compared to 2012.  The increase in 2013 

primarily resulted from higher equity investment 
revenue, partially offset by lower investment 

management revenue. Revenue from APAC in 2013 

was generated by Investment Services 67%, 

Investment Management 23% and the Other segment 

10%. Net income from APAC was $399 million in 

2013 compared with $349 million in 2012 and $325

Greece 
The following tables present our on- and off-balance 
sheet exposure in Ireland, Italy and Spain at Dec. 31, 

2013 and Dec. 31, 2012. We have provided expanded 

disclosure on these countries as they have 
experienced particular market focus on credit quality 
and are countries experiencing economic concerns. 
Where appropriate, we are offsetting the risk 

associated with the gross exposure in these countries 
with collateral that has been pledged, which primarily 
consists of cash or marketable securities, or by 
transferring the risk to a third-party guarantor in 
another country. 
BNY Mellon has a limited economic interest in the 
performance of assets of consolidated investment 
management funds, and therefore they are excluded 
from this presentation. The liabilities of consolidated 

investment management funds represent the interest 
of the noteholders of the funds and are solely 
dependent on the value of the assets of the funds. 
Any loss in the value of assets of consolidated 
investment management funds would be incurred by 
the fund™s noteholders. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon had exposure of less 
than $1 million in both Portugal and in Greece. At 

Dec. 31, 2012, BNY Mellon had exposure of less than 

$1 million in Portugal and no exposure in Greece. 
Additionally, BNY Mellon had no sovereign exposure 

to the countries disclosed below at Dec. 31, 2012.

Foreign assets are subject to the general risks attendant on the conduct of business in each foreign 
country, including economic uncertainties and each 

foreign government™s regulations.  In addition, our 

foreign assets may be affected by changes in demand 

or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates or other factors. Cross-border 

outstandings include loans, acceptances, interest-
bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments, and other monetary assets which

   (continued)Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under ﬁSummary of significant

instruments and derivatives, other-than-temporary 

impairment, goodwill and other intangibles, and 
pension accounting. Further information on policies 

related to the allowance for loan losses and allowance 
for lending-related commitments can be found under 
ﬁSummary of significant accounting and reporting 
policiesﬂ in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Additionally, further 

information can be found in the Notes to

goodwill and intangible assets can be found in 
ﬁGoodwill and intangible assetsﬂ in Note 6; and 
information on pensions can be found in ﬁEmployee 
benefit plansﬂ in Note 18. Allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments 
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represent 
management™s estimate of probable losses inherent in 

our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is 

subject to numerous estimates and judgments. We utilize a quantitative methodology and qualitative 
framework for determining the allowance for loan 
losses and the allowance for lending-related 
commitments. Within this qualitative framework, 

management applies judgment when assessing 
internal risk factors and environmental factors to 
compute an additional allowance for each component 
of the loan portfolio. The three elements of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments 
include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: Ł an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million or 
greater; Ł an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits; and Ł an allowance for residential mortgage loans. Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. 
As a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 

million. Therefore, the first element, impaired 

credits, is based on individual analysis of all impaired 
loans of $1 million or greater.  The allowance is 

measured by the difference between the recorded 

value of impaired loans and their impaired value. 
Impaired value is either the present value of the 
expected future cash flows from the borrower, the 

market value of the loan, or the fair value of the 
collateral. The second element, higher risk-rated credits and pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 
model. All loans over $1 million are individually 

analyzed before being assigned a credit rating. All 

borrowers are assigned to pools based on their credit 
rating. The probable loss inherent in each loan in a 

pool incorporates the borrower™s credit rating, loss 

given default rating and maturity.  The loss given 

default incorporates a recovery expectation and an 
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage 
given default). The borrower™s probability of default 

is derived from the associated credit rating. Borrower 

ratings are reviewed at least annually and are 
periodically mapped to third-party databases, 
including rating agency and default and recovery 
databases, to ensure ongoing consistency and validity.  

Higher risk-rated credits are reviewed quarterly.  We 

completed our annual update of the allowance 
parameters utilized in our probable loss model to 
calculate the quantitative allowance in the fourth 
quarter of 2013, which increased the quantitative 
allowance by $20 million. The third element, the allowance for residential mortgage loans, is determined by segregating six 
mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging 
from current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 
default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. In 2012, BNY Mellon began 

assigning all residential mortgage pools, except home 
equity lines of credit, a probability of default and loss 
given default based on default and loss data derived 
from our residential mortgage portfolio. Prior to 

2012, estimates of probability of default and loss  34 BNY Mellon 
           (continued) given default factors were based on a combination of external data from third-party databases and internal 
data. The decision to change was triggered when five 

years of historical data became available in 2012. 
The use of internal historical data provides a better 
estimate of the allowance, given that it is based on 
actual default and loss experience on our residential 
mortgage portfolio. The use of internal historical 

default and loss data resulted in a credit to the 
allowance for credit losses of $51 million in 2012. 
For each pool, the inherent loss is calculated using the 
above factors. The resulting probable loss factor (the 

probability of default multiplied by the loss given 
default) is applied against the loan balance to 
determine the allowance held for each pool. For 

home equity lines of credit, probability of default and 
loss given default are based on external data from 
third-party databases due to the small size of the 
portfolio and insufficient internal data. 
The qualitative framework is used to determine an additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 
factors below: Internal risk factors: Ł Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Ł Criticized assets to total loans and lending-related commitments; Ł Ratings volatility; Ł Borrower concentration; and Ł Significant concentration in high risk industries. Environmental risk factors: Ł U.S. non-investment grade default rate; Ł Unemployment rate; and Ł Change in real GDP. 
The objective of the qualitative framework is to 
capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 
captured in the quantitative reserve, which is based 
primarily on historical data. Management determines 

the qualitative allowance each period based on 
judgment informed by consideration of internal and 
external risk factors and other considerations that 
may be deemed relevant during the period. Once 

determined in the aggregate, our qualitative 
allowance is then allocated to each of our loan classes 
based on the respective classes™ quantitative 

allowance balances with the allocations adjusted, 
when necessary, for class specific risk factors.  
For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 
The distribution of historical experience is compared 
to the risk factor™s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the 
portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 
relative to our historical experience. Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level - no impact, low, moderate, high and elevated - to each 

risk factor for the current quarter.  Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine 
an aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the 

impact of any particular risk factor.  Management™s 

assessment of the risk factors, as well as the trend in 
the quantitative allowance, supports management™s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 
allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 
reflected incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. A greater qualitative allowance 

may be required if our quantitative allowance does 
not yet reflect the incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. The methodologies to determine the loss given default, probability of default and usage given default 
allowance parameters utilized in our probable loss 
model to calculate the quantitative allowance were 
updated in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 

management™s judgment, the quantitative allowance 

is now capturing additional incurred losses associated 
with the aggregate risk level in the credit portfolio. 
The update to the allowance parameters included in 
the quantitative allowance resulted in a lower 
qualitative allowance as a percentage of the total 
allowance for credit losses. In 2013, the qualitative 

allowance decreased $30 million primarily driven by 
the improvement in the U.S. housing market and 
internal and environmental risk factors and the 
updates to the allowance parameters in the fourth 
quarter of 2013 described above. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or 
management™s judgment, the allowance for credit 

losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 
The credit rating assigned to each credit is a significant variable in determining the allowance. If 

each credit were rated one grade better, the allowance 

would have decreased by $84 million, while if each 
credit were rated one grade worse, the allowance 
would have increased by $185 million. Similarly, if 

the loss given default were one rating worse, the BNY Mellon 35 
  (continued)allowance would have increased by $30 million, while if the loss given default were one rating better, 

the allowance would have decreased by $29 million. 
For impaired credits, if the net carrying value of the 
loans was 10% higher or lower, the allowance would 

have decreased or increased by $1 million, 
respectively. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The guidance related to Fair Value Measurement 
included in Accounting Standards Codification 
(ﬁASCﬂ) 820 defines fair value, establishes a 
framework for measuring fair value, and expands 
disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value. The standard also established a three-level 

hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the 
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or 
liability as of the measurement date. Fair value - Securities 
Level 1 - Securities - Recent quoted prices from exchange transactions are used for debt and equity securities that are actively traded on exchanges and 
for U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government 

securities that are actively traded in highly liquid 
over-the-counter markets. 
Level 2 - Securities -For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine fair value primarily based on 
pricing sources with reasonable levels of price 
transparency.  The pricing sources employ financial 

models or obtain comparisons to similar instruments 
to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the type of transaction and apply such 
variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as 

observable transactions in the current market place 
and classify such securities as Level 2. In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 
securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 
observed trade price and other information feeds from 
the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 
information is included in the fair value assessment 
for such securities. The pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 
price. The pricing sources did not discontinue pricing 

for any securities in our investment securities 
portfolio at Dec. 31, 2013. 
We obtain prices for our Level 1 and Level 2 
securities from multiple pricing sources. We have 

designed controls to develop an understanding of the 
pricing sources™ securities pricing methodology and 

have implemented specific internal controls over the 
valuation of securities. As appropriate, we review the quality control procedures and pricing methodologies used by the 
pricing sources, including the process for obtaining 
prices provided by the pricing sources, their valuation 
methodology and controls for each class of security. 
Prices received from pricing sources are subject to validation checks that help determine the 
completeness and accuracy of the prices. These 

validation checks are reviewed by management and, 
based on the results, may be subject to additional 
review and investigation. We also review securities 

with no price changes (stale prices) and securities 
with zero values. We have a surveillance process in place to monitor 
the accuracy of prices provided by the pricing 
sources. We utilize a hierarchy that compares 

security prices obtained from multiple pricing sources 
against established thresholds. Discrepancies that fall 

outside of these thresholds are challenged with the 
pricing services and adjusted if necessary.  
If further research is required, we review and validate these prices with the pricing sources. We also 

validate prices from pricing sources by comparing 
prices received to actual observed prices from actions 
such as purchases and sales, when possible. Level 3 - Securities -Where we have used our own cash flow models, which included a significant input  36 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) into the model that was deemed unobservable, to estimate the value of securities, we classify them in 
Level 3 of the ASC 820 hierarchy.  More than 99% of 

our securities are valued by pricing sources with 
reasonable levels of price transparency.  Less than 1% 

of our securities are priced based on economic 
models and non-binding dealer quotes, and are 
included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our securities by ASC 820 

hierarchy level. Fair value - Derivative financial instruments 
Level 1 - Derivative financial instruments -Includes derivative financial instruments that are actively traded on exchanges, principally listed equity options. Level 2 - Derivative financial instruments -Includes the vast majority of our over-the-counter derivative 
financial instruments. Derivatives classified as Level 

2 are valued utilizing discounted cash flow analysis 
and financial models for which the valuation inputs 
are observable or can be corroborated, directly or 
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the 

instrument. Valuation inputs include interest rates, 

foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads, 
option volatilities and other factors. The valuation 

process takes into consideration factors such as 
counterparty credit quality, liquidity and 

concentration concerns. Level 2 over-the-counter 

derivatives generally include interest rate swaps and 
options, foreign exchanges forwards and options, 
forward rate agreements, equity swaps and options, 
and credit default swaps. Level 3 - Derivative financial instruments - Certain derivatives that are highly structured require significant judgment and analyses to adjust the value 
determined by standard pricing models. These 

derivatives are included in Level 3 of the ASC 820 

hierarchy and comprise less than 1% of our derivative 
financial instruments at fair value. To test the appropriateness of the valuations, we 
subject the models to review and approval by an 
independent internal risk management function, 
benchmark the models against similar instruments 
and validate model estimates to actual cash 
transactions. In addition, we perform detailed 

reviews and analyses of profit and loss. Valuation 

adjustments are determined and controlled by a function independent of the area initiating the risk 
position. As markets and products develop and the 

pricing for certain products becomes more 
transparent, we refine our valuation methods. Any 

changes to the valuation models are reviewed by 
management to ensure the changes are justified. To confirm that our valuation policies are consistent 
with exit prices as prescribed by ASC 820, we review 

our derivative valuations using recent transactions in 
the marketplace, pricing services and the results of 
similar types of transactions. In determining fair 

value for these instruments, observable inputs are 
utilized where available as required by ASC 820. 
For details of our derivative financial instruments by ASC 820 hierarchy level, see Note 20 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value option 
ASC 825 provides the option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement basis for selected financial 
assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm 
commitments and written loan commitments which 
are not subject to fair value under other accounting 
standards. Under ASC 825, fair value is used for both 

the initial and subsequent measurement of the 
designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with 
the changes in fair value recognized in income. See 

Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional disclosure regarding the fair 
value option. Fair value - Judgments 
In times of illiquid markets and financial stress, actual prices and valuations may significantly diverge 

from results predicted by models. In addition, other 

factors can affect our estimate of fair value, including 

market dislocations, incorrect model assumptions, 
and unexpected correlations. These valuation 

methods could expose us to materially different 

results should the models used or underlying 
assumptions be inaccurate. See ﬁSummary of 
significant accounting and reporting policiesﬂ in Note 
1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other-than-temporary impairment 

The guidance included in ASC 320 defines the other
than-temporary impairment (ﬁOTTIﬂ) model for 
investments in debt securities. Under this guidance, a 
BNY Mellon 37 
   (continued)debt security is considered impaired if its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. An OTTI is 

triggered if (1) the intent is to sell the security; (2) the 
security will more likely than not have to be sold 
before the impairment is recovered, or (3) the 
amortized cost basis is not expected to be recovered. 
When an entity does not intend to sell the security 
before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the 
credit component of an OTTI of a debt security in 
earnings and the remaining portion in accumulated 
other comprehensive income. The determination of whether a credit loss exists is based on best estimates of the present value of cash 
flows to be collected from the debt security.  

Generally, cash flows are discounted at the effective 

interest rate implicit in the debt security at the time of 
acquisition. For debt securities that are beneficial 

interests in securitized financial assets and are not 
high credit quality, ASC 325 provides that cash flows 

be discounted at the current yield used to accrete the 
beneficial interest. For each security in the investment securities portfolio (including, but not limited to, those whose 
fair value is less than their amortized cost basis), an 
extensive, regular review is conducted to determine if 
an OTTI has occurred. For example, to determine if 

an unrealized loss on non-agency RMBS is other

than-temporary, we project total estimated defaults of 

the underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 
calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 
upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 
in order to determine the projected collateral loss. We 

also evaluate the current credit enhancement 
underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash 
flows. If we determine that a given non-agency 

RMBS will be subject to a write-down or loss, we 
record the expected credit loss as a charge to 

earnings. In recent years, improving home prices helped to stabilize the credit performance of non-agency RMBS 
transactions. This in turn enabled us to maintain 

generally stable assumptions for these transactions 
throughout the year with regard to estimated defaults 
and the amount we expect to receive to cover the 
value of the original loan. See Note 4 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for projected 
weighted-average default rates and loss severities at 
Dec. 31, 2013 and 2012 for the 2007, 2006 and 
late-2005 non-agency RMBS and the securities 
previously held in the Grantor Trust we established in 
connection with the restructuring of our investment 
securities portfolio in 2009. If actual delinquencies, 

default rates and loss severity assumptions worsen, 
we would expect additional impairment losses to be 
recorded in future periods. Net securities gains in 2013 were $141 million compared with $162 million in 2012. The low 

interest rate environment in 2013 created the 
opportunity for us to realize gains as we rebalanced 
and managed the duration risk of the investment 
securities portfolio. At Dec. 31, 2013, if we were to increase each of our projected loss severity and default rates by 100 basis 
points on each of the positions in our Alt-A, subprime 

and prime RMBS portfolios, including the securities 
previously held by the Grantor Trust, credit-related 

impairment charges on these securities would have 

increased by $2 million (pre-tax). If we were to 

decrease each of our projected loss severity and 
default rates by 100 basis points on each of the 
positions, credit-related impairment charges on these 

securities would have been immaterial. Goodwill and other intangibles 
We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired 
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in 
accordance with ASC 805 
Business Combinations. 
Goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and other 
intangibles are subsequently accounted for in 
accordance with ASC 350 
Intangibles - Goodwill and 
Other. 
The initial measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires judgment concerning estimates of 
the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. 
Goodwill ($18.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2013) and 

indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.7 billion at Dec. 

31, 2013) are not amortized but subject to tests for 
impairment annually or more often if events or 
circumstances indicate it is more likely than not they 
may be impaired. Other intangible assets are 

amortized over their estimated useful lives and are 
subject to impairment if events or circumstances 
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying 
amount. BNY Mellon™s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment 
testing is done in accordance with ASC 350.  The 

Investment Management segment is comprised of two 
reporting units; the Investment Services segment is  38 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) comprised of four reporting units; and one reporting unit is included in the Other segment. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step compares the estimated fair 

value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill 
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. 
However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit 

were to exceed its estimated fair value, a second step 
would be performed that would compare the implied 
fair value of the reporting unit™s goodwill with the 

carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment 

loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying 
amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. A 

substantial goodwill impairment charge would not 

have a significant impact on our financial condition, 
but could have an adverse impact on our results of 
operations. In addition, due to regulatory restrictions, 

the Company™s subsidiary banks could be restricted 

from distributing available cash to the Parent 
resulting in the Parent needing to issue additional 
long-term debt. In the second quarter of 2013, we performed our annual goodwill test on all seven reporting units using 
an income approach to estimate the fair values of 
each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in the 

income approach were based on management™s 

projections as of April 1, 2013.  The discount rate 

applied to these cash flows ranged from 10% to 
12.5% and incorporated a 6.75% market equity risk 
premium. Estimated cash flows extend far into the 

future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate 

over such an extended time frame. As of the date of the annual test, the fair values of six of the Company™s reporting units were substantially 

in excess of the respective reporting units™ carrying 

value. The fair value of the Asset Management 

reporting unit, which is one of the two reporting units 
in the Investment Management segment, exceeded its 
carrying value by approximately 25%. The Asset 

Management reporting unit has $7.6 billion of 
allocated goodwill. For the Asset Management 

reporting unit, in the future, small changes in the 
assumptions could produce a non-cash goodwill 
impairment, which would have no effect on our 

regulatory capital ratios. In addition, certain money 

market fee waiver practices and changes in the level 
of assets under management could have an effect on 
Asset Management broadly, as well as the fair value 

of this reporting unit. Key judgments in accounting for intangibles include useful life and classification between goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangibles or other intangibles 
requiring amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair 
values, estimated using discounted cash flow 
analyses, to their carrying values. Other amortizing 

intangible assets ($1.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2013) are 

evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances 
indicate a possible impairment. Such evaluation of 

other intangible assets is initially based on 
undiscounted cash flow projections. See Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual 
and interim impairment testing. Pension accounting 
BNY Mellon has defined benefit pension plans 
covering approximately 19,200 U.S. employees and 
approximately 11,700 non-U.S. employees. 
BNY Mellon has two qualified and several non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. 
and several pension plans overseas. As of Dec. 31, 

2013, the U.S. plans accounted for 78% of the 
projected benefit obligation. The pension expense for 

BNY Mellon plans was $176 million in 2013 

compared with $141 million in 2012 and $93 million 
in 2011. 
A net pension expense of $68 million is expected to 
be recorded by BNY Mellon in 2014, assuming 

currency exchange rates at Dec. 31, 2013.  The 

expected decrease in pension expense in 2014 is 
primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate 
and favorable asset returns for the U.S. plans. The 

discount rate is discussed below. 
A number of key assumption and measurement date 
values determine pension expense. The key elements 

include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the 
discount rate, the market-related value of plan assets 
and the price used to value stock in the Employee 
Stock Ownership Plan (ﬁESOPﬂ). Since 2011, these 

key elements have varied as follows: BNY Mellon 39

accounting and reporting policiesﬂ in Note 1 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. The discount rate for U.S. pension plans was 
determined after reviewing equivalent rates 
obtained by discounting the pension plans™ 
expected cash flows using various high-quality, 

long-term corporate bond yield curves. We also 

reviewed the results of several models that 
matched bonds to our pension cash flows. After 

reviewing the various indices and models, we 
selected a discount rate of 4.99% as of Dec. 31, 

2013. The discount rates for foreign pension plans are based on high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that 
have an active corporate bond market. In those 

countries with no active corporate bond market, 
discount rates are based on local government bond 
rates plus a credit spread. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated returns for each applicable 
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the 

expected allocation for each asset class and are based 
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and 

term historical returns for these markets. We also 

consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global 
economies, as well as current and prospective interest rates. The market-related value of plan assets also influences the level of pension expense. Differences 

between expected and actual returns are recognized 
over five years to compute an actuarially derived 
market-related value of plan assets. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the future service period of active 
employees if they exceed a threshold amount. BNY 

Mellon currently has $1.3 billion of unrecognized 
losses which are being amortized. The annual impacts of hypothetical changes in the key assumptions on pension costs are shown in the 
table below.

Inc.  40 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) At Dec. 31, 2013, total assets were $374 billion 
compared with $359 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  Total 

assets averaged $342 billion in 2013 compared with 

$315 billion in 2012. Fluctuations in the period-end 

and average total assets were primarily driven by the 
level of client deposits. Deposits totaled $261 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $246 billion at Dec. 

31, 2012. Total deposits averaged $226 billion in 

2013 and $204 billion in 2012. At Dec. 31, 2013, 

total interest-bearing deposits were 54% of total 
interest-earning assets compared with 52% at Dec. 

31, 2012. At Dec. 31, 2013, we had $44 billion of liquid funds 
and $111 billion of cash (including $104 billion of 

overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other 
central banks) for a total of $155 billion of available 

funds. This compares with available funds of $145 

billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The increase in available 

funds resulted from an increase in client deposits. 
Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 

was 41% at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 40% at 

Dec. 31, 2012. Of the $44 billion in liquid funds held 

at Dec. 31, 2013, $35 billion was placed in interest-

bearing deposits with large, highly-rated global 

financial institutions with a weighted-average life to 
maturity of approximately 59 days. Of the $35 

billion, $6 billion was placed with banks in the 

Eurozone. Investment securities were $99 billion, or 26% of 
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2013, compared with $101 

billion, or 28% of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2012.  The 

decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the 
unrealized gain on our investment securities portfolio. Trading assets were $12 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 
compared with $9 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The 

increase in trading assets resulted from a higher level 
of securities inventory, primarily U.S. equity 
securities and Agency RMBS, as we expand our 

broker-dealer business. 
Loans were $52 billion, or 14% of total assets, at 
Dec. 31, 2013, compared with $47 billion, or 13% of 

total assets, at Dec. 31, 2012.  The increase in loan 

levels primarily reflects higher loans in the financial 
institutions portfolio, and higher margin loans driven 

by our term loan program. Long-term debt totaled $19.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 
and $18.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The Parent issued 

$3.9 billion of senior debt in 2013, which was 
partially offset by $1.6 billion of maturities, a 

decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt, 
$300 million of repayments of trust preferred 
securities and calls of subordinated debt of $107 
million. Total The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation™s 
shareholders™ equity was $37.5 billion at Dec. 31, 

2013 and $36.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The 

increase primarily reflects earnings retention, higher 
additional paid-in capital resulting from employee 
stock options and awards and employee benefit plan 
contributions, and the issuance of noncumulative 
perpetual preferred stock, partially offset by a decline 

in the value of the investment securities portfolio, net 
of taxes, and share repurchases. Investment securities In the discussion of our investment securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings 
information because the information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, and significant changes in ratings classifications for our investment securities portfolio could indicate 
increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied 
by a reduction in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. BNY Mellon 41

The fair value of our investment securities portfolio 
was $99.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 

$100.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The decrease in the 

fair value of the investment securities portfolio 
primarily reflects a decrease in the unrealized gain on 
our investment securities. Additionally, during 2013, 

we reevaluated the mix of the securities portfolio and 
decreased investments in U.S. Treasury securities, 

European floating rate notes, money market funds, 
foreign covered bonds and commercial paper.  We 

increased investments in sovereign debt, commercial 
MBS, consumer asset-backed securities and state and 
political subdivisions. In 2013, we received $829 

million of paydowns and sold $235 million of sub-
investment grade securities. At Dec. 31, 2013, the total investment securities portfolio had a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $309 

million compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  
The decline in the valuation of the investment 
securities portfolio was primarily driven by an 
increase in long-term interest rates. The unrealized 

net of tax gain on our investment securities available-
for-sale portfolio included in accumulated other 

comprehensive income was $357 million at Dec. 31, 

2013, compared with $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  
At both Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2012, 89% of the 
securities in our portfolio were rated AAA/AA-. 
We routinely test our investment securities for OTTI.

recorded as we reduced the size of the investment securities portfolio and its sensitivity to interest rates. 
In addition, in 2013 Agency RMBS securities with an 

amortized cost of $7.3 billion and fair value of $7.0 billion were transferred from available-for-sale 
securities to held-to-maturity securities. These 
combined actions are expected to mute the impact to our accumulated other comprehensive income in the event of a rise in interest rates. The following table presents pre-tax securities gains (losses) by type. Net securities gains (losses)(in millions) 2013 2012 2011

Equity investments Our equity investments are primarily categorized as other assets. Included in other assets are 
(parenthetical amounts indicate carrying values at 
Dec. 31, 2013): joint ventures and other equity 

investments ($1.6 billion), seed capital ($308 

million), Federal Reserve Bank stock ($441 million), 

private equity investments ($86 million), and tax 

advantaged low-income housing investments ($543 

million).  For additional information on the fair value 

of our private equity investments and certain seed 
capital, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Our equity investment in Wing Hang, which is 
located in Hong Kong, had a fair value of $963 
million (book value of $535 million) based on its 
share price at Dec. 31, 2013.  Equity income related 
to our investment in Wing Hang totaled $95 million 

in 2013, including $37 million from the sale of a property.  Equity income totaled $44 million in 2012 
BNY Mellon 43 
  €€  (continued)and $53 million in 2011.  An agreement with certain 
other shareholders of Wing Hang prohibits the sale of 

this interest without their permission. We received 

stock dividends from Wing Hang with a value of $13 

million (or 1.4 million shares) in 2013, $14 million 

(or 1.5 million shares) in 2012 and $12 million (or 1.1 

million shares) in 2011, as well as cash dividends of 

$4 million in 2013.  No cash dividends were received 

in 2012 or 2011.  
Private equity activities consist of investments in private equity funds, mezzanine financings, and direct 
equity investments. Consistent with our policy to 

focus on our core activities, we continue to reduce 
our exposure to these activities. The carrying and fair 

value of our private equity investments was $86 

million at Dec. 31, 2013, down $13 million from $99 
Loans million at Dec. 31, 2012.  At Dec. 31, 2013, private 
equity investments consisted of investments in private 
equity funds of $63 million, direct equity of less than 

$15 million, and leveraged bond funds of $8 million.  

Income on these investments was $6 million in 2013. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, we had $31 million of unfunded investment commitments to private equity funds. If 

unused, the commitments expire between 2014 and 
2017. Commitments to private equity limited partnerships may extend beyond the expiration period shown 
above to cover certain follow-on investments, claims 
and liabilities, and organizational and partnership

an increase of 9% from $85.3 billion at Dec. 31, 

2012. The increase in total exposure was generally 

broad-based across most portfolios and reflects: Łloan growth in Private Wealth, margin secured 
lending to financial institutions and trade finance; 
and Łan increase in unfunded commitments resulting 
from a renewed effort to grow our credit portfolio 
to support client relationships where revenue 
growth opportunities exist. Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios 
comprise our largest concentrated risk.  These 

portfolios made up 57% of our total lending exposure 
at Dec. 31, 2013 and 55% at Dec. 31, 2012. 
Additionally, a substantial portion of our overdrafts 

relate to financial institutions and commercial 
customers.  44 BNY Mellon

$ 27.0 
The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $31.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $27.0 

billion€at Dec. 31, 2012.  The increase primarily 

reflects higher exposure to banks driven by a higher 
level of trade finance loans. Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 
93% of the exposures meeting the investment grade 
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating 
classification at Dec. 31, 2013.  Each customer is 

assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to 
an equivalent external rating agency grade based 
upon a number of dimensions which are continually 
evaluated and may change over time. The exposure 

to financial institutions is generally short-term. Of 

these exposures, 67% expire within one year, and 

35% expire within 90 days. In addition, 36% of the 

financial institutions exposure is secured. For 

example, securities industry and asset managers often 
borrow against marketable securities held in custody. 
For ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, as a 
conservative measure, our internal credit rating is 
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the 
sovereign rating of the country where the 
counterparty resides regardless of the internal credit 
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying 
collateral. Our bank exposure primarily relates to our global trade finance and U.S. dollar-clearing businesses.  

These exposures are predominately to investment 
grade counterparties and are short term in nature. The asset manager portfolio exposures are high-quality, with 97% of the exposures meeting our 

investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec. 

31, 2013. These exposures are generally short-term 

liquidity facilities, with the vast majority to regulated 
mutual funds. Commercial

 (continued)The commercial portfolio exposure increased 7% to 
$21.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2013, from $19.7 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012, reflecting an increase in all segments 
of our commercial portfolio. The table below summarizes the percentage of the financial institutions and commercial portfolio

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade 
names to support cross-selling opportunities and 
avoid single name/industry concentrations and our 
goal is to maintain a predominantly investment grade 
loan portfolio. The execution of our strategy has 

resulted in 93% of our financial institutions portfolio 
and 94% of our commercial portfolio rated as 
investment grade at Dec. 31, 2013. 
Wealth management loans and mortgages 

Our wealth management exposure was $11.5 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $10.6 billion at Dec. 

31, 2012. The increase primarily reflects growth in 

the wealth management mortgage portfolio. Wealth 

management loans and mortgages are primarily 
comprised of loans to high-net-worth individuals, 
which are secured by marketable securities and/or 
residential property.  Wealth management mortgages 

are primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages 
with an average loan to value ratio of 64% at 

origination. In the wealth management portfolio, 1% 

of the mortgages were past due at Dec. 31, 2013. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, the wealth management mortgage portfolio was comprised of the following geographic 
concentrations: New York - 21%; California - 21%; 

Massachusetts - 16%; Florida - 8%; and other - 34%. 
Commercial real estate 

Our income producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on experienced owners and are 
structured with moderate leverage based on existing 
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending 

activities also include construction and renovation 
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced 

developers and long-term holders of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or 
projected cash flows, and supported by appraisals and 
knowledge of local market conditions. Development 

loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in 
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the 
developer.  Our commercial real estate exposure 

totaled $4.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 

$3.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, 59% of our commercial real estate portfolio was secured. The secured portfolio is 

diverse by project type, with 54% secured by 

residential buildings, 15% secured by office 

buildings, 12% secured by retail properties, and 19% 

secured by other categories. Approximately 99% of 

the unsecured portfolio is comprised of real estate 
investment trusts (ﬁREITsﬂ), which are primarily 

investment grade, and real estate operating 
companies. At Dec. 31, 2013, our commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of the following 
concentrations: New York metro - 45%; REITs and 

real estate operating companies - 40%; and other - 

15%. Lease financings 
The leasing portfolio exposure totaled $2.3 billion 
and included $166 million of airline exposures at 

Dec. 31, 2013, compared with $2.4 billion of leasing 

exposures, including $191 million of airline 

exposures, at Dec. 31, 2012. At Dec. 31, 2013, 

approximately 87% of the leasing exposure was 

investment grade. At Dec. 31, 2013, the $2.1 billion non-airline lease 
financing portfolio consisted of exposures backed by 
well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket 

transportation equipment. The largest component is 

rail, consisting of both passenger and freight trains. 
Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with 
primary concentrations in the United States and 
Germany.  Approximately 49% of the non-airline 

portfolio is additionally secured by highly rated 
securities and/or letters of credit from investment 
grade issuers. Excluding airline lease financing, 

counterparty rating equivalents at Dec. 31, 2013, 

were as follows: Ł 61% of the counter parties were A, or equivalent; 
Ł 32% were BBB; and Ł 7% were non-investment grade.  46 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) At Dec. 31, 2013, our $166 million of exposure to the 
airline industry consisted of $68 million to major U.S. 

carriers, $74 million to foreign airlines and $24 

million to U.S. regional airlines. 
Our airline lease customers participated in the industry recovery that continued in 2013. However, a 

significant portion of these customers remain highly 
leveraged and vulnerable to both economic 
downturns and rising fuel prices. Because of these 

factors, we continue to maintain a sizable allowance 
for loan losses against these exposures and to closely 
monitor the portfolio. We utilize the lease financing portfolio as part of our 
tax management strategy. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 
totaled $1.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2013, compared with 

$1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  Included in this 

portfolio at Dec. 31, 2013 are $411 million of 

mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 
quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 
mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  

As of Dec. 31, 2013, the purchased loans in this 

portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 
of 76% at origination and 20% of the serviced loan 

balance was at least 60 days delinquent. The 

properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage 

loans were located (in order of concentration) in 
California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New 

York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland. 
To determine the projected loss on the prime and Alt-

A mortgage portfolios, we calculate the total 

estimated defaults of these mortgages and multiply 
that amount by an estimate of realizable value upon 
sale in the marketplace (severity). Overdrafts 

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in 

the custody and securities clearance business and are 
generally repaid within two business days. Other loans 
Other loans primarily includes loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual 
funds and fixed income securities, as well as bankers™ 
acceptances. Margin loans 

Margin loans are collateralized with marketable 
securities and borrowers are required to maintain a 
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value 

of the loan. Margin loans included $6.7 billion of 

loans at Dec. 31, 2013 and $5.1 billion at Dec. 31, 

2012 related to a term loan program that offers fully 

collateralized loans to broker-dealers.

outstanding international loans of $12.5 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2013 and $9.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  The 

increase primarily resulted from an increase in loans 
to financial institutions, primarily banks, partially 
offset by lower overdrafts. 
Matter related to Sentinel 

In August 2007, BNY Mellon loaned $312 million  to 
an asset manager, Sentinel Management Group, Inc. 

(ﬁSentinelﬂ), secured by securities and cash. Sentinel 

filed for bankruptcy in 2007, and BNY Mellon™s 

status as a secured lender is the subject of continuing 
litigation. In 2010, the district court ruled in favor of 

BNY Mellon, and the loan was repaid.  An appellate 

court reversed the district court™s ruling on Aug. 26, 

2013, and remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings. BNY Mellon held no loans to Sentinel 

at Dec. 31, 2013. On Jan. 22, 2014, the Bankruptcy 
 48 BNY Mellon 
     (continued) Court, ordered that the funds distributed to BNY Mellon after the district court™s favorable decision be 

returned to the bankruptcy estate and held in a reserve 
earmarked for purposes of BNY Mellon™s claim until 

the district court issues its decision on the merits of 
the challenges to BNY Mellon™s lien.  Accordingly, 

the loan was reestablished as a fully collateralized 
performing loan in the first quarter of 2014. A total 

of $337 million, representing the loan and accrued 
interest, was recorded on Feb. 5, 2014. The ongoing 

litigation could result in a ruling adverse to BNY 
Mellon at some point in the future. For additional 

information on our legal proceedings related to this 
matter, see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. Asset quality and allowance for credit losses Over the past several years, we have improved our risk profile through greater focus on clients who are 

emphasizing broad-based loan growth. Our primary 

exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of 
funded loans, unfunded formal contractual 
commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and 
overdrafts associated with our custody and securities 
clearance businesses. The role of credit has shifted to one that complements our other services instead of as a lead product. We 

believe credit solidifies customer relationships and, 
through a disciplined allocation of capital, can earn 
acceptable rates of return as part of an overall 
relationship. The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses. BNY Mellon 49

million in 2013 primarily driven by a broad 

improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
and a reduction in our qualitative allowance. The 

provision for credit losses was a credit of $80 million 

in 2012 and a provision of $1 million in 2011.  We 

anticipate the quarterly provision for credit losses to 
be $0 to $15 million in 2014. The total allowance for credit losses was $344 million 
at Dec. 31, 2013 and $387 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  

The ratio of the total allowance for credit losses to 
non-margin loans was 0.96% at Dec. 31, 2013, 1.16% 

at Dec. 31, 2012 and 1.59% at Dec. 31, 2011.  The 

ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-margin 
 50 BNY Mellon 
     
 (continued) loans was 0.58% at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 
0.80% at Dec. 31, 2012 and 1.26% at Dec. 31, 2011.  

The decrease in the total allowance for credit losses 
and the lower ratios at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 

both prior periods primarily reflect a decrease in the 
reserve for credit losses related to the residential 
mortgage and lease financing portfolios. We had $15.7 billion of secured margin loans on our 
balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $13.4 

billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  We have rarely suffered a 

loss on these types of loans and do not allocate any of 
our allowance for credit losses to them. As a result, 

we believe that the ratio of total allowance for credit 
losses as a percentage of non-margin loans is a more 

appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the 
reserve. Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit 
losses as discussed in ﬁCritical accounting estimatesﬂ 
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for 
credit losses as follows: Allocation of allowance 2013 2012 2011 2010€(a) 2009€(a) Commercial 24% 27% 18% 16% 25% Other residential mortgages 16 23 31 41 26 Foreign 16 12 12 11 8 Financial institutions 14 9 13 2 12 Commercial real estate 12 8 7 7 7 Lease financing 11 13 13 16 13 Wealth management

inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
regardless of the nature of the loss. Nonperforming assets The following table shows the distribution of nonperforming assets at the end of each of the last five years.

Dec. 31, 2011 and $218 million at Dec. 31, 2010.  These loans are recorded at fair value and therefore do not impact the provision for

an increase of 6% compared with $246.1 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012. The increase in deposits reflects 

higher levels of both foreign and domestic interest-
bearing deposits primarily resulting from higher 
client deposits in our Investment Services business. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $95.5 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $93.0 billion at Dec. 

31, 2012. Interest-bearing deposits were $165.7 

billion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $153.1 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2012. The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign customers in domestic offices was $8.5 billion and 

$6.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Deposits in foreign offices totaled $119.4 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2013, and $107.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. 
The majority of these deposits were in amounts in 
excess of $100,000 and were primarily overnight 
foreign deposits. The following table shows the maturity breakdown of domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more at Dec.

comprised of federal funds purchased and securities

customers and broker-dealers, commercial paper and 

other borrowed funds. Certain other borrowings, for 

example, securities sold under repurchase

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our Investment Services businesses and borrowings under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts 
typically relate to timing differences for settlements.  
Other borrowed funds were $663 million at Dec. 31, 
2013 compared with $844 million at Sept. 30, 2013 

and $1.4 billion Dec. 31, 2012. Other borrowed 

funds averaged $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 

2013, $1.0 billion in the third quarter of 2013 and 

$1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The 

maximum daily balance in the fourth quarter of 2013 

was $7.4 billion compared with $3.7 billion in the 

third quarter of 2013 and $2.1 billion in the fourth 

quarter of 2012. Changes from prior periods 

primarily reflect higher overdrafts of sub-custodian 
account balances in our Investment Services 
businesses. BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the 
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or 
convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, 

especially during periods of market stress. Liquidity 

risk is the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash 

and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both 
expected and unexpected cash flows, without 
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial 

condition. Liquidity risk can arise from cash flow 

mismatches, market constraints from the inability to 
convert assets to cash, inability to raise cash in the 
markets, deposit run-off, or contingent liquidity 

events. For additional information on our liquidity policy, see 
ﬁRisk Management - Liquidity riskﬂ. Our overall approach to liquidity management is to ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 

amount and diversity such that changes in funding 
requirements at the Parent and at the various bank  54 BNY Mellon 
  €(continued) subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 
or our financial condition. BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments 
and seeks to diversify funding sources by line of 
business, customer and market segment. 
Additionally, we seek to maintain liquidity ratios 

within approved limits and liquidity risk tolerance, 
maintain a liquid asset buffer that can be liquidated, 

financed and/or pledged as necessary, and control the 

levels and sources of wholesale funds. Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of customer deposits and client drawdowns on 
unfunded credit or liquidity facilities. We actively 

monitor unfunded lending-related commitments, 
thereby reducing unanticipated funding 
requirements. When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics in order to have ample liquidity for expected 
and unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 

mismatches, asset maturities, debt spreads, peer 
ratios, liquid assets, unencumbered collateral, funding 
sources and balance sheet liquidity ratios. Internal ratios we currently monitor as part of our standard analysis include total loans as a percentage 
of total deposits, deposits as a percentage of total 
interest-earning assets, foreign deposits as a 
percentage of total interest-earning assets, purchased 
funds as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, 
liquid assets as a percentage of total interest-earning 
assets, liquid assets as a percentage of purchased 
funds, and discount window collateral and central 
bank deposits as a percentage of total deposits. All of 

these internal ratios exceeded our minimum guidelines at Dec. 31, 2013.  In addition, we monitor 

the revised Basel III liquidity coverage ratio and 
continue to evaluate the U.S. banking agencies™ 
proposal for the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio 
(ﬁLCRﬂ). We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 

under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are 

based on scenarios that measure liquidity risks 
under unlikely but plausible events. The Company 

performs these tests under various time horizons 
ranging from one day to one year in a base case, as 
well as supplemental tests to determine whether the 
Company™s liquidity is sufficient for severe market 

events and firm-specific events. Under our 

scenario testing program, the results of the tests 
indicate that the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
Commencing January 2015, we will also be subject to the liquidity requirements of the Federal Reserve™s 

heightened prudential standards for BHCs with total 
consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, described 
under ﬁSupervision and Regulation - Enhanced 
Prudential Standardsﬂ. We define available funds as liquid funds (which 
include interest-bearing deposits with banks and 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements), cash and due from banks, and 
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks. The table below presents our 

total available funds including liquid funds at period-
end and on an average basis. The higher level of 

available funds at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with Dec. 

31, 2012 primarily resulted from a higher level of 
client deposits and attractive overnight borrowing 
opportunities. Available and liquid funds (in millions) Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 2013 Average 2012 2011 Available funds: Liquid funds: Interest-bearing deposits with banks $ 35,300

    (continued)On an average basis for 2013 and 2012, non-core 
sources of funds such as money market rate accounts, 
federal funds purchased, trading liabilities, 
commercial paper and other borrowings were $21.3 
billion and $20.5 billion, respectively.  The increase 

primarily reflects higher levels of trading liabilities 
and federal funds purchased, partially offset by lower 

levels of money market rate accounts. Average 

foreign deposits, primarily from our European-based 
Investment Services business, were $101.3 billion for 
2013 compared with $90.9 billion for 2012.  The 

increase primarily reflects growth in client deposits. 
Domestic savings, interest-bearing demand and time 
deposits averaged $45.2 billion for 2013 compared 

with $36.5 billion for 2012.  The increase primarily 

reflects higher time and interest-bearing demand 
deposits. Average payables to customers and broker-dealers 
were $9.0 billion for 2013 and $8.0 billion for 2012.  

Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven 

by customer trading activity and market volatility.  

Long-term debt averaged $19.1 billion for 2013 and 

$19.9 billion for 2012.  

term debt was driven by debt maturities and a 
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt. 
Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to 

$73.3 billion for 2013 from $70.0 billion for 2012 

reflecting growth in client deposits. A significant 

reduction in our Investment Services business would 
reduce our access to deposits. See ﬁAsset/liability 

managementﬂ for additional factors that could impact 
our deposit balances. The Parent has four major sources of liquidity: 
Ł cash on hand; Ł dividends from its subsidiaries; Ł access to the commercial paper market; and Ł access to the debt and equity markets. Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2013, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 
approximately $2.9 billion, without the need for a 
regulatory waiver.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2013, non-

bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 
approximately $1.9 billion. In April 2013, BNY Mellon announced a 15% 
increase in the quarterly common stock cash dividend 
from $0.13 to $0.15 per common share. Our common 

stock dividend payout ratio was 33% for the full-year 

of 2013, or 26% after adjusting for the net impact of the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions regarding certain 

foreign tax credits. The Federal Reserve™s current 

guidance provides that, for large bank holding 

companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 
30% of after-tax net income will receive particularly 

close scrutiny.  
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in 
ﬁSupervision and Regulation - Capital Planning and 
Stress Testing - Payment of Dividends, Stock 

Repurchases and Other Capital Distributionsﬂ and in 
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. In 2013 and 2012, the Parent™s average commercial 
paper borrowings were $690 million and $819 
million, respectively.  The Parent had cash of $6.8 

billion at Dec. 31, 2013, compared with $4.0 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2012. In addition to issuing commercial 

paper for funding purposes, the Parent issues 
commercial paper, on an overnight basis, to certain 

custody clients with excess demand deposit balances. 
Overnight commercial paper outstanding issued by 
the Parent was $96 million at Dec. 31, 2013 and $338 

million at Dec. 31, 2012.  Net of commercial paper 

outstanding, the Parent™s cash position at Dec. 31, 

2013, increased by $3.0 billion compared with Dec. 

31, 2012, primarily reflecting the issuance of senior 
medium term notes, preferred stock and dividends 
from its subsidiaries, partially offset by maturities of 

long-term debt and common share repurchases. The Parent™s major uses of funds are payment of 
dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal 
and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions 
and additional investments in its subsidiaries. In 2013, we repurchased 35.1 million common shares 
at an average price of $29.24 per common share for a 

total of $1.03 billion. 
The Parent™s liquidity policy is to have sufficient 
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents on hand to 
meet its forecasted debt redemptions, net interest 
payments and net tax payments over the next 18 to 24 
months without the need to receive dividends from its 
bank subsidiaries or issue debt. As of Dec. 31, 2013, 

the Parent was in compliance with its liquidity policy. 
In addition to our other funding sources, we also have the ability to access the capital markets. In June 

2013, we filed shelf registration statements on Form  56 BNY Mellon 
 €€€€    (continued) S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) covering the issuance of certain securities, 
including an unlimited amount of debt, common 
stock, preferred stock and trust preferred securities, as 
well as common stock issued under the Direct Stock 
Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plans. These 

registration statements will expire in June 2016, at 
which time we plan to file new shelf registration 
statements. Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit 
ratings, which, as of Dec. 31, 2013, were as follows: Credit ratings Moody™s S&P Fitch DBRS Parent: Long-term senior debt A1 A+ AA€(low) Subordinated debt A2 A A+ A (high) Preferred stock Baa2 BBB BBB A (low) Trust-preferredsecurities A3 BBB BBB+ A (high) Short-term debt P1 A-1 F1+ R-1 (middle) Outlook - Parent: Stable Negative Stable Stable The Bank of New York Mellon:

As a result of S&P™s government support assumptions 
on certain U.S. financial institutions, the Parent™s 

ratings by S&P benefit from one notch of ﬁliftﬂ.  

Similarly, The Bank of New York Mellon™s and BNY 

Mellon, N.A.™s ratings benefit from two notches of 

ﬁliftﬂ from Moody™s Investor Service (ﬁMoody™sﬂ) 

and one notch of ﬁliftﬂ from S&P.  In June 2013, S&P 

indicated that they are reconsidering the inclusion of 
assumed government support in its ratings on the 
eight U.S. bank holding companies that they view as 
having high systemic importance, including The Bank 

of New York Mellon Corporation. 
On Nov. 14, 2013, Moody™s concluded its previously 
announced reviews of the three large U.S. trust and 

custody banks™ long-term ratings.€ As a result of these 

reviews, which included both U.S. government support ratings, and stand-alone ratings, Moody™s 

downgraded all three of the large U.S. trust and 

custody banks. Moody™s downgraded our ratings and 

those of The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A. by one notch.€Our short-term ratings 

and those of The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A. were unchanged. For further discussion 

on the impact of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 
23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-term debt totaled $19.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 
and $18.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. In 2013, the 
Parent issued $3.9 billion of senior debt, partially 
offset by maturities of $1.6 billion, a decrease in the 

fair value of hedged long-term debt and $300 million 
of repayments of trust preferred securities. The fair 

value of the derivatives hedging long-term debt is 
recorded in other assets. Additionally, the Parent 

called $107 million of subordinated debt in 2013.

interest rate of 2.2%, $750 million of senior medium-
term notes maturing in 2024 at an annual interest rate 
of 3.65% and $200 million of senior medium-term 

month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. The Parent has $4.37 billion of long-term debt that will mature in 2014 and has the option to call $300 
million of subordinated debt in 2014, which it may 
call and refinance if market conditions are favorable BNY Mellon 57 
     (continued)In 2013, we issued 500,000 depositary shares (the ﬁSeries D depositary sharesﬂ), each representing a 
1/100th ownership interest in a share of Series D 
Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a 
liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (the 
ﬁSeries D preferred stockﬂ), of The Bank of New 

York Mellon Corporation.  BNY Mellon will pay a 

dividend on the Series D preferred stock if declared 
by our board of directors, at an annual rate of 4.5% 
on each June 20 and December 20, to but excluding 
June 20, 2023; and a floating rate equal to three-
month LIBOR plus 2.46% on each March 20, June 
20, September 20 and December 20, from and 
including June 20, 2023. The proceeds of the 

offering totaled $494 million, net of issuance costs, a 

portion of which was used to redeem $300 million of 
7.78% Trust Preferred Securities of BNY Institutional 

Capital Trust A. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, we had $330 million of trust 
preferred securities outstanding. Under the Final 

Capital Rules, these trust-preferred securities may 
continue to be included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital up 

to the following percentages: calendar year 2014 -
50%; calendar year 2015 - 25%; and calendar year 
2016 and beyond - 0%. Any decision to take action 

with respect to these trust preferred securities will be 
based on several considerations including interest 
rates, the availability of cash and capital, as well as 
the implementation of the Final Capital Rules. The double leverage ratio is the ratio of investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated equity, 

which includes our noncumulative perpetual 
preferred stock plus trust preferred securities. Our 

double leverage ratio was 109.4% at Dec. 31, 2013 

and 109.9% at Dec. 31, 2012.  The double leverage 

ratio is monitored by regulators and rating agencies 
and is an important constraint on our ability to invest 
in our subsidiaries and expand our businesses. Pershing LLC, an indirect subsidiary of BNY Mellon, 
has committed and uncommitted lines of credit in 
place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by 
the Parent. The committed line of credit of $750 

million extended by 16 financial institutions matures 
in March 2014. There were no borrowings against 

this line in 2013.  Pershing LLC has nine separate 

uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $1.6 billion 
in aggregate. Average daily borrowing under these 

lines was $8 million, in aggregate, in 2013. 
The committed line of credit maintained by Pershing 
LLC requires the Parent to maintain: Łshareholders™ equity of $5 billion; 
Ła ratio of Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for 
credit losses to nonperforming assets of at least 
2.5; and Ła double leverage ratio less than 130%. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. 
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has uncommitted lines of credit in 

place for liquidity purposes, which are guaranteed by 
the Parent. Pershing Limited has two separate 

uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $250 
million in aggregate. Average daily borrowing under 

these lines was $62 million, in aggregate, in 2013. 
Statement of cash flows 
Cash used for operating activities was $642 million in 2013 compared with cash provided by operations of 
$1.6 billion in 2012 and $2.2 billion in 2011.  In 

2013, cash flows used for operations were principally 
changes in trading activities and accruals, partially 
offset by earnings.  In 2012, cash flows from 

operations were principally the result of earnings, 
partially offset by changes in trading activities.  In 

2011, the cash flows from operations were principally 

the result of earnings. In 2013, cash used for investing activities was $13.2 billion compared with $29.4 billion in 2012 and $80.2 

billion in 2011.  In 2013, purchases of securities, 

changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks, loans and federal 
funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements were a significant use of funds, partially 
offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities 

and a decrease in interest-bearing deposits with 
banks. In 2012, purchases of securities, and increases 

in interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially 
offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of securities, 

were significant uses of funds. In 2011, increases in 

interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks, and the purchase of 
securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest-

bearing deposits with banks and sales, paydowns and 
maturities of securities, were significant uses of 
funds.  58 BNY Mellon 
   (continued) In 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $15.6 billion compared with $28.3 billion for 2012 

and $78.8 billion in 2011.  In 2013, an increase in 


term debt and changes in federal funds purchased and 
securities sold under repurchase agreements were 
significant sources of funds, partially offset by the 

repayment of long-term debt and common stock 
repurchases. In 2012, increases in deposits and 

payables to customers and broker dealers were 
significant sources of funds. In 2011, proceeds from 

issuances of long-term debt and increases in deposits 
and payables to customers and broker-dealers were 

significant sources of funds. We have contractual obligations to make fixed and 
determinable payments to third parties as indicated in

Total The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 

shareholders™ equity at Dec. 31, 2013 increased to 

$37.5 billion from $36.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  

The increase primarily reflects earnings retention, 
approximately $500 million resulting from the 
exercise of stock options and awards and employee 
benefit plan contributions, an increase in the value of 
our pension assets and the issuance of $500 million of 
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, partially 
offset by a decline in the value of our investment 

securities portfolio and share repurchases. 
The unrealized net of tax gain on our available-for

sale investment securities portfolio recorded in 
accumulated other comprehensive income was $357 
million at Dec. 31, 2013, compared with $1.3 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2012. The decrease in the valuation of the 

investment securities portfolio was driven by an 
increase in long-term interest rates. In 2013, we repurchased 35.1 million common shares 

at an average price of $29.24 per common share for a 

total of $1.03 billion.  Under the 2013 capital plan, 

we are authorized to repurchase $385 million worth 
of common shares in the first quarter of 2014. 
Through Feb. 27, 2014, we repurchased 10.6 million 

common shares at an average price of $32.41 per 

common share for a total of $345 million. 
On Jan. 17, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share. 
This cash dividend was paid on Feb. 7, 2014, to

by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013, on a fully phased-in basis. For periods prior to Dec. 31, 2013, these ratios were estimated 

using our interpretations of the NPRs dated June 7, 2012, on a fully phased-in basis.  Both the Final Capital Rules and the NPRs 

require the Tier 1 common equity ratio to be the lower of the Standardized Approach or Advanced Approach.  At Dec. 31, 2012, the 

ratio was higher under the Standardized Approach, and therefore was presented under the Advanced Approach. 
(b)See ﬁSupplemental Information - Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measuresﬂ beginning on page 118 for a calculation of 

these ratios. (c) On a fully phased-in basis, we expect to satisfy a minimum Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 7%, 4.5% attributable to a 

minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio and 2.5% attributable to a capital conservation buffer (expected to rise to 8%, assuming an 

additional G-SIB buffer of 1%). (d) Changes in January 2014 to the probable loss model associated with unsecured wholesale credit exposures within our Advanced 

Approach capital model will impact risk-wighted assets.  The Company did not include the impact at Dec. 31, 2013. However, a 

preliminary estimate of the revised methodology to the portfolio at Sept. 30, 2013 would have added approximately 6% to the risk-

weighted assets. (e) When in this Annual Report we refer to BNY Mellon™s or our bank subsidiary™s ﬁBasel Iﬂ capital measures (e.g., Basel I Total capital or 

Basel I Tier 1 capital), we mean that capital measure, as calculated under the Federal Reserve™s risk-based capital rules that are based 

on the 1988 Basel Accord, which is often referred to as ﬁBasel Iﬂ.  Similarly, when in this Annual Report we refer to BNY Mellon™s 

ﬁBasel IIIﬂ capital measures (e.g., Basel III Tier 1 common equity), we mean that capital measure as calculated under the Final 

Capital Rules released by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013.  Includes full capital credit for certain capital instruments outstanding

2013 compared with 15.0% at Dec. 31, 2012.  Our 

Basel I Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4% at Dec. 31, 

2013 and 5.3% at Dec. 31, 2012. The increases in 
these ratios primarily reflect earnings retention and 
the issuance of noncumulative perpetual preferred 
stock, partially offset by share repurchases and the 

redemption of trust-preferred securities. The Basel I 

Tier 1 capital ratio was also impacted by an increase 

in risk-weighted assets, while the Basel I Tier 1 

leverage ratio was impacted by an increase in average 
assets. The leverage ratio of The Bank of New York 

Mellon was 5.3% at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 

5.4% at Dec. 31, 2012. The decrease in the leverage 

ratio of The Bank of New York Mellon reflects an 

increase in average assets. The Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios for The 

Bank of New York Mellon increased at Dec. 31, 2013 

compared with Dec. 31, 2012.  The increases in these 

ratios primarily reflect earnings retention, partially 
offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets.

    (continued) At Dec. 31, 2013, we had $330 million of trust 

preferred securities outstanding which currently 
qualify as Tier 1 capital.  Any decision to take action 

with respect to these trust preferred securities will be 
based on several considerations including interest 
rates, the availability of cash and capital, as well as 
the implementation of the Final Capital Rules. Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ status or capital adequacy rules 
more generally, could result in limitations on our 

activities and adversely affect our financial condition.  

See the discussion of these matters in ﬁSupervision 
and Regulation-Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon 

and Ancillary Regulatory Requirementsﬂ and ﬁRisk 

Factors-Operational and Business Risk-Failure to 
satisfy regulatory standards, including ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ status or capital 
adequacy rules more generally, could result in 

limitations on our activities and adversely affect our 

business and financial condition.ﬂ Capital ratios vary depending on the size of the balance sheet at quarter-end and the level and types of 

investments in assets. The balance sheet size 

fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on levels of 
customer and market activity.  In general, when 

servicing clients are more actively trading securities, 
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are 
higher.  In addition, when markets experience 

significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size

market maker for our customers and facilitating 
customer trades. Positions managed for our own 

account are immaterial to our foreign exchange and 
other trading revenue and to our overall results of 
operations. The risk from market-making activities 

for customers is managed by our traders and limited 
in total exposure through a system of position limits, 
a value-at-risk (ﬁVaRﬂ) methodology based on a 

Monte Carlo simulation, stop loss advisory triggers, 
and other market sensitivity measures. The 

calculation of our VaR used by management and 

presented below assumes a one-day holding period, 
utilizes a 99% confidence level, and incorporates the 
non-linear characteristics of options. See Note 23 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information on the VaR methodology.

the impact of the Company™s consolidated investment 

management funds and seed capital investments. N/M - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different 
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to 

compute a portfolio diversification effect. The interest rate component of VaR represents 

instruments whose values predominantly vary with 
the level or volatility of interest rates. These 

instruments include, but are not limited to: debt 
securities, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, 
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded The foreign exchange component of VaR represents 

instruments whose values predominantly vary with 
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or 
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not 

limited to: currency balances, spot and forward 
transactions, currency options, and exchange-traded 
futures and options, and other currency derivative 
products. The equity component of VaR is comprised of 
instruments that represent an ownership interest in the 
form of domestic and foreign common stock or other 
equity-linked instruments. These instruments 

include, but are not limited to: common stock, 
exchange-traded funds, Depositary Receipts, listed 
equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, 
equity total return swaps, equity index futures and 
other equity derivative products. The diversification component of VaR is the risk 
reduction benefit that occurs when combining 
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the 

correlated behavior of risk factor movements. During 2013, interest rate risk generated 75% of 
average VaR, equity risk generated 18% of average 

VaR and foreign exchange risk accounted for 7% of 

average VaR.  During 2013, our daily trading loss did 

not exceed our calculated VaR amount of the overall 

portfolio on any given day. 
The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss illustrates the number of trading days in which 
our trading revenue or loss fell within particular 
ranges during the past five quarters. The dispersion 

of trading results was wider year-over-year reflecting 

fluctuations in foreign exchange revenue due mainly 
to changes in market volatility impacting spreads, 
changes in interest rates and the inclusion of CVA and 

overnight index swap (ﬁOISﬂ) curve discounting,

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $674 million in 2013 and $692 million in 2012.  In 

2013, foreign exchange revenue totaled $608 million, 

an increase of 17% compared with $520 million in 

2012 driven by higher volumes and volatility.  Other 

trading revenue totaled $66 million in 2013 compared 

with $172 million in 2012.  The decrease primarily 

reflects lower fixed income trading revenue due to 
lower derivatives trading revenue and a loss on 
inventory driven by higher interest rates. Foreign 

exchange revenue and fixed income trading revenue 
is reported in the Investment Services business and 
the Other segment. Equity/other trading revenue is 

primarily reported in the Other segment. Trading assets include debt and equity instruments 
and derivative assets, primarily interest rate and 
foreign exchange contracts, not designated as hedging 
instruments. Trading assets were $12 billion at Dec. 

31, 2013 compared with $9 billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  

The increase in trading assets primarily resulted from 
a higher level of securities inventory, primarily U.S. 

equity securities and Agency RMBS as we expand 

our broker-dealer business. 
Trading liabilities include debt and equity 
instruments, and derivative liabilities, primarily 
interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, not 
designated as hedging instruments. Trading liabilities 

were $7 billion at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $8 

billion at Dec. 31, 2012.  
Under our mark-to-market methodology for derivative contracts, an initial ﬁrisk-neutralﬂ valuation 
is performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve.  In addition, 
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of 
our derivatives. As required by ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements 
and Disclosures
, we reflect external credit ratings as 
well as observable credit default swap spreads for 
both ourselves as well as our counterparties when 
measuring the fair value of our derivative positions. 
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions 

is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit 
spreads, as well as those of our counterparties. In 

addition, in cases where a counterparty is deemed 
impaired, further analyses are performed to value 
such positions. At Dec. 31, 2013, our over-the-counter (ﬁOTCﬂ) 
derivative assets of $4.2 billion included a CVA 

deduction of $26 million. Our OTC derivative 

liabilities of $5.6 billion included a debit valuation 
adjustment (ﬁDVAﬂ) of $9 million related to our own 

credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased $29 

million and the DVA decreased $12 million in 2013.  

The net impact of these adjustments increased foreign 
exchange and other trading revenue by $17 million in 
2013. At Dec. 31, 2012, our OTC derivative assets of $5.1 billion included a CVA deduction of $103 million.  

Our OTC derivative liabilities of $7.0 billion included 
a DVA of $29 million related to our own credit 

spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased $80 

million and the DVA decreased $16 million in 2012.  

The net impact of these adjustments increased foreign 
exchange and other trading revenue by $64 million in 
2012. The table below summarizes the risk ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative 
counterparty credit exposure. This information 

indicates the degree of risk to which we are exposed. 
Significant changes in ratings classifications for our 
foreign exchange and other trading activity could 
result in increased risk for us. The changes year-

over-year were impacted by a decrease in aggregate 

exposure across the portfolio primarily impacting 
both the AAA to AA- and the BBB+ to BBB- 

categories. The decreases were largely driven by 

increases in swap rates over the year which caused 
certain exposures to decline in value.  66 BNY Mellon

Our diversified business activities include processing securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, 
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets, and 
other transactions. The market risks from these 

activities are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to 
movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage 

interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation 
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures. An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The model incorporates management™s assumptions 
regarding interest rates, balance changes on core deposits, market spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of 
derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. These assumptions have 
been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. As a result, the earnings 

simulation model cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or the impact of higher or lower 
interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results 

may differ from projected results due to timing, 

magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and 
changes in market conditions and management™s 

strategies, among other factors. These scenarios do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact as interest rate expectations change. The table below 

relies on certain critical assumptions regarding the 
balance sheet and depositors™ behavior related to 
interest rate fluctuations and the prepayment and extension risk in certain of our assets. To the extent 
that actual behavior is different from that assumed in 

the models, there could be a change in interest rate sensitivity. 
We evaluate the effect on earnings by running various 
interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. 
These scenarios are reviewed to examine the impact of large interest rate movements.  Interest rate 
sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month measurement period. The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for BNY Mellon: 
Estimated changes in net interest revenue (dollars in millions) Dec. 31, 2012 March 31, 2013 June 30, 2013 Sept. 30,2013 Dec. 31, 2013 up 200 bps parallel rate ramp vs. baseline (a) $ 607

BNY Mellon 67 
         (continued)The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes rates increase 25 basis points in each of the next four 
quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario 
assumes a 50 basis point per quarter increase. Our net interest revenue sensitivity table above incorporates assumptions about the impact of changes 
in interest rates on depositor behavior based on 
historical experience. Given the current historically 

low interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates 
could lead to higher depositor withdrawals than 
historically experienced. Growth or contraction of deposits could also be affected by the following factors: 
Ł Monetary policy; Ł Global economic uncertainty; Ł Our ratings relative to other financial institutions™ ratings; and Ł Money market mutual fund and other regulatory reform. Any of these events could change our assumptions about depositor behavior and have a significant 
impact on our balance sheet and net interest revenue. We also project future cash flows from our assets and 
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount 
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks 
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the 

structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by 
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of 

these discounted cash flows is the Economic Value of 

Equity (ﬁEVEﬂ). The following table shows how the 

EVE would change in response to changes in interest 
rates: Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31, 2013 Rate change: up 200 bps vs. baseline(4.2)% up 100 bps vs. baseline(2.0)% These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 
interest rate expectations change. The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact 
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may 
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates 
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory 

capital, even though economically there may be no 
impact on our economic capital position. For 

example, an increase in rates will result in a decline 
in the value of our available-for-sale securities 

portfolio, which will be reflected through a reduction 
in other comprehensive income in our shareholders™ 
equity thereby affecting our tangible common equity 

(ﬁTCEﬂ) ratios. Under current accounting rules, to 

the extent the fair value option provided in ASC 825 

is not applied, there is no corresponding change on 
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these 
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise. We project the impact of this change using the same 
interest rate shock assumptions described earlier and 
compare the projected mark-to-market on the 
investment securities portfolio at Dec. 31, 2013, 
under the higher rate environments versus a stable 
rate scenario. The table below shows the impact of a 

change in interest rates on the TCE ratio: 
Estimated changes in TCE ratio
Dec. 31, (in basis points) 2013 up 200 bps vs. baseline (83) up 100 bps vs. baseline (41) These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 
interest rate expectations change. To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign 
currency-denominated assets with liability 
instruments denominated in the same currency.  We 

utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability 
denominated in the same currency is not available or 
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of 
translation gains or losses created by investments in 
foreign markets. The foreign exchange risk related to 

the interest rate spread on foreign currency-
denominated asset/liability positions is managed as 
part of our trading activities. We use forward foreign 

exchange contracts to protect the value of our net 
investment in foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2013, 

net investments in foreign operations totaled $12 
billion and were spread across 13 foreign currencies.  68 BNY Mellon 
Risk management overview Governance 
Risk management and oversight begins with the Board of Directors and two key Board committees: 
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. 
The Risk Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and meets on a regular basis to 
review and assess the control processes with respect 
to the Company™s inherent risks.  They also review 

and assess the risk management activities of the 
Company and the Company™s fiduciary risk policies 

and activities. Policy formulation and day-to-day 

oversight of the Risk Management Framework is 
delegated to the Chief Risk Officer, who, together 

with the Chief Auditor and Chief Compliance Officer, 

helps ensure an effective risk management 

governance structure. The roles and responsibilities 

of the Risk Committee are described in more detail in 
its charter, a copy of which is available on our 

website, www.bnymellon.com
. The Audit Committee is also comprised entirely of 

independent directors, all of whom are financially 
literate within the meaning of the NYSE listing 
standards, and one of whom has been determined to 
be an audit committee financial expert as set out in 
the rules and regulations under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ﬁExchange 

Actﬂ), with accounting or related financial 
management expertise within the meaning of the 
NYSE listing standards. All members of the Audit 

Committee have been determined to have banking 
and financial management expertise within the 
meaning of the FDIC rules. The Audit Committee 

meets on a regular basis to perform an oversight 
review of the integrity of the financial statements and 
financial reporting process, compliance with legal 
and regulatory requirements, our independent 
registered public accountant™s qualifications and 

independence, and the performance of our registered 
public accountant and internal audit function. The 

Audit Committee also reviews management™s 

assessment of the adequacy of internal controls. The 

functions of the Audit Committee are described in 

more detail in its charter, a copy of which is available 

on our website, www.bnymellon.com
. The Senior Risk Management Committee (ﬁSRMCﬂ) 
is the most senior management body responsible for 
ensuring that emerging risks are weighed against the 
corporate risk appetite and that any material 
amendments to the risk appetite statement are 
properly vetted and recommended to the Executive 
Committee and the Board for approval. The SRMC 

also reviews any material breaches to our risk 
appetite and approves action plans required to 
remediate the issue. SRMC provides oversight for 

the risk management, compliance and ethics 
framework. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk 

Officer and Chief Financial Officer are among 

SRMC™s members. 
Risk appetite statement 
BNY Mellon defines risk appetite as the level of risk 
it is normally willing to accept while pursuing the 
interests of our major stakeholders, including our 
clients, shareholders, employees and regulators. The 

Company has adopted the following as its risk 
appetite statement: ﬁRisk taking is a fundamental 

characteristic of providing financial services and 
arises in every transaction we undertake. Our risk 

appetite is driven by the fact that our Company is the 
global leader in providing services that enable the 
management and servicing of financial assets in more 
than 100 markets worldwide and has been designated 
by international regulators as one of the 29 Global 
Systemically Important Financial Institutions (ﬁG-
SIFIsﬂ). This designation recognizes our fundamental 

importance to the health and operation of the global 
capital markets and carries with it a responsibility to 
maintain the highest standards of excellence. As a 

result, we are committed to maintaining a strong 
balance sheet throughout market cycles and to 
delivering operational excellence to meet the 
expectations of our major stakeholders, including our 
clients, shareholders, employees and regulators. The 

balance sheet will be characterized by strong 
liquidity, superior asset quality, ready access to 

external funding sources at competitive rates and a 
strong capital structure that supports our risk taking 
activities and is adequate to absorb potential losses. 
These characteristics support our goal of having 
superior debt ratings among our peers. To that end, 

the Company™s Risk Management Framework has 

been designed to: Ł ensure that appropriate risk tolerances (ﬁlimitsﬂ) 
are in place to govern our risk taking activities 
across all businesses and risk types; Ł ensure that our risk appetite principles permeate 
the Company™s culture and are incorporated into 

our strategic decision-making processes; BNY Mellon 69 
(continued)Ł ensure rigorous monitoring and reporting of key risk metrics to senior management and the Board 
of Directors; and Ł ensure that there is an on-going, and forward-
looking, capital planning process to support our 
risk taking activities.ﬂ Primary risk types The understanding, identification and management of risk are essential elements for the successful 
management of BNY Mellon.  Our primary risk 

categories are: Type of risk Description Operational/business The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, human factors and
systems, breaches of technology and
information systems, or from external events.
Also includes fiduciary risk, reputational risk,
and litigation risk. Market The risk of loss due to adverse changes in the
financial markets. Our market risks are 

primarily interest rate, foreign exchange, and
equity risk. Market risk particularly impacts
our exposures that are marked-to-market such
as the securities portfolio, trading book, and
equity investments. Credit The possible loss we would suffer if any of our 

borrowers or other counterparties were to
default on their obligations to us. Credit risk is
resident in the majority of our assets, but
primarily concentrated in the loan and
securities books, as well as off-balance-sheet 

exposures such as lending commitments,
letters of credit, and securities lending
indemnifications. Liquidity The risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash 

and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost
for both expected and unexpected cash flows,
without adversely affecting daily operations or 

financial conditions. Liquidity risk can arise

from cash flow mismatches, market constraints 
from inability to convert assets to cash,
inability to raise cash in the markets, deposit
run-off, or contingent liquidity events. Thus, 

liquidity risk can be inherent in the majority of
our balance sheet exposures. The following table presents the primary types of risk typically embedded in on- and off-balance-sheet 

instruments. Risks of our on- and off-balance-sheet instruments Assets: Interest-bearing deposits withbanks Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements Securities Trading assets

(continued) The following chart provides a guide to the primary risks inherent in our businesses. Liquidity risk is 

managed on a stand-alone basis at the Consolidated 
and Bank levels. Management of liquidity risk is the 

responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Group which 

is reported in the Other segment. The percentages 

below are based on the allocation of economic capital 
at Dec. 31, 2013 to protect against unexpected 
economic losses over a one-year period at a level 
consistent with the solvency of a target debt rating. 
Operational/business risk Overview 
In providing a comprehensive array of products and services, we may be exposed to operational/business 
risk. Operational/business risk may result from, but 

is not limited to, errors related to transaction 
processing, breaches of internal control systems and 
compliance requirements, fraud by employees or 
persons outside BNY Mellon or business interruption 

due to system failures or other events. Operational/ 

business risk may also include breaches of our 
technology and information systems resulting from 
unauthorized access to confidential information or 
from internal or external threats, such as cyber 
attacks. Operational/business risk also includes 

potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as 
a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and/or 
regulatory requirements. In the case of an operational 

event, we could suffer a financial loss as well as 

damage to our reputation. To address these risks, we maintain comprehensive 
policies and procedures and an internal control 
framework designed to provide a sound operational 
environment. These controls have been designed to 
manage operational/business risk at appropriate levels 
given our financial strength, the business 
environment and markets in which we operate, the 
nature of our businesses, and considering factors such 
as competition and regulation. Our internal auditors 

and internal control group monitor and test the overall 
effectiveness of our internal controls and financial 

reporting systems on an ongoing basis. We have also established procedures that are designed 
to ensure compliance with generally accepted 
conduct, ethics and business practices which are 
defined in our corporate policies. These include 

training programs such as for our ﬁCode of Conduct,ﬂ 
and ﬁKnow Your Customerﬂ programs, and 

compliance training programs such as those regarding 
information protection, suspicious activity reporting, 
and operational risk. Operational/business risk management 
We have established operational/business risk 
management as an independent risk discipline. The 

Operational Risk Management (ﬁORMﬂ) Group and 
Information Risk Management (ﬁIRMﬂ) Group report 
to the Chief Risk Officer.  The organizational 

framework for operational/business risk is based upon 
a strong risk culture that incorporates both 
governance and risk management activities 
comprising: Ł Board Oversight and Governance - The Risk 

Committee of the Board approves and oversees 
our operational/business risk management 
strategy in addition to credit and market risk. The 

Risk Committee meets regularly to review and 
approve operational/business risk management 
initiatives, discuss key risk issues, and review the 
effectiveness of the risk management systems. 
Ł Accountability of Businesses - Business 
managers are responsible for maintaining an 
effective system of internal controls 

commensurate with their risk profiles and in 
accordance with BNY Mellon policies and 

procedures. Ł ORM Group - The ORM Group is responsible for 

developing risk management policies and tools 
for assessing, measuring, monitoring and 
managing operational risk for BNY Mellon.  The 

primary objectives of the ORM group are to 
promote effective risk management, identify 

emerging risks, create incentives for generating 
BNY Mellon 71 
(continued)continuous improvement in controls, and to optimize capital. Ł IRM Group - The IRM Group is responsible for 

developing policies, methods and tools for 
identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring and 
governing information and technology risk for 
BNY Mellon.  The IRM Group partners with the 

businesses to help maintain and protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the 

firm™s information and technology assets from 

internal and external threats such as cyber 
attacks. Market risk In addition to the Risk Committee and SRMC, oversight of market risk is performed by certain 
committees and through executive review meetings. 
Detailed reviews of derivative trading positions and 
stress tests results are conducted during the Global 
Markets Weekly Risk Review.  Senior managers from 

Risk Management, Finance and Sales and Trading 

attend the review.  
Regarding the Treasury function, oversight is 
provided by the Treasury Risk Committee, bi-weekly 

Portfolio Management Group risk meetings, Business 
Risk meetings, and numerous portfolio reviews. Business Risk meetings for the Global Markets business also provide a forum for market risk 
oversight. The goal of Business Risk meetings, 

which are held at least quarterly, is to review key risk 

and control issues and related initiatives facing all 
lines of business including Global Markets. The 

following activities are also addressed during 
Business Risk meetings: Ł Reporting of all new Monitoring Limits and 
changes to existing limits; and Ł Monitoring of trading exposures, VaR, market 

sensitivities and stress testing results. The Derivatives Documentation Committee reviews 
and approves variations in the Company™s 

documentation standards as it relates to derivative 
transactions. In addition, this committee reviews all 

outstanding confirmations to identify potential 
exposure to the Company.  Finally, the Risk 

Quantification and Modeling Committee validates 
and reviews back-testing results for the Company™s 

VaR model. 
Credit risk To balance the value of our activities with the credit 
risk incurred in pursuing them, we set and monitor 
internal credit limits for activities that entail credit 
risk, most often on the size of the exposure and the 
maximum maturity of credit extended. For credit 

exposures driven by changing market rates and 
prices, exposure measures include an add-on for such 
potential changes. We manage credit risk at both the individual exposure 
level as well as the portfolio level.€Credit risk at the 

individual exposure level is managed through our 
credit approval system and involves four approval 
levels up to and including the Chief Risk Officer of 

the Company.€€The requisite approvals are based upon 

the size and relative risk of the aggregate exposure 
under consideration.€The Credit Risk Group is 

responsible for approving the size, terms and maturity 
of all credit exposures as well as the ongoing 
monitoring of the creditworthiness of the 
counterparty.€ In addition, they are responsible for 

assigning and maintaining the risk ratings on each 
exposure. Credit risk management at the portfolio level is supported by the Basel & Capital Adequacy Group, 

within the Risk Management and Compliance Sector.  

The Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is responsible 

for calculating two fundamental credit measures. 
First, we project a statistically probable credit loss, 
used to help determine the appropriate loan loss 
reserve and to measure customer profitability.  Credit 

loss considers three basic components: the estimated 

size of the exposure whenever default might occur, 

the probability of default before maturity and the 
severity of the loss we would incur, commonly called 

ﬁloss given default.ﬂ For institutional lending, where 

most of our credit risk is created, unfunded 
commitments are assigned a usage given default 
percentage. Borrowers/Counterparties are assigned 

ratings by Credit Portfolio Managers (ﬁCPMsﬂ) and 
the Chief Credit Officer (ﬁCCOﬂ) on an 18-grade 

scale, which translate to a scaled probability of 
default. Additionally, transactions are assigned loss-

given-default ratings (on a 7-grade scale) that reflect 
the transactions™ structures including the effects of 

guarantees, collateral, and relative seniority of 
position. The second fundamental measurement of credit risk calculated by the Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is 
 72 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) called economic capital. Our economic capital model 
estimates the capital required to support the overall 
credit risk portfolio. Using a Monte Carlo simulation 

engine and measures of correlation among borrower 
defaults, the economic model examines extreme and 
highly unlikely scenarios of portfolio credit loss in 
order to estimate credit-related capital, and then 
allocates that capital to individual borrowers and 
exposures. The credit-related capital calculation 

supports a second tier of policy standards and limits 
by serving as an input to both profitability analysis 
and concentration limits of capital at risk with any 
one borrower, industry or country. 
The Basel & Capital Adequacy Group is responsible 
for the calculation methodologies and the estimates of 
the inputs used in those methodologies for the 
determination of expected loss and economic capital. 
These methodologies and input estimates are 
regularly evaluated to ensure their appropriateness 
and accuracy.  As new techniques and data become 

available, Basel & Capital Adequacy attempts to 

incorporate, where appropriate, those techniques or 
data. Credit risk is intrinsic to much of the banking business. However, BNY Mellon seeks to limit both 

on- and off-balance sheet credit risk through prudent 

underwriting and the use of capital only where risk-
adjusted returns warrant. We seek to manage risk and 

improve our portfolio diversification through 
syndications, asset sales, credit enhancements, credit 
derivatives, and active collateralization and netting 
agreements. In addition, we have a separate Credit 

Risk Review Group, which is part of Internal Audit, 

made up of experienced loan review officers who 

perform timely reviews of the loan files and credit 
ratings assigned to the loans. Liquidity risk 
Our overall approach to liquidity management is to ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 

amount and diversity such that changes in funding 
requirements at the Parent and at the various bank 

subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without 
material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 
or our financial condition. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for the liquidity risk of the Company and approves the 
liquidity risk tolerances. The Asset Liability 

Committee (ﬁALCOﬂ) is the senior management committee responsible for the oversight of liquidity 
management. ALCO is responsible to ensure that 

Board approved strategies, policies, and procedures 
for managing liquidity are appropriately executed. 
Senior management is also responsible for regularly 
reporting the liquidity position of the Company to the 
Board of Directors. The Treasury Risk Committee is 

responsible for reviewing liquidity stress tests and 
various liquidity metrics including contractual cash 
flow gaps for liquidity, liquidity stress metrics and 

ratios, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding 
Ratio and client deposit concentration. The Treasury 

Risk Committee approves and validates stress test 
methodologies and assumptions. BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments 
and seeks to diversify funding sources by line of 
business, customer and market segment. 
Additionally, we seek to maintain liquidity ratios 

within approved limits and liquidity risk tolerance, 
maintain a liquid asset buffer that can be liquidated, 

financed and/or pledged as necessary, and control the 

levels and sources of wholesale funds. Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of customer deposits and client drawdowns on unfunded 
credit or liquidity facilities. We actively monitor 

unfunded lending-related commitments, thereby 
reducing unanticipated funding requirements. When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics to ensure ample liquidity for expected and 
unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 

mismatches, asset maturities, debt spreads, peer 
ratios, liquid assets, unencumbered collateral, funding 
sources and balance sheet liquidity ratios. We 

monitor the revised Basel III liquidity coverage ratio 
and continue to evaluate the U.S. banking agencies™ 
proposal for the Basel III LCR. Internal ratios we 

currently monitor as part of our standard analysis 
include total loans as a percentage of total deposits, 
deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning 
assets, foreign deposits as a percentage of total 
interest-earnings assets, purchased funds as a 
percentage of total interest-earning assets, liquid 
assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, 
liquid assets as a percentage of purchased funds, and 
discount window collateral and central bank deposits 
as a percentage of total deposits. All of these internal 

ratios exceeded our minimum guidelines at Dec. 31, 

2013. BNY Mellon 73 
(continued)We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 

under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are based 

on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under 
unlikely but plausible events. The Company 

performs these tests under various time horizons 
ranging from one day to one year in a base case, as 
well as supplemental tests to determine whether the 
Company™s liquidity is sufficient for severe market 

events and firm-specific events. Under our scenario 

testing program, the results of the tests indicate that 
the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
Stress Testing 

It is the policy of the Company to perform Enterprise-wide Stress Testing at regular intervals as part of its 

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 

(ﬁICAAPﬂ). Additionally, the Company performs an 

analysis of capital adequacy in a stressed 
environment in its Enterprise-Wide Stress Test 

Framework, as required by the enhanced prudential 
standards issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing performs analysis 
across the Company™s Lines of Business, products, 

geographic areas, and risk types incorporating the 
results from the different underlying models and 

projections given a certain stress-test scenario. It is 

an important component of assessing the adequacy of 
capital (as in the ICAAP) as well as identifying any 
high risk touch points in business activities. 
Furthermore, by integrating enterprise-wide stress 
testing into the Company™s capital planning process, 

the results provide a forward-looking evaluation of 
the ability to complete planned capital actions in a 
more-adverse-than-anticipated economic 
environment. Economic capital required 
BNY Mellon has implemented a methodology to 
quantify economic capital. We define economic 

capital as the capital required to protect against 
unexpected economic losses over a one-year period at 
a level consistent with the solvency of a target debt 

rating. We quantify economic capital requirements 

for the risks inherent in our business activities using 
statistical modeling techniques and then aggregate 
them at the consolidated level. A capital reduction, or 

diversification benefit, is applied to reflect the 
unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss 

in each type of risk at the same time. Economic 
capital requirements are directly related to our risk 
profile. As such, it has become a part of our internal 

capital adequacy assessment process and, along with 
regulatory capital, are a key component to ensuring 
that the actual level of capital is commensurate with 
our risk profile and sufficient to provide the financial 

flexibility to undertake future strategic business 
initiatives. The framework and methodologies to quantify each of our risk types have been developed by the Basel & 
Capital Adequacy Group and are designed to be 

consistent with our risk management principles. The 

framework has been approved by senior management 
and has been reviewed by the Risk Committee of the 
Board of Directors. Due to the evolving nature of 

quantification techniques, we expect to continue to 
refine the methodologies used to estimate our 
economic capital requirements. The following table presents our economic capital required at Dec. 31, 2013, on a consolidated basis. Economic capital required at Dec. 31, 2013 (in millions) Credit $ 2,875 
Market 1,968 Operational 3,492 Other (26) Economic capital required - consolidated $ 8,309 
Basel I Tier 1 common equity $ 16,443 
Capital cushion $ 8,134 
Global compliance Our global compliance function provides leadership, guidance, and oversight to help our businesses 
identify applicable laws and regulations and 
implement effective measures to meet the specific 

requirements. Compliance takes a proactive 

approach by anticipating evolving regulatory 
standards and remaining aware of industry best 
practices, legislative initiatives, competitive issues, 
and public expectations and perceptions. The 

function uses its global reach to disseminate 
information about compliance-related matters 
throughout BNY Mellon.  The Chief Compliance and 

Ethics Officer reports to the Chief Risk Officer, is a 

member of key committees of BNY Mellon and 

provides regular updates to the Risk Committee of the 
Board of Directors.  74 BNY Mellon 
(continued) Internal audit Internal Audit is an independent, objective assurance 
function that reports directly to the Audit Committee 

of the Company™s Board of Directors.  It assists the 

Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing 
a systematic, disciplined, risk-based approach to 
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the 

Company™s risk management, control, and 

governance processes. The scope of Internal Audit™s 

work includes the review and evaluation of the 
adequacy, effectiveness, and sustainability of risk 

management procedures, internal control systems, 
information systems and governance processes. BNY Mellon 75 
 Evolving Regulatory Environment BNY Mellon, together with its subsidiaries, engages 
in banking, investment advisory and other financial 
activities in the U.S. and 35 other countries, and is 
subject to extensive regulation. Global supervisory 

authorities generally are charged with ensuring the 

safety and soundness of financial institutions, 
protecting the interests of customers, including 
depositors in banking entities and investors in mutual 
funds and other pooled vehicles, and safeguarding the 
integrity of securities and other financial markets and 
promoting systemic resiliency and financial stability 
in the relevant country.  They are not, however, 

generally charged with protecting the interests of our 

stockholders or non-deposit creditors. This 

discussion outlines the material elements of selected 
laws and regulations applicable to us. Changes in 

these standards, or in their application, cannot be 
predicted, but may have a material effect on our 

businesses and results of operations. The financial services industry has been the subject of enhanced regulatory scrutiny in recent years globally, 

and we expect this trend to continue in the future. 
Our business has been subject to myriad new global 
reform measures. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

(the ﬁDodd-Frank Actﬂ), when fully implemented, 

will significantly restructure the financial regulatory 
regime in the United States and enhance supervision 
and prudential standards for bank holding companies 
(ﬁBHCsﬂ) like BNY Mellon.  The implications of the 

Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses will depend to a 

large extent on the manner in which forthcoming 

rules are implemented by the primary U.S. financial 
regulatory agencies - the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, 
the OCC, the SEC and the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (the ﬁCFTCﬂ).  The 

implications will also depend upon changes in market 
practices and structures in response to the 
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial 

reforms in other jurisdictions. Many aspects of the 

Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to further 

rulemaking, take effect over various transition 

periods, or contain other elements that make it 
difficult to precisely anticipate their final impact.  The 

Dodd-Frank Act contains many major domestic 

reforms that will eventually apply to BNY Mellon 

and that will affect its businesses and those of its 

clients not only domestically but also internationally.  

In addition, other national and global reform 
measures that are being considered or have been adopted by various policy makers (including the U.S. 
implementation of the Basel III capital and liquidity 
framework) may materially impact us. Relevant 

regulatory initiatives, whether national or global, are 
discussed further below.  
Enhanced Prudential Standards 
Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act direct 
the Federal Reserve to enact heightened prudential 
standards applicable to BHCs with total consolidated 
assets of $50 billion or more, such as BNY Mellon, 

and certain designated nonbank financial companies 
(generally referred to as ﬁsystemically important 
financial institutionsﬂ or ﬁSIFIsﬂ). Dodd-Frank 

mandates that the requirements applicable to SIFIs be 
more stringent than those applicable to other financial 
companies. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve 

issued for public comment a notice of proposed 
rulemaking, which we refer to as the ﬁProposed SIFI 
Rules,ﬂ establishing enhanced prudential standards 
for: Ł risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits; Ł liquidity requirements;Ł single-counterparty credit exposure limits;Ł stress testing of capital;Ł overall risk management requirements; and
Ł remedial actions that SIFIs must take during the early stages of financial distress if specified 
trigger events occur (referred to as the ﬁearly 
remediation provisionsﬂ). The rules addressing stress testing of capital were 
finalized and effective commencing with the third 

quarter of 2013. In February 2014, the Federal 

Reserve adopted rules (ﬁFinal SIFI Rulesﬂ) to 
implement the liquidity and risk management 
requirements of the Proposed SIFI Rules. Beginning 

Jan. 1, 2015, the rules require BHCs with $50 billion 
or more in total consolidated assets to comply with 
enhanced liquidity and overall risk management 
standards, including a buffer of highly liquid assets 

based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and 
increased involvement by boards of directors in 
liquidity and overall risk management. The liquidity 

buffer is in addition to the U.S. banking agencies™ 

proposal on minimum liquidity standards discussed 
below and described by the Federal Reserve as being 
ﬁcomplementaryﬂ to those liquidity standards. The 

Federal Reserve has not yet adopted final rules 
addressing the Proposed SIFI Rules™
 76 BNY Mellon 
(continued) counterparty credit limits or early remediation provisions. counterparty credit limits, short-term debt limits, or 
early remediation provisions.€The Federal Reserve 

noted that it is still developing the single-counterparty 
credit limit rule, taking into account the Basel 
Committee™s large exposure limits. 
Similar to the single-counterparty credit limits in the Proposed SIFI Rules, the Basel Committee released a 
Consultative Document in March 2013 outlining a 
supervisory framework for measuring and controlling 
large exposures. The framework is conceptually 

analogous to the single-counterparty exposure limits 
in the proposed SIFI rules; however, it differs from 

the U.S. proposal in multiple ways, including 
exposure measurement methodologies and the base 
denominator for calculating credit exposure limits. The Basel™s Committee™s large exposures proposal 
includes specific proposals for the treatment of 
securities finance transactions, including securities 
lending transactions. As proposed, the framework 

eschews credit exposure measurement methodologies 
for securities finance transactions that firms have 
developed to comply with previous risk-based capital 
rules. Instead, the proposal includes a risk-insensitive 
measurement methodology that relies on static 
collateral haircuts. Capital Planning and Stress Testing 

Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other 
Capital Distributions The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries. 
Dividends and interest from its subsidiaries are the 
Parent™s principal sources of funds to make capital 

contributions or loans to its subsidiaries, to service its 
own debt, to honor its guarantees of debt issued by its 
subsidiaries or of trust preferred securities issued by a 
trust or to make its own capital distributions. Various 

federal and state statutes and regulations limit the 
amount of dividends that may be paid to the Parent by 
our bank subsidiaries without regulatory consent. If, 

in the opinion of the applicable federal regulatory 
agency, a depository institution under its jurisdiction 

is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or 
unsound practice (which, depending on the financial 
condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the regulator may require, after notice and 
hearing, that the bank cease and desist from such 
practice. The OCC, the Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC have indicated that the payment of dividends 
would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if 
the payment would reduce a depository institution™s 

capital to an inadequate level. Moreover, under the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the ﬁFDI 

Actﬂ), an insured depository institution may not pay 
any dividends if the institution is undercapitalized or 
if the payment of the dividend would cause the 
institution to become undercapitalized. In addition, 

the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued 
policy statements which provide that FDIC-insured 
depository institutions and their holding companies 
should generally pay dividends only out of their 
current operating earnings. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, 

N.A., The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 

National Association and BNY Mellon Trust 

Company of Delaware is limited to the lesser of the 
amounts calculated under a ﬁrecent earningsﬂ test and 
an ﬁundivided profitsﬂ test. Under the recent earnings 

test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all 
dividends declared and paid by the entity in any 
calendar year exceeds the current year™s net income 

combined with the retained net income of the two 
preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior 
regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, 

a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity™s 

ﬁundivided profitsﬂ (generally, accumulated net 

profits that have not been paid out as dividends or 
transferred to surplus). The ability of its bank 

subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent may also 
be affected by various minimum capital requirements 

for banking organizations.  
BNY Mellon™s capital distributions are subject to 
Federal Reserve oversight. The major component of 

that oversight is the Federal Reserve™s CCAR, 

implementing its capital plan rules. These rules 

require BHCs having $50 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets (including BNY Mellon) to 

submit annual capital plans to their respective Federal 
Reserve Bank. We are also required to collect and 

report certain related data on a quarterly basis to 
allow the Federal Reserve to monitor progress against 
the annual capital plans. BNY Mellon and other 

affected BHCs may pay dividends, repurchase stock, 

and make other capital distributions only in 
accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed BNY Mellon 77 
 (continued)by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The Federal Reserve may 

object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that 
the covered BHC will meet, for each quarter 
throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered 
by the capital plan, all minimum regulatory capital 
ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for 

that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital 
ratios and maintain a Tier 1 common to risk-weighted 

assets ratio of at least 5% calculated under existing 
general risk-based capital rules as currently in effect, 

in each case on a pro forma
 basis under the base case and stressful scenarios (including a severely adverse 
scenario provided by the Federal Reserve). The 

capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered BHC 
may not make a capital distribution unless after 
giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a Tier 

1 common to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 5%. The purpose of CCAR is to ensure that these BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning 
processes that account for their unique risks and that 
permit continued operations during times of 
economic and financial stress. The CCAR rule, 

consistent with prior Federal Reserve Board 
guidance, provides that capital plans contemplating 
dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of projected 
after-tax net income will receive particularly close 

scrutiny.  BNY Mellon™s common stock dividend 

payout ratio was 33% in 2013, or 26% after adjusting 
for the net impact of the U.S. Tax Court™s decisions 

regarding certain foreign tax credits. We submitted our 2014 capital plan to the Federal 
Reserve on Jan. 6, 2014. The Federal Reserve has 

indicated that it expects to publish either its objection 
or non-objection to the capital plan and proposed 
capital actions, such as dividend payments and share 
repurchases, on March 26, 2014. We anticipate 

announcing our 2014 capital plan shortly thereafter. 
Regulatory Stress-Testing Requirements 

In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements, Federal Reserve regulations also include the new 
Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (ﬁDFASTﬂ), which were 

adopted in final form in October 2012. The CCAR 

and Dodd-Frank stress testing requirements 
substantially overlap, and the Federal Reserve 
implements them at the BHC level on a coordinated 
basis. Under these DFAST regulations, we are required to 

undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the 

Federal Reserve annually, and to conduct our own 

internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory 
requirements twice annually.  In addition, The Bank 

of New York Mellon is required to conduct its own 

annual internal stress test (although this bank is 
permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure 
of its stress test results with the results of BNY 
Mellon). These requirements, which began in the 

fourth quarter of 2012, involve both company-run and 
supervisory-run testing of capital under various 
scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely 
adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate 
banking regulator.  Results from our annual company-

run stress tests are reported to the appropriate 
regulators and published. We published the results of 

our company-run stress test on March 14, 2013, and 
the results of our company-run mid-year stress test on 
Sept. 16, 2013. Capital Requirements - Existing U.S. Requirements As a BHC, we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital rules administered by the Federal Reserve. 
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital 
requirements administered by the Federal Reserve in 
the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the 

OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, 
BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York 

Mellon Trust Company, National Association.  These 

requirements are intended to ensure that banking 
organizations have adequate capital given the risk 

levels of their assets and off-balance sheet financial 

instruments. The U.S. banking agencies™ capital rules have been 
based on three main components: Ł Risk-based capital rules applicable to all banking organizations based on the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision™s 1988 agreement, 

International Convergence of Capital and 

Measurement Standards
 (ﬁBasel Iﬂ). The banking 

agencies refer to these rules as the ﬁgeneral risk-
based capital rulesﬂ. Ł Risk-based capital rules applicable to banking organizations having $250 billion or more in total 

consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in 
foreign exposures (including BNY Mellon), 

based upon the advanced internal ratings-based 
approach for credit risk and the advanced  78 BNY Mellon 
   (continued) measurement approach for operational risk within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision™s 

comprehensive June 2006 release, International Convergence of Capital Measurement and 

Capital Standards: A Revised Framework
 (ﬁBasel IIﬂ). The agencies refer to these rules as the 

ﬁAdvanced Approachesﬂ risk-based capital rules. 
Ł A Tier 1 leverage ratio that measures Tier 1 
capital to total assets. In addition, the risk-based capital rules incorporate a 
measure for market risk in foreign exchange and 
commodity activities and in the trading of debt and 
equity instruments. The market risk-based capital 

rules require banking organizations with significant 

trading activities to maintain capital for market risk in 
an amount calculated by using the banking 
organizations™ own internal value-at-risk models, 

subject to parameters set by the regulators. Effective 

Jan. 1, 2013, the U.S. banking agencies made 
substantial amendments to their market risk rules 
implementing revisions, commonly known as ﬁBasel 
II.5ﬂ, that the Basel Committee had made to the Basel 
framework™s market risk provisions.  
General Risk-Based Capital Rules 
Under the agencies™ general risk-based capital rules 
based on Basel I, the risk-based capital ratio is 
determined by dividing the sum of the capital 
components (Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) by risk-

weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet 

items, such as standby letters of credit). The required 

minimum ratio of total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and 

Tier 2 capital) to risk-adjusted assets is 8.0%.  The 

required minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-

adjusted assets is 4.0%. The general risk-based capital rules provide that voting common stockholders™ equity should be the 

predominant element within Tier 1 capital and that 

banks should avoid over-reliance on non-common 

equity elements. Risk-adjusted assets are determined 

by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet 

items into weighted categories. These rules are 

minimum standards based primarily on broad credit-
risk considerations and do not take into account the 
other types of risk to which a banking organization 

may be exposed. The federal banking agencies retain 

significant discretion to set higher capital 
requirements for categories of banks or for an 
individual bank as situations warrant. At Dec. 31, 
assets and Total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios 

were 16.2% and 17.0%, respectively.  
Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rules 

The U.S. banking agencies™Advanced Approaches 
risk-based capital rules are based on Basel II™s 

Advanced Approaches.  On Feb. 21, 2014, the 

Federal Reserve announced that BNY Mellon had 

been approved to exit parallel run reporting for U.S. 
regulatory capital purposes, and will transition from 
the general risk-based capital rules to the Final 
Capital Rules™Advanced Approaches, effective 

starting in the second quarter of 2014, subject to 
ongoing qualification. We will be required to comply 

with advanced approaches reporting and public 
disclosures commencing on June 30, 2014. This 

means, among other things, for purposes of 
determining whether we meet minimum risk-based 
capital requirements, starting with the second quarter 
of 2014 our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 

capital ratio, and total capital ratio will be the lower 
of that calculated under the general risk-based capital 
rules (during 2014 these ratios are determined using a 
Basel III numerator and Basel I risk-weightings) and 
under the Advanced Approaches rule. 
Capital Requirements -Basel III Final Capital Rules and Proposals 
In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies approved the Final Capital Rules. The Final Capital Rules are 

largely based on the Basel Committee™s December 

2010 final capital framework for strengthening 
international capital standards, now officially 

identified by the Basel Committee as ﬁBasel IIIﬂ, and 
also implement, through the new ﬁStandardized 
Approachﬂ discussed below, a revised calculation of 

risk-weighted assets that, effective Jan. 1, 2015, will 

replace the calculation of risk-weighted assets under 
the existing general risk-based capital rules. The 

Final Capital Rules: Ł Redefine the components of capital in the numerator of regulatory capital ratios in a more narrow way than existing standards; Ł Increase the minimum risk-based capital ratios under the general risk-based capital rules and the 
Advanced Approaches; 
Ł Change the measure of risk-weighted assets in the denominator of the general risk-based capital 
rules according to the ﬁStandardized Approach,ﬂ 
2013, BNY Mellon™s Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted 
BNY Mellon 79 
  (continued)so that the Standardized Approach is the new 
ﬁgeneral risk-based capitalﬂ standard; Ł Change the measure of risk-weighted assets in the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios in the 
agencies™Advanced Approaches rules; 
Ł Establishes a capital conservation buffer; 
Ł Introduces a countercyclical capital buffer for 
advanced approaches banking organizations; and 
Ł Establishes a supplementary leverage ratio for advanced approaches banking organizations. 
The Final Capital Rules allow a graduated 
implementation schedule that began on Jan. 1, 2014 
for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, 

including BNY Mellon and will be substantially 

phased-in by 2019. The applicable transition periods 

for the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios, 
definitions of regulatory capital, and regulatory 
capital adjustments and deductions also began on Jan. 
1, 2014. In addition, BNY Mellon must begin using 

the new Standardized Approach risk-weightings on 

Jan. 1, 2015 (during 2014 Basel III looks to Basel I™s 

risk-weightings in lieu of its Standardized Approach); 

meet the minimum ratios for the capital conservation 
buffer and countercyclical capital buffer during the 

transition period beginning on Jan. 1, 2016; and begin 
compliance with the new Basel III-based 
supplementary leverage ratio on Jan. 1, 2018. The Final Capital Rules do not address certain matters concerning financial institution capital, 
liquidity and related matters expected to be the 
subject of regulation in the near term. These items 

include U.S. implementation of capital surcharges for 

global systemically important banks (ﬁG-SIBsﬂ) (for 
which BNY Mellon was originally provisionally 

assigned a 1.5% surcharge, but which has been 

reduced to 1.0% at the international level), Basel III™s 

liquidity standards, loss absorbency standards 
designed to facilitate a holding company ﬁsingle point 
of entryﬂ resolution under Title II of the Dodd-Frank 

Act, and capital charges designed to discourage 

overreliance on short-term wholesale funding 
practices. New Minimum Capital Ratios and Capital Buffers 
Consistent with the terms of the Basel III Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act, the Final Capital Rules  

require Advanced Approaches banking institutions to 

satisfy three minimum risk-based capital ratios using 
both the new Standardized Approach risk-weightings 

on Jan. 1, 2015 (during 2014 Basel III looks to Basel I™s risk weightings in lieu of the Standardized 

Approach) and the Advanced Approach (for BNY 

Mellon, commencing with the second quarter of 
2014): Ł a common equity Tier 1 (ﬁCET1ﬂ) ratio of 4.0% 
as of Jan. 1, 2014, increasing to 4.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2015; Ł a Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.5% on Jan. 1, 2014, 
increasing to 6.0% beginning Jan. 1, 2015; and Ł a total capital ratio of 8.0% (unchanged from the existing general risk-based capital rules). In addition, these minimum ratios will be 
supplemented by a new capital conservation buffer 

that phases in, beginning on Jan. 1, 2016, in 
increments of 0.625% per year until it reaches 2.5% 
on Jan. 1, 2019. BNY Mellon expects the 2.5% 

capital conservation buffer, as applied to it, to 

increase by an assumed additional G-SIB buffer 

applicable to BNY Mellon of 1%, noted above. 
The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb 
losses during periods of economic stress and applies 
to all banking organizations.  Banking organizations 

with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-

weighted assets above the minimum but below the 
conservation buffer (or below the combined capital 

conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, 

when the latter is applied) are expected to face 
constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and 
compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. During periods of excessive growth the capital conservation buffer may be expanded up to an 

additional 2.5% through the imposition of a 
countercyclical capital buffer.  The countercyclical 

capital buffer, when applicable, applies only to 

advanced approaches banking organizations.  The 

countercyclical capital buffer is initially set to zero, 

but it could increase if the banking agencies 
determine that there is excessive credit in the markets 
that could lead to wide-spread market failure. At Dec. 31, 2013, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.3% under the Advanced 

Approaches and 10.6% under the Standardized 
Approach, both on a fully phased-in basis based on 
our understanding of the Final Capital Rules and the 
final market risk rules.  80 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) New Measure of Capital 
The Final Capital Rules, like Basel III, provide for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to 
common equity Tier 1 capital.  These include, for 

example, providing that unrealized gains and losses 
on all available for sale debt securities may not be filtered out for regulatory capital purposes, and the 
requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred 
tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and 
significant investments in non-consolidated financial 
entities be deducted from Tier 1 common equity to 

the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of 
common equity Tier 1 or all such categories in the 

aggregate exceed 15% of common equity Tier 1. 
The Final Capital Rules redefine regulatory capital elements resulting in, among other things, cumulative 
perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred 
instruments no longer qualifying as Tier 1 capital, 

subject to a phase-out schedule. Non-qualifying 

capital instruments, such as trust preferred securities, 
that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 

capital prior to May 19, 2010 (and that are also 
outstanding on the effective date of the final rule) 

may continue to be included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital 

up to the following percentages: calendar year 2014:€

50%; calendar year 2015:€25%; and calendar year 

2016 and later dates:€0%. Certain non-qualifying 

instruments no longer eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 

capital may still be included in Tier 2 capital over a 

gradual phase-out schedule terminating in 2022. At 

Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon had $330 million of 

outstanding trust preferred securities. New General Risk-Based Capital Rules: Standardized Approach 
The Final Capital Rules amend the agencies™ general 
risk-based capital rules, replacing the risk-weight 
categories used to calculate risk-weighted assets in 
the denominator of capital ratios with a broader array 
of risk weighting categories that are intended to be 
more risk sensitive, known as the ﬁStandardized 
Approach.ﬂ The new risk-weights for the 

Standardized Approach range from 0% to 1,250% 

compared with the risk-weights of 0% to 100%, in 
general, in the Basel€I risk-based capital rules. 
Higher risk-weights would apply to a variety of 
exposures, including certain securitization exposures, 
equity exposures, claims on securities firms and 
exposures to counterparties on over-the-counter 

derivatives. Compared with Basel I, the risk-
weighting changes likely to have significance for 
BNY Mellon are the application of the collateral 

haircut approach to securities lending, the 
replacement of the 20% risk-weight for banks with 
OECD country risk classification ratings, the 
increased risk-weights for securitizations, the removal 
of the 50% risk-weight cap on derivative transactions, 
application of 1,250% risk-weight to default fund 
contribution and the elimination of the 0% risk-
weight for commitments of less than one year.  
Concerning securities finance transactions, including transactions in which we serve as agent and provide 
securities replacement indemnification to a securities 
lender, the Final Capital Rules do not permit a 

banking organization to use a simple VaR approach to 

calculate exposure amounts for repo-style 
transactions or to use internal models to calculate the 
exposure amount for the counterparty credit exposure 
for repo-style transactions under the Standardized 
Approach (although these methodologies are included 
in the Advanced Approaches).  Under the 

Standardized Approach, a banking organization may 

use a collateral haircut approach to recognize the 
credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral 
that secures a repo-style transaction, including an 
agented securities lending transaction, among other 
transactions.€To apply the collateral haircut approach, 

a banking organization must determine the exposure 

amount and the relevant risk weight for the 
counterparty or guarantor.€ Banking organizations 

may calculate market price volatility and foreign 
exchange volatility using their own internal estimates 
with prior written approval of their primary Federal 
supervisor. 
Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios 

As noted above, the U.S. banking agencies historically have required banks to meet a minimum 
Tier 1 leverage ratio.  The Final Capital Rules retain 

this Tier 1 leverage ratio but now require a minimum 

4% ratio for all banking organizations (eliminating 

the existing exception for certain banking 
organization to maintain only a 3% minimum).€ On 

Dec. 31, 2013, the Tier 1 leverage ratio for The Bank 

of New York Mellon Corporation was 5.4% and our 

primary banking subsidiary, The Bank of New York 

Mellon, was 5.3%. The Final Capital Rules also implement a new 3% Basel III-based supplementary leverage ratio for 
Advanced Approaches banking organizations, 
BNY Mellon 81 
  (continued)including BNY Mellon, to become effective Jan.€1, 
2018. Unlike the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the 

supplementary leverage ratio includes certain off-

balance sheet exposures in the denominator, including 

the potential future credit exposure of derivative 
contracts and 10% of the notional amount of 
unconditionally cancellable commitments. Subsequent to the U.S. banking agencies™ adoption of 
the Final Capital Rules: Ł The Basel Committee finalized (in Jan. 2014) modifications to the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio. Those modifications would adjust 

the supplementary leverage ratio™s denominator 

(referred to as the ﬁexposure amountﬂ) by making 
changes to the calculation of the exposure amount 
attributable to certain derivatives exposures and 
certain securities financing transactions but 
would retain the minimum Tier 1 supplementary 

leverage ratio requirement of 3%. Ł The U.S. banking agencies proposed to increase the minimum supplementary leverage ratio 
requirement for the largest U.S. banks (those 

deemed to be G-SIBs). The agencies™ proposal 

would require BNY Mellon and other bank 

holding companies that are G-SIBs to maintain a 
5% supplementary Tier 1 leverage ratio 

(comprised of the current minimum requirement 
of 3% plus a 2% buffer) and require bank 

subsidiaries of those bank holding companies, in 
order to qualify as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under the 
prompt corrective action regulations discussed 
below, to maintain a 6% supplementary Tier 1 

leverage ratio. The agencies have not yet acted 

upon these proposals. Prompt Corrective Action 
The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 

(ﬁFDICIAﬂ), requires the federal banking agencies to 
take ﬁprompt corrective actionﬂ in respect of 
depository institutions that do not meet specified 
capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital 

categories for FDIC-insured banks: ﬁwell 
capitalized,ﬂ ﬁadequately capitalized,ﬂ 
ﬁundercapitalized,ﬂ ﬁsignificantly undercapitalized,ﬂ 
and ﬁcritically undercapitalized.ﬂ The FDI Act 

imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on 
operations, management and capital distributions the 
less capital the institution holds. A depository institution is deemed to be ﬁwell 

capitalizedﬂ if the depository institution has a total 
risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%; Tier 1 risk-

based capital ratio of at least 6.0%; and Tier 1 

leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. FDICIA™s prompt 

corrective action provisions only apply to depository 
institutions and not to BHCs. The Federal Reserve™s 

regulations applicable to BHCs do include a concept 
of a ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ BHC, defined as one 
maintaining a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 
10.0% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 

6.0% (but not a leverage measure). A bank holding 

company that is not well capitalized under that 
definition (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well 
capitalized and well managed under applicable 
prompt corrective action standards) may not become 
a financial holding company and, if it is a financial 
holding company but then falls out of well-
capitalized status, may be restricted in certain of its 
activities and ultimately may lose financial holding 
company status. The Final Capital Rules establish revised ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ thresholds for insured depository 
institutions under the federal banking agencies™ 
prompt corrective action framework. Under the Final 

Capital Rules, an insured depository institution is 
deemed to be ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ if it has: Ł a Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 6.5%; 
Ł a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%; 
Ł a total capital ratio of at least 10%; and Ł a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. 
Effective January 2018, the Final Capital Rules also 
require an Advanced Approaches institution to 

maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 
3% to qualify for the ﬁadequately capitalizedﬂ status 
but does not have a minimum supplementary leverage 
ratio requirement to meet ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ status. 
However, as noted above, the U.S. banking agencies 

proposed revisions to the supplementary leverage 
ratio that would establish a supplementary leverage 
ratio ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ threshold of 6% for covered 
insured depository institutions, including The Bank of 

New York Mellon. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon and all of its bank 
subsidiaries were ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ based on the 
ratios and rules applicable to them noted above. A 

bank™s capital category, however, is determined solely 

for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective 
action rules and may not be an accurate  82 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) representation of the bank™s overall financial 
condition or prospects. Liquidity Standards - Basel III and U.S. Proposals Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and 
BHC liquidity principally have been addressed as a 
supervisory matter, both in the U.S. and 

internationally, without required formulaic measures.  

The Basel III framework requires banks and BHCs to 
measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests 
that, although similar in some respects to liquidity 
measures historically applied by banks and regulators 
for management and supervisory purposes, will be 
required by regulation. One test, referred to as the 

liquidity coverage ratio (ﬁLCRﬂ), is designed to 
ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate 
level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets 
equal to the entity™s expected net cash outflow for a 

30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress 
scenario. The other, referred to as the net stable 

funding ratio (ﬁNSFRﬂ), is designed to promote more 
medium- and long-term funding of the assets and 
activities of banking entities over a one-year time 
horizon. The Basel Committee issued the final LCR 

document in January 2013 and proposed revisions to 
the NSFR in January 2014. The Basel III liquidity 

framework, as modified in January 2013, 
contemplates that the LCR will be introduced Jan. 1, 
2015 with the minimum requirement beginning at 
60%, rising in equal annual steps of 10 percentage 
points to reach 100% on Jan. 1, 2019. Similarly, it 

contemplates that the NSFR will be subject to an 
observation period through mid-2016 and, subject to 
any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted 
and data collected during the observation period, 
implemented as a minimum standard by Jan. 1, 2018. 
The Federal Reserve expects to issue a proposal 
regarding implementation of this one-year measure 
after completion of the Basel Committee™s work, and 

in advance of the NSFR™s effective date of January 

2018. In October 2013, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued an NPR to implement the Basel III 
liquidity coverage ratio in the U.S. (ﬁProposed LCR 
Ruleﬂ). The agencies indicated that the Proposed 

LCR Rule is more stringent than the Basel III LCR in 
certain elements, including the eligibility of high-
quality liquid assets and an accelerated 
implementation timeline. Starting on Jan. 1, 2015, 

covered companies would be required to meet a liquidity coverage ratio of 80% percent, increasing 
annually by 10% increments until Jan. 1, 2017, at 
which time covered companies would be required to 
meet a liquidity coverage ratio of 100%. This 

proposal was open for comment until Jan. 31, 2014. Separately, the Final SIFI Rules address liquidity 
requirements for BHCs with $50 billion or more in 
total assets, including BNY Mellon. €These enhanced 

liquidity requirements include an independent review 
of liquidity risk management; establishment of cash 
flow projections, a contingency funding plan, and 
liquidity risk limits; liquidity stress testing under 
multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to 
the specific products and profile of the company; and 
maintenance of a liquidity buffer of unencumbered 

highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net 

cash outflows over 30 days under a range of stress 
scenarios. In the release accompanying those rules, 

the Federal Reserve states that these enhanced 
liquidity requirements are designed to complement 
the LCR.€The LCR would provide a standardized 

measure to allow comparison across BHCs, while the 
Final SIFI Rules™ internal stress test requirements 

provide a view of the BHC under various scenarios, 
time horizons, and tailored to the profile of the 
company. 
Volcker Rule and Related European Initiatives 

The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the U.S. banking 
agencies, the SEC and CFTC adopt rules that prohibit 
banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary 

trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge 
funds and private equity funds. This provision is 

commonly called the ﬁVolcker Ruleﬂ.  
On Dec. 10, 2013, final rules to implement the Volcker Rule were adopted.  Banks, including BNY 

Mellon, and affiliates must conform their covered 

activities and investments with the final Volcker Rule 

regulations by July 21, 2015, and are expected to 
engage in good-faith efforts that will result in 

conformance of all of their covered activities and 
investments by no later than the end of this 
conformance period. The final Volcker Rule will also 

require us to develop an extensive compliance 
program, subject to CEO attestation, addressing 
proprietary trading and covered fund activities. The Volcker Rule prohibits covered companies, 
including BNY Mellon, from engaging in proprietary 

trading and conditionally allows us to sponsor certain BNY Mellon 83 
(continued)U.S. and foreign private equity and hedge funds (ﬁcovered fundsﬂ). The designation of covered funds 

is expected to affect our ability to own or provide 

seed capital to launch new hedge funds, private 
equity funds and other covered funds. In addition, 

our ability to engage in certain transactions with 
covered funds (including, without limitation, certain 
U.S. funds for which BNY Mellon acts as both 

sponsor/manager and custodian) will be affected.  In 

general, the conditions limit us from owning interests 
in covered funds, prohibit the funds from sharing the 
same or similar name with a BNY Mellon affiliate, 

and restrict the way BNY Mellon can transact and 

service these funds. The restrictions concerning 

proprietary trading do not contain a broad exemption 
for asset-liability management functions, but contain 
more limited exceptions for, among other things, 

bona fide liquidity risk management and risk-
mitigating hedging activities, as well as certain 
classes of exempted instruments, including 
government securities. Ownership interests in 

covered funds that banking organizations organize 

and offer will be limited to 3% of the total 

outstanding ownership interests of any individual 
fund at any time more than one year after the date of 
its establishment, and with respect to the aggregate 
value of all such ownership interests in covered 
funds, 3% of the banking organization™s Tier 1 

capital. Moreover, beginning in the third quarter of 

2015, a banking entity relying on the final Volcker 

Rule™s exemption for sponsoring covered funds will 

need to deduct from its Tier 1 capital, the value of 

related ownership interests, calculated in accordance 
with the final rule. The final Volcker Rule is highly 

complex, and its full impact will not be known until 
market practices and structures are fully developed. 
BNY Mellon has until July 2015 to bring its covered 

activities and transactions into compliance, absent 
further extensions by the regulators. On Jan. 29, 2014, the European Commission (ﬁECﬂ) announced proposals concerning structural measures 
to improve the resilience of EU credit institutions, 
which will be similar in effect to the Volcker Rule, for 

the stated purpose of regulating the proprietary 
trading activities of large and complex banks.  The 

new rules would also give supervisors the power to 
require such banks to separate certain trading 
activities from their deposit-taking business. We are 

in the process of monitoring the evolution of these 
proposals to evaluate their impact on our European 
operations. Derivatives U.S. and EU regulators are in the process of implementing comprehensive rules governing the 
supervision, structure, trading and regulation of 
cleared and over-the-counter derivatives markets and 

participants. Dodd-Frank and the European Market 

Infrastructure Regulation (ﬁEMIRﬂ) each require or 
impose a large number of requirements in this area, 

many of which are not yet final. Once these rules are 

finalized, including with respect to how Dodd-Frank 
and EMIR complement each other in relation to 
cross-border activities, they could affect the way 

various BNY Mellon subsidiaries operate, including 

where and with whom they transact, and changes to 
the markets and participants will impact business 
models and profitability of certain BNY Mellon 

subsidiaries. Money Market Fund Reforms 
Regulators have focused on risks that money market funds (ﬁMMFsﬂ) may pose to financial stability.  In 

November 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council proposed several recommendations for 
money market mutual fund reform, which include 
requiring money market funds to use a floating net 
asset value, requiring them to maintain a capital 
buffer of up to 1% of a fund™s value coupled with a 

holdback of 3 to 5% on redemptions to create a ﬁfirst 
lossﬂ position and discourage runs, and requiring 
them to maintain a capital buffer of up to 3% of a 

fund™s value combined with other measures, such as 

investment diversification requirements, minimum 
liquidity levels, and/or more robust diversification 
requirements. In June 2013, the SEC issued proposed rules for institutional prime MMFs. The proposal sets forth 

two potential requirements, which could be adopted 
independently or combined. First, the SEC proposed 

to require institutional prime funds to float their net 
asset values. Second, the SEC proposed to limit 

redemptions during times of stress. Under this 

alternative, non-government MMFs would be 
required to impose a 2% liquidity fee and 30-day 
redemption gate if the fund™s level of weekly liquid 

assets fell below 15% of its total assets, unless the 
fund™s board determined that it was not in the best 

interest of the fund. That determination would be 

subject to the board™s fiduciary duty. 
 84 BNY Mellon 
(continued) Beyond these primary reform proposals, the SEC release proposed other potential changes, including 
tightening diversification requirements, enhancing 
disclosure requirements, strengthening stress testing 
and new reporting requirements for both MMFs and 
unregistered liquidity funds (these funds could serve 
as alternatives to money market funds for some 
investors). Meanwhile, EU legislation on MMFs proposed by the EC, which has been under consideration in the 
European Parliament, include: (i) requirements for 
ﬁconstant valueﬂ (ﬁCNAVﬂ) MMFs, including a 3% 

capital buffer; (ii) a requirement to perform internal 

credit ratings; (iii) restrictions on the types of assets 
in which MMFs can invest, including with respect to 
asset-backed commercial paper; (iv) diversification 
restrictions, including on collateral received on 
reverse repurchase agreements; (v) a prohibition or 
restriction of use of amortized cost accounting in 
ﬁvariableﬂ NAV funds; (vi) a possible ban on MMF-

level ratings, and (vii) stricter disclosure 

requirements. The final regulation is expected to be 

adopted later in 2014, with subsequent transition 
period before taking full effect. 
Tri-Party Repo Reform 

BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 

party repurchase, or repo, market. As agent, we 

facilitate settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) 
and investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and investor 
agree to a tri-party repo trade and send instructions to 
us. We settle the trade, maintain custody of the 

collateral (the subject securities of the repo), monitor 
the eligibility and sufficiency of the collateral, and 

execute the payment and delivery instructions agreed 
to and provided by the principles. examine systemic risks in various financial markets, 
including the tri-party repo market. The Payment 

Risk Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York sponsored a Task Force on Tri-Party Repo 


party repo market and to decide what changes should 
be implemented so that such risks may be mitigated 
or avoided in the future. The Task Force issued its 

recommendations on May 17, 2010 and its final 
report regarding the tri-party repo market on Feb. 15, 
2012. BNY Mellon continues to work to significantly 

reduce the risk associated with the secured intraday 

party repo trades. BNY Mellon has implemented 

several important measures in that regard, 
including€reducing the amount of time during which 
we extend intraday credit, implementing three-way 
trade confirmations, reducing the amount of credit 
provided in connection with processing collateral 
substitutions, introducing a functionality that enables 
us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades into new trades without 
extending credit, and requiring dealers to prefund 
their repayment obligations in connection with trades 
collateralized by DTC sourced securities. 
Additionally, in 2013, we limited the collateral 

eligible to secure intraday credit to certain more 
liquid asset classes, resulting in a reduction of 
exposures secured by less liquid forms of collateral. 
We anticipate that the combination of these measures 

will have reduced risks substantially in our tri-party 
repo activity in the near term and, together with 
technology enhancements currently in development, 
will achieve the practical elimination (defined as a 
90% reduction) of intraday credit related to tri-party 
repo processing by the end of 2014. Since May 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has released monthly reports on the tri-party 

repo market, including information on aggregate 
volumes of collateral used in all tri-party repo 
transactions by asset class, concentrations, and 
margin levels, which is available at http:// 

www.newyorkfed.org/banking/tpr_infr_reform.html
. Resolution Planning 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a final rule requiring 
certain organizations, including each BHC with 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, to report 
periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its 
rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material 
financial distress or failure. In addition, the FDIC 

issued a final rule that requires insured depository 
institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, 
such as The Bank of New York Mellon, to submit to 

the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of 
the institution™s failure. 
The two resolution plan rules are complementary, and 
we submitted our resolution plan in conformity with 
both rules. The public portions of our resolution plan 
BNY Mellon 85 
 (continued)are available on the FDIC™s website.  We are required 
to submit updated resolution plans annually.  
Resolution planning efforts might also become 
required in foreign jurisdictions where we have 
operations. We submitted the first phase of our UK 

resolution plan to the Financial Services Authority 

(ﬁFSAﬂ) in June 2012. In the EU, recent legislation on bank structural reform proposed by the EC has focused on addressing 
transparency of any collateral movements where legal 
title passes in relation to securities financing 
transactions (ﬁSFTsﬂ), which include repos and 

securities lending arrangements. Accordingly, 

information requirements are proposed for imposition 
on market participants engaging in SFTs, including 

the composition of the underlying collateral, if the 
underlying collateral is available for use or has been 
used, and the haircuts applied. It is proposed that 

reporting requirements would be leveraged of

existing infrastructures and processes, e.g., the 
reporting of derivative contracts to a trade repository 
as required under EMIR. Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company If the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution such as The Bank 

of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., upon its 

insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has 
the power to: Ł Transfer any of the depository institution™s assets 
and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly 
formed ﬁbridgeﬂ bank without the approval of the 
depository institution™s creditors; 
Ł Enforce the terms of the depository institution™s 
contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to 
any provisions triggered by the appointment of 
the FDIC in that capacity; or Ł Repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to 
which the depository institution is a party, the 

performance of which is determined by the FDIC 
to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or 

repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC 
to promote the orderly administration of the 
depository institution. In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders 

of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for 
administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other 

general unsecured claims against such an institution, 
including claims of debt holders of the institution, in 
the ﬁliquidation or other resolutionﬂ of such an 
institution by any receiver.  As a result, whether or 

not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt 
obligations of The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A., the debt holders would be treated 
differently from, and could receive, if anything, 

substantially less than, the depositors of the bank. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime 
(known as the ﬁorderly liquidation authorityﬂ) for 
systemically important non-bank financial 
companies, including BHCs and their affiliates.  

Under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC 

may be appointed as receiver for the systemically 
important institution, and its failed non-bank 
subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the entity if, 
among other conditions, it is determined at the time 
of the institution™s failure that it is in default or in 

danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the 
stability of the U.S. financial system. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, 

and the rights and obligations of creditors and other 
parties who have dealt with the institution, would be 
determined under the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, and 

not under the insolvency law that would otherwise 
apply.  The powers of the receiver under the orderly 

liquidation authority were based on the powers of the 
FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the 
FDI Act.  However, the provisions governing the 

rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation 
authority were modified in certain respects to reduce 
disparities with the treatment of creditors™ claims 

under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as compared to the 
treatment of those claims under the new authority.  

Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of 

creditors exist as between these two regimes, 
including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict 
priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the 
use of an administrative claims procedure to 
determine creditors™ claims (as opposed to the judicial 

procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and 
the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a ﬁbridgeﬂ 
entity. 
The orderly liquidation authority provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment.  

However, a number of rulemakings are required 

under the terms of Dodd-Frank, and a number of  86 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) provisions of the new authority require clarification. The FDIC has completed its initial phase of 
rulemaking under the orderly liquidation authority, 

but additional rules are under consideration. These 

rules may affect the manner in which the new 

authority is applied, particularly with respect to 
broker-dealer and futures commission merchant 

subsidiaries of BHCs. In December 2013, the FDIC released a notice outlining the single point of entry (ﬁSPOEﬂ) strategy 
and soliciting comments on how a SPOE resolution 
approach would be implemented in the U.S. A SPOE 

approach would replace a distressed BHC with a 
bridge holding company, which could then continue 

subsidiary bank operations. The agencies may 

require minimum amounts of equity and unsecured 
debt at the holding company level to assist in 
implementing the SPOE strategy. 
It is expected that EU legislation will differ 
significantly from the U.S. SPOE approach, which is 
addressed more specifically below in the ﬁOperations 
and Regulations Outside of the United Statesﬂ 
discussion. Depositor Preference 
Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for 
administrative expenses and employee compensation 
against an insured depository institution are afforded 

a priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such an institution, including federal funds and letters 
of credit, in the ﬁliquidation or other resolutionﬂ of 
such an institution by any receiver.  The UK 

Prudential Regulatory Authority (ﬁPRAﬂ) (formerly 

the Financial Services Authority) published a 

consultation paper in September 2012 concerning the 
implications of national depositor preference regimes 
of countries not within the European Economic Area 

(ﬁEEAﬂ) (including, among others, the U.S.) that 
prioritize the claims of home-country depositors over 
those of depositors outside the home country if a 
deposit taking banking organization becomes 

insolvent. The proposed PRA rules would prohibit 

firms, including BNY Mellon, from non-EEA 

countries that operate such regimes from accepting 
deposits through a UK branch, unless measures are 
introduced to eliminate the perceived disadvantage to 
UK depositors caused by the subordination of their 
claims in favor of home country depositors. The 

proposal would also require certain depositor notice 
undertakings. The PRA initially intended that these 
new standards would start to take effect by January 

2013, with a full compliance deadline of January 
2015, but the consultation period for its proposal was 
extended to Jan. 31, 2013. The PRA has not taken 

further action on its proposal. As a result of this proposal, U.S. banks may change their deposit agreements to make UK branch deposits 
payable in the U.S. to provide depositor preference to 
UK branch deposits. The FDIC issued a final rule in 

September 2013 clarifying that these UK branch 
deposits payable in the U.S. are not FDIC insured. Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Transactions between BNY Mellon™s bank 
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and BNY Mellon and 

its non-bank subsidiaries, on the other, are regulated 

by the Federal Reserve. These regulations limit the 

types and amounts of transactions (including loans 
due and extensions of credit from the U.S. bank 
subsidiaries) that may take place and generally 
require those transactions to be on an arm™s-length 

basis. These regulations generally do not apply to 

transactions between a U.S. bank subsidiary and its 
subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require that 

any extensions of credit by a BNY Mellon bank 

subsidiary to BNY Mellon or to a BNY Mellon non-

bank subsidiary must be secured by designated 
amounts of specified collateral and are limited, as to 
any one of BNY Mellon or such non-bank affiliates, 

to 10% of the lending bank™s capital stock and 

surplus, and, as to BNY Mellon and all such non-

bank affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of such 

lending bank™s capital stock and surplus.  
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the 
coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate 

transactions within a banking organization.  For 

example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank 
Act required that the 10% of capital limit on covered 
transactions apply to financial subsidiaries. 
Commencing in July 2012, Dodd-Frank also 
expanded the definition of a ﬁcovered transactionﬂ to 
include derivatives transactions and securities lending 
transactions with a non-bank affiliate under which a 

bank (or its subsidiary) has credit exposure (with the 
term ﬁcredit exposureﬂ to be defined by the Federal 
Reserve under its existing rulemaking authority). 
Collateral requirements will apply to such 
transactions as well as to certain repurchase and 
reverse repurchase agreements. BNY Mellon 87 
   (continued)Deposit Insurance Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of 
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., accept 

deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC 
insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit 

for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 
for each depositor account. Under the FDI Act, 

insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC 
upon a finding that the insured depository institution 
has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an 
unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or 
has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, 

order or condition imposed by a bank™s federal 

regulatory agency. 
The FDIC™s Deposit Insurance Fund (the ﬁDIFﬂ) is 
funded by assessments on insured depository 
institutions. The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based 

on a bank™s average consolidated total assets, less the 

average tangible equity of the insured depository 
institution during the assessment period. For larger 

institutions, such as The Bank of New York Mellon 

and BNY Mellon, N.A., assessments are determined 

based on CAMELS ratings and forward-looking 
financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, 
which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the 
assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FDIC to 
determine whether and to what extent adjustments to 
the assessment base are appropriate for custody 
banks. During 2011, the FDIC concluded that certain 

liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit 
insurance assessment base of custody banks that 
satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. This 

has the effect of reducing the amount of DIF 

insurance premiums due from custody banks. The 

Bank of New York Mellon is a custody bank for this 

purpose. The custody bank assessment adjustment 

may not exceed total transaction account deposits 
identified by the institution as being directly linked to 
a fiduciary or custody and safekeeping asset. Source of Strength and Liability of Affiliates 

Federal Reserve policy historically has required BHCs to act as a source of strength to their bank 
subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial 
resources to support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-

Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory 

requirement. Such support may be required by the 

Federal Reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. In addition, any loans by 

BNY Mellon to its bank subsidiaries would be 

subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to 
certain other indebtedness of its banks. In the event 

of a BHC™s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC 

to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a 
subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy 
trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. In 

addition, in certain circumstances BNY Mellon™s 

insured depository institutions could be assessed for 
losses incurred by another BNY Mellon insured 

depository institution. In the event of impairment of 

the capital stock of one of BNY Mellon™s national 

banks or The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY 

Mellon, as the banks™ stockholder, could be required 

to pay such deficiency. 
Incentive Compensation Arrangements Proposal 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to 
prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding 
incentive-based compensation practices at certain 
financial institutions. On April€14, 2011, federal 

regulators including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve 
and the SEC, issued a proposed rule which, among 
other things, would require certain executive officers 

of covered financial institutions with total 
consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as 
ours, to defer at least 50% of their annual incentive-
based compensation for a minimum of three years. 
The comment period on the proposed rule closed 
May€31, 2011.  Final regulations have not been issued 

as of this date. Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial 
institutions has been aimed at combating money 
laundering and terrorist financing.€The USA 

PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains numerous anti-money 

laundering requirements for financial institutions that 
are applicable to BNY Mellon™s bank, broker-dealer 

and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds 
and private investment companies advised or 
sponsored by our subsidiaries.€Those regulations 

impose obligations on financial institutions to 
maintain appropriate policies, procedures and 
controls to detect, prevent and report money 
laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the 
identity of their customers.€Certain of those 

regulations impose specific due diligence 
requirements on financial institutions that maintain  88 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Privacy 
The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including 
BNY Mellon, from disclosing nonpublic personal 

financial information of consumer customers to third 
parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 
unless customers have the opportunity to ﬁopt outﬂ of 
the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act 

restricts information sharing among affiliates for 

marketing purposes. Acquisitions 
Federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving 

depository institutions or BHCs. The BHC Act 

requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for 
the direct or indirect acquisition by a BHC of more 
than 5% of any class of the voting shares or all or 
substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank, 
savings and loan association or BHC. In reviewing 

bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank 

regulatory authorities will consider, among other 

things, the competitive effect of the transaction, 

financial and managerial issues including the capital 
position of the combined organization, convenience 

and needs factors, including the applicant™s record 

under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 

which requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit 
needs of their communities (including credit to low 
and moderate income individuals and geographies) 
and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in 

combating money laundering activities. In addition, 

prior Federal Reserve approval would be required for 
certain large non-banking acquisitions and 

investments. Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary 
Regulatory Requirements BNY Mellon is regulated as a BHC and a financial 
holding company (ﬁFHCﬂ) under the Bank Holding 
Company 

Leach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the 

ﬁBHC Actﬂ).  We are subject to supervision by the 

Federal Reserve. In general, the BHC Act limits a 

BHC™s business activities to banking, managing or 

controlling banks, performing certain servicing 
activities for subsidiaries, engaging in activities incidental to banking, and engaging in any activity, or 

acquiring and retaining the shares of any company 
engaged in any activity, that is either financial in 

nature or complementary to a financial activity and 
does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and 
soundness of depository institutions or the financial 
system generally.  
A BHC™s ability to maintain FHC status is dependent 
upon a number of factors, including: Ł its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under the 
prompt corrective regulations of the appropriate 
regulatory agency (discussed above under 
ﬁPrompt Corrective Actionﬂ); and 
Ł the BHC itself, qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under 
applicable Federal Reserve regulations. An FHC that does not continue to meet all the 
requirements for FHC status will, depending on 
which requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to 
undertake new activities, or make acquisitions, that 
are not generally permissible for BHCs without FHC 
status or to continue such activities. The Bank of New York Mellon, which is BNY 
Mellon™s largest bank subsidiary, is a New York state 

chartered bank, a member of the Federal Reserve 
System and subject to regulation, supervision and 
examination by the Federal Reserve and the New 
York State Department of Financial Services.  BNY 

Mellon™s national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, 

N.A. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust 

Company, National Association, are chartered as 

national banking associations subject to primary 
regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in 
securities underwriting and other broker-dealer 

activities in the United States. These companies are 

SEC-registered broker-dealers and members of 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 

(ﬁFINRAﬂ), a securities industry self-regulatory 
organization.  BNY Mellon™s non-bank subsidiaries 

engaged in securities-related activities are regulated 
by supervisory agencies in the countries in which 
they conduct business. Certain of BNY Mellon™s public finance and advisory 
activities are regulated by the Municipal Securities BNY Mellon 89 
    (continued)Rulemaking Board. The SEC issued its final 
Municipal Advisors Rule in September 2013 to 

require municipal advisors to register with the SEC if 
they provide advice to municipal entities or certain 
other persons on the issuance of municipal securities, 
or about certain investment strategies or municipal 
derivatives. The Municipal Advisors Rule becomes 

effective on July 1, 2014. 
Certain of BNY Mellon™s subsidiaries are registered 
with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or 
commodity trading advisors and, as such, are subject 
to CFTC regulation. BNY Mellon also has a 

subsidiary that clears futures and derivatives trades 
on behalf of institutional clients and is registered with 
the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a 
member of the National Futures Association.  The 

Bank of New York Mellon provisionally registered as 

a Swap Dealer (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) 

with the CFTC, through the National Futures 
Association. As a Swap Dealer, The Bank of New 

York Mellon is subject to regulation, supervision and 

examination by the CFTC. In connection with certain 

Dodd-Frank clearing requirements, The Bank of New 

York Mellon became a member of LCH Clearnet 

Limited™s SwapClear interest rate swap clearing 

service in 2012. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 

as amended, and as such are supervised by the SEC. 
They are also subject to various U.S. federal and state 
laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations 
of any countries in which they conduct business. Our 

subsidiaries advise both public investment companies 
which are registered with the SEC under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ﬁ™40 Actﬂ), 

including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, and 
private investment companies which are not 
registered under the ‚40 Act.  
Certain of our investment management, trust and custody operations provide services to employee 
benefit plans that are subject to the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 

(ﬁERISAﬂ), administered by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.  ERISA imposes certain statutory duties, 

liabilities, disclosure obligations, and restrictions on 
fiduciaries, as applicable, related to the services being 
performed and fees being paid. Certain proposed 

expansions of the definition of a fiduciary could 
require certain BNY Mellon businesses to modify 
their practices, which could adversely affect results of 

such businesses. Operations and Regulations Outside of the United States In Europe, branches of The Bank of New York 
Mellon are subject to regulation in the countries in 
which they are established, in addition to being 
subject to oversight by the US regulators referred to 
above. The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV 

(ﬁBNY Mellon SA/NVﬂ) is a public limited liability 

company incorporated under the laws of Belgium. 
BNY Mellon SA/NV, which has been granted a 

banking license by the National Bank of Belgium, is 
authorized to carry out all banking and savings 
activities as a credit institution. BNY Mellon SA/NV 

conducts its activities in Belgium as well as through 
branch offices in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, 

the Netherlands, France and Germany. 
Effective Feb. 1, 2013, The Bank of New York 
Mellon (Ireland) Limited (the ﬁIrish Bankﬂ) merged 

with the BNY Mellon SA/NV.  As part of the merger 

process, BNY Mellon SA/NV established a branch in 

Ireland. As of Feb. 1, 2013, this branch carries on the 

business activity in Ireland that was previously 
conducted by the Irish Bank. Certain of our financial services operations in the UK are subject to regulation and supervision by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (ﬁFCAﬂ) and the 

Prudential Regulation Authority (ﬁPRAﬂ), whose 

functions were transferred to them from the previous 
Financial Services Authority effective April 1, 2013. 

The PRA is responsible for the authorization and 

prudential regulation of firms that carry on PRA-
regulated activities, including banks. PRA-

authorized firms are also subject to regulation by the 
FCA for conduct purposes.  In contrast, FCA-

authorized firms (such as investment management 
firms) have the FCA as their sole regulator for both 

prudential and conduct purposes although subject to 
the residual overarching jurisdiction of the PRA, if 
matters of systemic significance are in issue. As a 

result, FCA-authorized firms must comply with FCA 
prudential and conduct rules and the FCA™s Principles 

for Businesses, while dual-regulated firms must 
comply with the FCA conduct rules and FCA 

Principles, as well as the applicable PRA prudential 

rules and the PRA™s Principles for Businesses. 
 90 BNY Mellon 
     (continued) The PRA regulates The Bank of New York Mellon 
(International) Limited, our UK incorporated bank, as 
well as the UK branches of The Bank of New York 

Mellon and BNY Mellon SA/NV.  Certain of BNY 

Mellon™s UK incorporated subsidiaries are authorized 

to conduct investment business in the UK. Their 

investment management advisory activities and their 
sale and marketing of retail investment products are 
regulated by the FCA. Certain UK investment funds, 

including BNY Mellon Investment Funds, are 

registered with the FCA and are offered for retail sale 

in the UK. Since the financial crisis, the European Union and its Member States have, in the same way as their US 
counterparts, engaged in a significant overhaul of 
bank regulation and supervision. To increase the 

resilience of banks and to reduce the impact of 
potential bank failures, new rules on capital 
requirements for banks and bank recovery and 
resolution have been adopted. The EU™s Banking 

Union (described further below) has been launched. 
Further measures are under way, including providing 

for a structural separation of the risks associated with 
certain banks™ trading activities from their deposit-

taking function. Proposed legislation for a Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, which contemplates a recovery 
and resolution framework for the EU, moved from 
the European Parliament to the European Council for 
consideration in December 2013. This directive 

would provide for resolution planning and a set of 
harmonized powers to resolve or implement recovery 
of relevant institutions, including branches of non-
European Economic Area (ﬁEEAﬂ) banks operating 

within the EEA. The directive includes the 

preparation of recovery and resolution plans, giving 
relevant EEA regulators powers to impose 

requirements on an institution before resolution 
actions become necessary; a set of resolution tools 
and powers to facilitate the resolution of failing 
entities, such as the power to ﬁbail-inﬂ the debt of an 
institution (including certain deposit obligations); and 
the power to require a firm to change its structure to 
remove impediments to resolvability.  Unlike in the 

United States, where an SPOE approach is expected 
to be implemented, it provides for a ﬁmultiple points 
of entryﬂ approach coupled with intra-group bail-in 
requirements. Aspects of the Banking Union will enter into force Nov. 4, 2014.  The key components of the Banking 
Union include a single resolution mechanism 
(ﬁSRMﬂ) and a single supervisory mechanism 
(ﬁSSMﬂ). In December 2013, the European Council set out its general approach on the SRM. This approach 

endorses the bail-in rules established in the Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive. It provides for a 

Resolution Fund, which is to be funded by the 
banking industry.  It also provides for a single 

resolution board with broad powers in case of bank 
resolution. Finally, it provides for EU Member States 

entering into cooperation agreements with non-EEA 
countries with the caveat that in certain circumstances 
they can refuse to recognize proceedings. This SRM 

approach has not been adopted yet, and the EU 
Parliament is expected to continue negotiations in 
early 2014. Various BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches are expected to fall within the scope of this 
Directive. In addition, the Capital Requirements Directive IV (and related Regulation) (ﬁCRD IVﬂ) will affect BNY 

Mellon™s EU subsidiaries by implementing Basel III 

and other changes, including the enhancement of the 
quality of capital, and the strengthening of capital 
requirements for counterparty credit risk, resulting in 
higher capital requirements. In the EU Member 

States, the CRD IV introduces substantive parts of the 

new European supervisory architecture, including the 
development of the Single Rule Book for financial 
services. A ﬁSingle Rule Bookﬂ is to replace existing 

separately implemented rules within EU Member 
States, with a harmonized approach to 
implementation across the EU. Elements of CRD IV 

will apply not only to BNY Mellon banking branches 

and subsidiaries but also to investment management 
and brokerage entities. The CRD IV became 

effective on Jan. 1, 2014, with certain provisions 

phased in from 2014 to 2019. Our Investment Management and Investment Services businesses are subject to significant 
regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
relating to, among other things, the safeguarding, 
administration and management of client assets and 
client funds. Various new and revised European 

Directives will impact our provision of these services, 
including revisions to the Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive, the new Alternative 

Investment Fund Managers Directive, the Directive 
on Undertakings for Collective Investments in 
Transferable Securities, the Central Securities 
BNY Mellon 91 
(continued)Depository Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the Securities Law 
Legislation. These new and revised European 

Directives will impact our operations and risk profile 
and provide new opportunities for the provision of 
BNY Mellon products and services. 
The types of activities in which the foreign branches of our banking subsidiaries and our international 
subsidiaries may engage are subject to various 
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those 

foreign branches and international subsidiaries are 
also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of 
the countries in which they operate and, in the case of 
banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory 
capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they 
operate. As of Dec. 31, 2013, each of BNY Mellon™s 

non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios 
above their specified minimum requirements. European Central Bank SSM and Comprehensive 
Assessments In October 2013, the European Council adopted regulations creating an SSM to oversee banks and 
other credit institutions. The SSM will be composed 

of the European Central Bank (the ﬁECBﬂ) and the 
supervisory authorities of the member states. It will 

cover the prudential supervision of all major banks in 
the 18 countries comprising the Eurozone and non-
Eurozone countries that choose to participate through 
close cooperation agreements. The ECB will have 
direct oversight of Eurozone banks, although the 
extent of its oversight will be differentiated and made 

in close cooperation with national supervisors. The 

ECB will assume its supervisory tasks in November 
2014. In advance of the SSM, the ECB began in November 2013 a comprehensive assessment of certain credit 
institutions, which due to their size and systemic 
characteristics, fall under direct supervision by the 
ECB. The assessment consists of a supervisory risk 

assessment of key risks, an asset quality review to 
enhance transparency of bank assets, and a stress test 
to review the resiliency of bank balance sheets, which 
will be conducted in conjunction with the European 
Banking Authority.  This assessment is expected to 

continue until November 2014. The Bank of New 

York Mellon SA/NV, our Belgian banking subsidiary, 

is included in this exercise.€On Jan. 29, 2014, in addition to the proposed new rules on structural reform of the European Union 
banking sector referred to above, the EC adopted 
accompanying measures aimed at increasing 
transparency of certain transactions in the ﬁshadow 
bankingﬂ sector, including for providing for enhanced 

transparency and reporting of SFTs (securities 

financing transactions). The proposal on structural 

reform of European Union banks is intended to apply 
only to the largest and most complex European Union 

banks with significant trading activities.  92 BNY Mellon 
 Making or continuing an investment in securities issued by us, including our common stock, involves 
certain risks that you should carefully consider.  The 

following discussion sets forth the most significant 
risk factors that could affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. However, other 

factors, besides those discussed below or in other of 
our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also 
could adversely affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. We cannot assure 

you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere 
in our reports address all potential risks that we may 
face. These risk factors also serve to describe factors 

which may cause our results to differ materially from 

those described in forward-looking statements 
included herein or in other documents or statements 
that make reference to this Annual Report.  See 

ﬁForward-looking Statements.ﬂ Operational and Business Risk 
We are subject to extensive government regulation 
and supervision and have been impacted by a 
significant amount of rulemaking as a result of the 
2008 financial crisis. Failure to comply with these 

regulations could have a material adverse effect on 

our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment, and 
are subject to a comprehensive statutory and 
regulatory regime, including oversight by 
governmental agencies both in the U.S. and outside 
the U.S. In light of the 2008 financial crisis, 

domestic and international policy makers are 
increasing their focus on the financial services 
industry.  New or modified regulations and related 

regulatory guidance are significantly altering the 
regulatory framework in which we operate and may 
have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on us 

or the financial services industry more generally. 
The regulatory and supervisory focus of U.S. banking agencies is primarily intended to protect the safety 
and soundness of the banking system and federally 
insured deposits, and not to protect our shareholders 
or creditors. Additionally, banking regulators have 

wide discretion in the ongoing examination and the 
enforcement of applicable banking statutes, 
regulations, and guidelines, and may restrict our 
ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions, 
or may require us to maintain more capital. In common with their U.S. counterparts, European 
policy makers and regulators have also increased 
their focus on financial services providers and our 
European operations are being directly affected and 

will continue to be affected by the changes to the 

regulatory environment that those regulators are 
driving. Other provisions in recent legislative and regulatory changes or proposals impact or are likely to impact 
BNY Mellon, including: 
Ł Leverage and Risk-Based Capital Standards
. The 
Final Capital Rules issued by the U.S. banking 
agencies in July 2013 revise the capital 
framework applicable to U.S. bank holding 
companies and banks, including by redefining the 
components of capital, establishing higher 
minimum percentages for applicable capital 
ratios, revising the general risk-based capital 
rules, and introducing a supplementary leverage 
ratio. The Final Capital Rules subject U.S. bank 

holding companies and banks, including BNY 
Mellon and its banking subsidiaries, to more 
stringent capital requirements, which could 
restrict growth, activities or operations, or trigger 
divestiture of assets or operations. We must also 

separately obtain final approval from the agencies 
for the use of certain models used to calculate 
risk-weighted assets under Basel III™s Advanced 

Approaches. While the U.S. agencies have not 

yet finalized a capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs, 

we currently expect to be subject to a surcharge 

of 1.0%. Impacts could include, but are not 

limited to, potential dilution of existing 
stockholders, and competitive disadvantage 
compared to financial institutions not under the 
same regulatory framework; Ł Additional Supplementary Leverage Ratio 
Proposals
. In addition to the Final Capital Rules, 

the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 proposed 
a buffer to the supplementary leverage ratio for 

the largest U.S. bank holding companies and 

banks, including BNY Mellon and its principal 

banking subsidiaries, to become effective Jan. 1, 

2018. The Basel Committee also proposed to 

revise exposure measurement methodologies in 
June of 2013 and finalized the revisions, with 
changes, in January of 2014. The supplementary 

leverage ratio is expected to subject BNY Mellon 

to a more stringent leverage requirement, which BNY Mellon 93 
(continued)includes certain off-balance sheet items, which 
could restrict growth, activities or operations; Ł The Volcker Rule
. On Dec. 10, 2013, the final 
rules to implement the Volcker Rule were 

adopted. The Volcker Rule prohibits us from 

engaging in proprietary trading and conditionally 
allows us to sponsor certain U.S. and foreign 
private equity and hedge funds (ﬁcovered fundsﬂ). 
The conditions limit us from owning interests in 
covered funds, prohibit the funds from sharing 
the same or similar name with a BNY Mellon 

affiliate, and restrict the way BNY Mellon can 

transact and service these funds. BNY Mellon 

has until July 2015 to bring its proprietary trading 
and covered fund activities and transactions into 
compliance, absent further extensions by the 
regulators. Should regulators not exercise their 

authority to permit organizations to retain certain 

investments, including certain illiquid 
investments, beyond the conformance period, we 
could incur losses when disposing of such 
investments. We could be forced to sell such 

investments at a discount in the secondary market 
as a result of both the constrained timing of such 
sales and the possibility that other financial 
institutions are likewise liquidating investments 
at the same time. Resolving the name prohibition 

may involve significant legal, marketing and 
compliance costs that are not quantifiable at this 
time and could vary based on how the prohibition 
is implemented by the regulators. The servicing 

restrictions could impact BNY Mellon™s ability to 

provide certain ancillary lending functions to 
covered funds that we custody, which could 

constrain our ability to perform this function or 
act as custodian. Our ownership interest in 

covered funds that we organize and offer will be 

limited to 3% of the total outstanding ownership 
interests of any individual fund at any time more 
than one year after the date of its establishment, 
and with respect to the aggregate value of all such 
ownership interests in covered funds, 3% of our 
Tier 1 capital.  Moreover, beginning in the third 

quarter of 2015, we expect to be required to 
deduct from Tier 1 capital the value of our 

ownership interests in such covered funds, 
calculated in accordance with the final rule. The 

Volcker Rule also contains extensive compliance 

and recordkeeping requirements, which could 
increase the costs of operations; Ł Liquidity Risk Management. Basel III established 
two minimum liquidity risk measures. The 

liquidity coverage ratio (ﬁLCRﬂ) measures the 
amount of unencumbered, high-quality, liquid 

assets relative to net cash outflows an institution 
could encounter under a significant 30-day stress 
scenario, and is designed to allow an institution to 
withstand such liquidity stress. The net stable 

funding ratio (ﬁNSFRﬂ) is designed to address 
longer-term liquidity mismatch concerns, by 


term funding over a one-year period. Depending 

upon the final contours of the LCR and NSFR as 
ultimately implemented in the U.S., these 
requirements could require BNY Mellon to 

increase its holdings of high-quality, and 

potentially lower-yielding, liquid assets, and to 

reevaluate the composition of its liabilities 
structure to include more longer-dated debt; 
Ł Orderly Liquidation Authority ﬁSingle Point of 

Entryﬂ. A ﬁsingle point of entryﬂ approach would 

replace a distressed bank holding company with a 
bridge holding company, which could continue 

subsidiary bank operations. The FDIC recently 

released a notice describing a potential single 
point of entry strategy, outlining its perspectives 

and soliciting comments on how a single point of 
entry resolution approach could be implemented 
in the U.S. The agencies may set minimum 

amounts of equity and unsecured debt at the 
holding company level to assist in implementing 
the single point of entry strategy; Ł Money Market Mutual Fund Reform. In June 
2013, the SEC issued a series of policy proposals 
designed to enhance money market fund 
regulation, including limitations on redemptions, 
liquidity fees, and requiring money market funds 
to float their net asset value. The European 

Union has proposed similar initiatives affecting 

our European money market funds business. If 

these reforms cause the money market mutual 
fund market to contract, our business as a servicer 
and manager of such funds could be impacted; Ł Tri-Party Repo Reform
. The Task Force on Tri-
Party Repo Infrastructure Reform™s review of the 

risks in the tri-party repo market, and associated 
recommendations, may increase our compliance 
costs and has required us to implement several 
measures to change how tri-party repo 
transactions are conducted;  94 BNY Mellon 
   (continued) Ł Resolution Planning. Large BHCs must develop 
and submit to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve for review resolution plans for their rapid and 
orderly resolution in the event of material 
financial distress or failure. If the FDIC and the 

Federal Reserve jointly determine that our plan is 
not credible and we fail to address the 
deficiencies in a timely manner, the FDIC and the 

Federal Reserve may jointly impose more 
stringent capital, leverage or liquidity 
requirements or restrictions on our growth, 
activities or operations. Ultimately, we could be 

required to divest assets or operations that the 
regulators determine necessary to facilitate our 
orderly resolution if we fail to adequately remedy 
any deficiencies identified in our plan within two 
years; Ł Enhanced Prudential Standards/Single 

Counterparty Credit Limits
. Under the Dodd-

Frank Act, we are considered to be a systemically 

important financial institution and are subject to 
heightened prudential standards and supervision. 
Final enhanced prudential standards issued by the 
Federal Reserve could increase our operational, 
compliance and risk management costs. Other 

proposed enhanced prudential standards 
applicable to SIFIs under the Dodd-Frank Act, 

and similar Basel Committee initiatives, could 
limit single counterparty credit exposures, and 
could result in our needing to limit certain 
business volumes to be able to comply with such 
limits; Ł European Resolution and Structural Reform 

Proposals
. European legislators have initiated proposals to establish European bank resolution 
mechanisms to operate across the Eurozone. In 

December 2013, the EU Council set out its 
general approach on the resolution mechanism to 
be applied to Europe. Their approach endorses 

the bail-in rules established in the European Bank 
Recovery and Resolution Directive. It provides 

for a ﬁResolution Fundﬂ, which is to be funded by 
the banking industry.  It also provides for a single 

resolution board with broad powers in case of 
bank resolution. Finally, it provides for EU 

Member States entering into cooperation 
agreements with non-EEA countries with the 

caveat that in certain circumstances they can 
refuse to recognize proceedings. This approach 

has not been adopted yet, and the EU Parliament 
is expected to continue negotiations in early 2014. Unlike in the United States, it provides for 

a ﬁmultiple points of entryﬂ approach coupled 
with intra-group bail-in requirements. Various 

BNY Mellon subsidiaries and branches are 

expected to fall within the scope of this Directive. 
With regard to other structural reforms, on Jan. 

29, 2014, the EC proposed new rules on 
structural reform of the EU banking sector for the 
stated purpose of regulating the proprietary 
trading activities of large and complex banks. The 

new rules would also give supervisors the power 
to require such banks to separate certain trading 
activities from their deposit-taking business. The 

proposal on structural reform of EU banks is 
intended to apply only to the largest and most 

complex EU banks with significant trading 
activities. Various BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches are expected to fall within the scope of 
this Directive and the effects on our European 

businesses could be similar to the effect of 

various Volcker Rule proposals; and 
Ł Investment Services in Europe
. The Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive 
(ﬁAIFMDﬂ), which is coming into force 
progressively in 2014, is having a direct effect on 

our alternative fund manager clients and our 
depository business and other products offered 

across Europe. AIFMD imposes heightened 

depository obligations, which have both 
operational and, potentially, capital effects.  Our 

businesses servicing regulated funds in Europe 
will be affected similarly by the revised directive 

governing undertakings for collective investment 
in transferable securities, known as UCITS IV, 

anticipated to be formally adopted in the third 
quarter of 2014 and to take effect two years after 

that. In addition, U.S. regulatory agencies - banking, 
securities and commodities - continue to publish 
notices of proposed regulations required by the Dodd-
Frank Act, and new bodies created by the Dodd-

Frank Act (including the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council and the Consumer Finance Protection 
Bureau) have commenced operations. The related 

findings of various regulatory and commission 
studies, the interpretations issued as part of the 
rulemaking process and the final regulations that are 
issued with respect to various elements of the new 
law may cause changes that impact the profitability of 
our business activities and require that we change 
certain of our business practices and plans. These 
BNY Mellon 95 
(continued)changes will continue to expose us to additional regulatory costs and require us to invest significant 
management attention and resources to make any 
necessary changes, all of which could impact our 
profitability.  See ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in 

this Annual Report for additional information 

regarding the potential impact of the regulatory 
environment on our business. Failure to comply with these regulations, as well as other laws, regulations or policies could result in 
sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money 
penalties and reputational damage, which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial 

condition and results of operations. Although we 

have policies and procedures designed to prevent any 
such violations, there can be no assurance that such 
violations will not occur.  If violations do occur, they 

could damage our reputation, increase our legal and 
compliance costs, and ultimately adversely impact 
our results of operations. Laws, regulations or 

policies currently affecting us and our subsidiaries 

may change at any time. Regulatory authorities may 

also change their interpretation of these statutes and 
regulations. Therefore, our business may also be 

adversely affected by future changes in laws, 

regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory 
approaches to compliance and enforcement. See 

ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in this Annual Report. 
Regulatory actions or litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm 

our businesses or reputation. Like many major financial institutions, we are the subject of inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and 
proceedings by counterparties, clients, other third 
parties and regulatory and other governmental 
agencies in the United States and abroad, as well as 
the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. 
See ﬁLegal proceedingsﬂ in Note 22 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report for a discussion of material legal and 
regulatory proceedings in which we are involved. 
With regard to many firms in the financial services 

industry, the number of these investigations and 

proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and 
fines sought, has increased substantially in recent 
years. Further, we may become subject to regulatory 

scrutiny, inquiries or investigations, and potentially 

client-related inquiries or claims, relating to broad, 
industry-wide concerns that could lead to increased 
expenses or reputational damage. For example, many 
participants in the foreign exchange industry are 
currently receiving heightened regulatory scrutiny 
concerning alleged potential manipulation with 
respect to published foreign exchange benchmarks 
and we, like a number of others, have received 
inquiries from government authorities seeking 
information. Responding to inquiries, investigations, 

lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate 
outcome of the matter, is time-consuming and 

expensive and can divert the attention of our senior 
management from our business. The outcome of such 

proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate 

until late in the proceedings, which may last a number 
of years. Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform 
under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a 
duty perceived to be owed to them. This risk may be 

heightened during periods when credit, equity or 
other financial markets are deteriorating in value or 
are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors 
are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly 

held company, we are subject to the risk of claims 

under the federal securities laws, and volatility in our 
stock price increases this risk. Actions brought against us may result in lawsuits, enforcement actions, injunctions, settlements, 
damages, fines or penalties, which could have a 
material adverse effect on our financial condition or 

results of operations or require changes to our 
business. Claims for significant monetary damages 

are asserted in many of these legal actions, while 
claims for disgorgement, penalties and/or other 

remedial sanctions may be sought in regulatory 
matters. Although we establish accruals for our 

litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with 
applicable accounting guidance when those matters 
proceed to a stage where they present loss 
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably 
estimable, nonetheless there may be a possible 
material exposure to loss in excess of any amounts 
accrued. Any or all of these risks could result in 

increased regulatory supervision and affect our ability 

to attract and retain customers or maintain access to 
the capital markets. Adverse governmental scrutiny 

and legal proceedings can also adversely impact the 
morale and performance of our employees. Adverse publicity with respect to us, other well-known companies and the financial services 
industry generally could materially adversely affect 
 96 BNY Mellon 
(continued) our results of operations or harm our businesses or reputation. We are subject to reputational, legal and regulatory 
risk in the ordinary course of our business. The 2008 

financial crisis and current political and public 
sentiment regarding financial institutions have 
resulted in a significant amount of adverse media 
coverage of financial institutions. Harm to our 

reputation can result from numerous sources, 
including adverse publicity arising from events in the 
financial markets, our perceived failure to comply 
with legal and regulatory requirements, the purported 
actions of our employees or alleged financial 
reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other 
large and well-known companies.  Additionally, a 

failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and 
quality or a failure to appropriately describe our 
products and services can result in customer 
dissatisfaction, lost revenue, higher operating costs, 
heightened regulatory scrutiny and litigation. Actions 

by the financial services industry generally or by 
other members of or individuals in the financial 
services industry can also negatively impact our 
reputation. For example, public perception that some 

consumers may have been treated unfairly by 
financial institutions has damaged the reputation of 
the financial services industry as a whole. Should any 
of these or other events or factors that can undermine 
our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the 

additional costs and expenses that we may need to 
incur to address the issues giving rise to the 
reputational harm would not adversely affect our 

earnings and results of operations. Continued litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings involving our foreign exchange 
standing instruction program and resulting adverse 
publicity could affect our reputation and negatively 

impact our foreign exchange business. Beginning in 2009, our foreign exchange standing instruction program became the subject of litigation 
and regulatory investigations and proceedings. See 

ﬁLegal proceedingsﬂ in Note 22 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. These litigation and regulatory investigations 

and proceedings have generated substantial scrutiny 
of, and adverse publicity concerning, our foreign 
exchange standing instruction program. Continued 

litigation involving our foreign exchange standing 
instruction program, and the resulting scrutiny and 
adverse publicity, could affect our reputation and 
discourage clients from doing business with us. For 

example, these proceedings have resulted in the loss 
of Ohio public fund custody clients, which has 
attracted media attention and led to inquiries from 
other clients, investors and employees. If we 

continue to be subject to these proceedings and the 
resulting adverse publicity relating to our foreign 
exchange standing instruction program, our 
reputation could be further affected, adversely 

impacting our business and results of operations. See 

ﬁFee and other revenue - Foreign exchange and other 
trading revenueﬂ in the MD&A - Results of 

Operations section of this Annual Report for more 

information regarding our foreign exchange business, 
including business practices, results of operations and 
trends. Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ status or 
capital adequacy rules more generally, could result 

in limitations on our activities and adversely affect 

our business and financial condition. Under regulatory capital adequacy rules and other regulatory requirements, BNY Mellon and our 

subsidiary banks must meet thresholds that include 
quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain 
off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative 

judgments by regulators about components, risk 
weightings and other factors. As discussed under 

ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ in this Annual Report, 

BNY Mellon is regulated as a BHC and a financial 

holding company (ﬁFHCﬂ). Our ability to maintain 

our status as an FHC is dependent upon a number of 
factors, including our U.S. depository institution 
subsidiaries qualifying on an ongoing basis as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under the banking 
agencies™ prompt corrective action regulations and 

upon BNY Mellon qualifying on an ongoing basis as 

ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ under 
applicable Federal Reserve regulations. Failure by 

BNY Mellon or one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to 

qualify as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ and ﬁwell managedﬂ, if 
unremedied over a period of time, would cause us to 
lose our status as an FHC and could affect the 

confidence of clients in us, compromising our 
competitive position. Additionally, an FHC that does 

not continue to meet all the requirements for FHC 
status could lose the ability to undertake new 
activities or make acquisitions that are not generally 
permissible for BHCs without FHC status or to 
continue such activities. BNY Mellon 97 
 (continued)Our bank subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements, administered by the Federal Reserve in 
the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the 

OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, 
BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York 

Mellon Trust Company, National Association.  

Failure by one of our bank subsidiaries to maintain its 
status as ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ could lead to, among 
other things, higher FDIC assessments. A further 

failure by BNY Mellon or one of our U.S. bank 

subsidiaries to maintain its status as ﬁadequately 
capitalizedﬂ would lead to regulatory sanctions and 
limitations and could lead the federal banking 
agencies to take ﬁprompt corrective action.ﬂ The Federal Reserve has set a minimum leverage ratio of at least 3% or 4% for BHCs (depending on 
factors specified in regulations), including BNY 
Mellon, and requires The Bank of New York Mellon 

to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 5% to maintain 
its ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ status. The leverage ratio 

measures the ratio of Basel I Tier 1 capital to 

quarterly average assets, as defined under Basel I 
regulatory guidelines. As part of the Final Capital Rules, BNY Mellon will 
be required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
4%, and The Bank of New York Mellon will be 

required to maintain a leverage ratio of 5% to 
maintain its ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ status.€In addition to 

this traditional total leverage constraint, the Final 
Capital Rules will require an additional 
supplementary leverage ratio with a minimum of 3%, 
to become effective Jan. 1, 2018.  The supplementary 

leverage ratio measures Tier 1 capital against an 

organization™s total leverage exposure, which 

includes not only a firm™s total assets but also many 

off-balance sheet exposures.  On July 9, 2013, the 

U.S. banking agencies proposed revisions to the 
supplementary leverage ratio under a notice of 
proposed rulemaking that would only apply to the 
largest U.S. BHCs and banks, including BNY Mellon.  

The July 9 proposal would increase the 
supplementary leverage requirement for affected 

holding companies to 5%. In addition, this proposal 

would establish a supplementary leverage ratio ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ threshold of 6% for affected insured 

depository institutions under the U.S. banking 
agencies™ prompt corrective action framework, 

including our largest banking subsidiary, The Bank of 

New York Mellon.€ Separately, in January of 2014 the 

Basel Committee adopted amendments to its 
supplementary leverage ratio™s exposure measure 
principally concerning securities financing 
transactions, off-balance sheet credit conversion 

factors, the treatment of cash variation margin, central 

clearing, and written credit derivatives. If our company or our subsidiary banks failed to meet these minimum capital rules and other regulatory 
requirements, we may not be able to deploy capital in 
the operation of our business or distribute capital to 
stockholders, which may adversely affect our 

business. If we are not able to meet the Final Capital 

Rules™ additional, more stringent, capital adequacy 

standards, we may not remain ﬁwell capitalized.ﬂ See 

ﬁSupervision and Regulationﬂ and the ﬁLiquidity and 
dividendsﬂ and ﬁCapital - Capital adequacyﬂ sections 
in the MD&A - Results of Operations section in this 

Annual Report. Our business may be materially adversely affected 
by operational risk. We are exposed to operational risk as a result of 
conducting various fee-based services in our 
Investment Services and Investment Management 
businesses. Examples of operational risk include: the 

risk of loss resulting from errors related to transaction 
processing; breaches of the internal control system 
and compliance requirements; fraud by employees or 
persons outside BNY Mellon; business interruption 

due to system failures; unsuccessful or difficult 

implementation of computer systems upgrades; 
natural disasters or other events; or other risk of loss 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems or from external events. 
Operational risk may also include breaches of our 
technology and information systems resulting from 
unauthorized access to confidential information or 
from internal or external threats, such as cyber 
attacks. Operational risk also includes potential legal 

or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of 
non-compliance with applicable laws, regulatory 
requirements or contracts which could have an 
adverse effect on our reputation and could result in 

the imposition of fines or civil money penalties or the 
payment of damages. Further, national regulators in 

the UK and Ireland continue to focus on rules around 
the protection of client assets, with consultative 
exercises being conducted by the FCA in the UK with 

regard to the UK CASS regime and by the Irish 
Central Bank with regard to implementation of a new 
regime in Ireland. We continue to assess our 

operational models and risks in light of these 
regulatory priorities.  98 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to 

fully understand the implications of changes in our 
businesses or the financial markets or fail to 
adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to 
address those changes. If our risk framework is 

ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with 

changes in the financial markets, regulatory 
requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, 
clients or service providers or for other reasons, we 
could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find 

ourselves out of compliance with applicable 
regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. We use various risk models in analyzing and 
monitoring many risk categories. However, these 

models, processes and strategies are inherently 
limited because they involve techniques, including 
the use of historical data in some circumstances, and 
judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and 
financial outcome in the markets in which we 
operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and 
timing of such outcomes. An important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully 
understand that there is risk in every aspect of our 
business and the importance of managing risk as it 
relates to their job functions. We continue to enhance 

our risk management program to support our risk 
culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate 
to our role as a major financial institution. 
Nonetheless, if we fail to create the appropriate 
environment that sensitizes all of our employees to 
managing risk, our business could be adversely 
impacted. We regularly assess and monitor 

operational risk in our business and provide for 
disaster and business recovery planning, including 
geographical diversification of our facilities. 
However, despite our efforts to assess and monitor 

operational risk, our risk management program may 
not be effective in all cases.  The occurrence of 

various events, including unforeseeable and 
unpreventable events, such as systems failures or 
natural disasters, could damage our physical facilities 
or our computer systems or software, cause delay or 
disruptions to operational functions, impair our 
clients, vendors and counterparties and ultimately 
negatively impact our results of operations due to 
potentially higher expenses and lower revenues. 
When we record balance sheet reserves for probable 
and estimable loss contingencies related to 
operational losses (or when we disclose a range of reasonably possible loss for reasonably possible and 
estimable loss contingencies), our estimated exposure 
may not be sufficient to cover our actual exposure, 

which could have a material adverse effect on our 

consolidated results of operations in the period in 
which such actions or matters are resolved. For a 

discussion of operational risk see ﬁRisk Management 
-Operational/business riskﬂ and ﬁBusiness Continuityﬂ in the MD&A section in this Annual 

Report. A failure or circumvention of our controls and 
procedures could have a material adverse effect on 

our business, results of operations and financial 
condition. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, 
and corporate governance policies and procedures. 
Any system of controls, however well designed and 
operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances 
that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure 

or circumvention of our controls and procedures or 
failure to comply with regulations related to controls 
and procedures could have a material adverse effect 

on our business, results of operations and financial 
condition. If we identify material weaknesses in our 

internal control over financial reporting or are 
otherwise required to restate our financial statements, 
we could be required to implement other expensive 
and time-consuming remedial measures and could 
lose investor confidence in the accuracy and 
completeness of our financial reports. In addition, 

there are risks that individuals, either employees or 
contractors, consciously circumvent established 
control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding 

trading or investment management limitations, or 
committing fraud. If our information systems experience a disruption or breach in security that results in a loss of 
confidential client information or impacts our 
ability to provide services to our clients, our 
business and results of operations may be adversely 
affected. 
We rely on communications and information systems 
to conduct our business. Our businesses that rely 

heavily on technology, including our Investment 

Services business, are particularly vulnerable to 
security breaches and technology disruptions. While 

our information systems have been subjected to cyber BNY Mellon 99 
 (continued)threats, including hacker attacks, computer viruses or other malicious code, denial of service efforts, limited 

unavailability of service, phishing attacks, and 
unauthorized access attempts, we deploy a broad 
range of sophisticated defenses and we have avoided 
a material breach, but notwithstanding these efforts, it 

is possible we could suffer a material breach or 

disruption in the future. The security of our computer 

systems, software and networks, and those functions 
that we may outsource, may continue to be subjected 
to cyber threats that could result in failures or 
disruptions in our business. Despite our efforts to 

ensure the integrity of our systems and information, it 
is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to 
implement effective preventive measures against all 

cyber threats, especially because the techniques used 
change frequently or are not recognized until 
launched, and because security attacks can originate 
from a wide variety of sources, including outside 
third parties such as persons who are involved with 
organized crime or associated with external service 

providers or who may be linked to terrorist 
organizations or hostile foreign governments.  Those 

parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce 
employees, customers or other users of our systems to 
disclose sensitive information in order to gain access 
to our data or that of our customers or clients. Breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or 
unauthorized access to our systems or our clients™ or 

counterparties™ confidential information, including 

employees and customers, as well as hackers. A 

breach of security that results in the loss of 
confidential client information may require us to 
reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and 
credit monitoring efforts, may result in loss of 

customer business, or damage to our computers or 
systems and those of our customers and 
counterparties, would be costly and time-consuming, 
and may negatively impact our results of operations 
and reputation. Additionally, security breaches or 

disruptions of our information systems, or those of 
our service providers, could impact our ability to 
provide services to our clients, which could expose us 
to liability for damages which may not be covered by 
insurance, result in the loss of customer business, 
damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory 
scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation, any of which 
could have a material adverse effect on our financial 

condition and results of operations. In addition, the 

failure to upgrade or maintain our computer systems, 
software and networks, as necessary, could also make 
us susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access 
and misuse. There can be no assurance that any such 

failures, interruptions or security breaches will not 
occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately 

addressed. We may be required to expend significant 

additional resources to modify, investigate or 

remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising 
from information systems security risks. 
Furthermore, even if not directed at us specifically, 

attacks on other large financial institutions could 

disrupt the overall functioning of the financial system 
to the detriment of other financial institutions, 
including us. As a result of the importance of communications and information systems to our business, we could also be 
adversely affected if attacks affecting the third party 

providers of our communications services impair our 
ability to process transactions and communicate with 
customers and counterparties. For a discussion of 

operational risk, see ﬁRisk Management -
Operational/business riskﬂ and ﬁBusiness Continuityﬂ 
in the MD&A section in this Annual Report. 
We depend on our technology; if we fail to update 
our technology our business may be adversely 
affected. 
We are dependent on technology because many of our 
products and services involve processing large 

volumes of data. Our technology platforms must 

therefore provide global capabilities and scale. Rapid 

technological changes, together with competitive 
pressures, require significant and ongoing 
investments in technology to develop competitive 
new products and services or adopt new technologies. 
Technological advances which result in lower 

transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues. 
In addition, unsuccessful implementation of 
technological upgrades and new products may 
adversely impact our ability to service and retain 
customers. We cannot provide any assurance that our 

technology spending will achieve gains in 
competitiveness or profitability, and the costs we 

incur in product development could be substantial. 
Accordingly, we could incur substantial development 

costs without achieving corresponding gains in 
profitability. 
Developments in the securities processing industry, 

through-processing, will necessitate ongoing changes 
to our business and operations and will likely require  100 BNY Mellon 
(continued) additional investment in technology.  Our financial 
performance depends in part on our ability to develop 
and market new and innovative services, to adopt or 
develop new technologies that differentiate our 

products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver 

these products and services to the market in a timely 
manner at a competitive price. Additionally, failure 

to ensure adequate review and consideration of 
critical business changes prior to and during 
introduction and deployment of key technological 
systems or failure to adequately align evolving client 
commitments and expectations with operational 
capabilities can have a negative impact on our 
operations. We rely on a variety of measures to protect our 
intellectual property and proprietary information, 
including copyrights, trademarks, patents and 
controls on access and distribution. These measures 

may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of 
our intellectual property or proprietary information 
and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. 
Furthermore, if a third party were to assert a claim of 
infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary 
rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against 
us with respect to one or more of our products, 
systems, or methods of doing business or conducting 
our operations, we could be required to spend 
significant amounts to defend such claims, develop 
alternative methods of operations, pay substantial 
money damages or obtain a license from the third 
party. 
Change or uncertainty in monetary, tax and other 
governmental policies may impact our profitability 
and ability to compete. The monetary, tax and other policies of the 
government and its agencies, including the Federal 
Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates 
and overall financial market performance. The 

Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and 
credit in the United States and its policies influence 
our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital 
raising activities and the return we earn on those 
loans and investments, both of which affect our net 

interest margin.  For example, the Federal Reserve™s 

low interest rate policies have resulted in, and could 
continue to result in, some reduction in our spread-
based income and net interest revenue. The actions 

of the Federal Reserve also can materially affect the 

value of financial instruments we hold, and its 
policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their 
loans. Our business and earnings may also be adversely affected by the monetary, tax and other governmental 

policies that are adopted by various regulatory 
authorities, governments and international agencies. 
As a result of the 2008 financial crisis, there have 
been significant changes in these policies, which have 
imposed additional compliance, legal, review and 
response costs that have impacted our profitability.  

Changes in monetary, tax and other governmental 

policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to 

predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect 

that any such changes would have upon our business, 
financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to intense competition in all aspects 
of our business, which could negatively affect our 

ability to maintain or increase our profitability. 
Many businesses in which we operate are intensely competitive around the world. Competitors include 

other banks, trading firms, broker dealers, investment 
banks, asset managers, insurance companies and a 
variety of other financial services and advisory 
companies whose products and services span the 
local, national and global markets in which we 
conduct operations. In addition, technological 

advances and the growth of internet-based commerce 
have made it possible for other types of institutions, 
such as outsourcing companies and data processing 
companies, to offer a variety of products and services 

competitive with certain areas of our business. 
Increased competition in any one or all of these areas 
may require us to make additional capital investments 
in our businesses in order to remain competitive. Furthermore, pricing pressures, as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or 

improved products or services at a lower price, may 
result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our 

products and services, which could negatively affect 

our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. 
Recently implemented and proposed regulations may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses 
in a cost-effective manner or at all.  See ﬁSupervision 

and Regulationﬂ in this Annual Report.  These 

regulations may not apply to all of our competitors, 
which could adversely impact our ability to compete 
effectively.  A decline in our competitive position 
BNY Mellon 101 
(continued)could adversely affect our ability to maintain or 
increase our profitability. 
New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks, and the failure to 
grow our existing businesses could affect our results 

of operations. From time to time, we may launch new lines of business or offer new products and services within 

existing lines of business. There are substantial risks 

and uncertainties associated with these efforts.  We 

invest significant time and resources in developing 
and marketing new lines of business, products and 
services. Initial timetables for the introduction and 

development of new lines of business and/or new 
products or services may not be achieved and price 
and profitability targets may not be met.  Our 

revenues and costs may fluctuate because generally 

up costs while revenues may take time to develop, 
which may adversely impact our results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected if we are 
unable to attract and retain employees. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to 
attract new employees, retain and motivate our 
existing employees, and continue to compensate our 
employees competitively amid intense public and 
regulatory scrutiny of the compensation practices of 
large financial institutions.  Competition for the best 

employees in most activities in which we engage can 
be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will 
be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key 

personnel. Factors that affect our ability to attract 

and retain talented and diverse employees include our 
compensation and benefits programs, our profitability 
and our reputation for rewarding and promoting 
qualified employees. Our ability to attract and retain 

key executives and other employees may be hindered 
as a result of regulations applicable to incentive 
compensation and other aspects of our compensation 
programs promulgated by the Federal Reserve and 
other regulators in the United States and worldwide, 
regulations on incentive compensation promulgated 
by various U.S. regulators pursuant to the Dodd-
Frank Act and other existing and potential 

regulations. These regulations, which include and are 

expected to include mandatory deferral and clawback 
requirements, may not apply to some of our 
competitors and to other institutions with which we 
compete for talent. Our ability to recruit and retain 
key talent may be adversely affected by these 

regulations. In addition, aspects of our compensation 

programs are performance-based. If we do not 

achieve applicable performance thresholds for a 
relevant period, employee compensation may be 
adversely affected. 
We are subject to political, economic, legal, 
operational and other risks that are inherent in 
operating globally and which may adversely affect 

our business. In conducting our business and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to 
risks of loss from the outbreak of hostilities and 
various unfavorable political, economic, legal or 
other developments, including social or political 
instability, changes in governmental policies or 

policies of central banks, expropriation, 
nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, 
capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax 
rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and 
regulations. Our international clients accounted for 

37% of our revenue in 2013. Our non-U.S. 

businesses are subject to extensive regulation by 
various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, 
securities exchanges, central banks and other 
regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those 
businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and 

regulations applicable to the financial services 
industry are uncertain and evolving, and may be 
applied with extra scrutiny to non-domestic 
companies, and it may be difficult for us to determine 

the exact requirements of local laws in every market 
or manage our relationships with multiple regulators 
in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in 

compliance with local laws in a particular market and 
manage our relationships with regulators could have 
an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that 

market but also on our reputation generally. 
The failure to properly mitigate such risks, or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such 
international activities could result in operational 
failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which 
could adversely affect our business and results of 

operations. In addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal 
payments and money laundering, as well as laws 
relating to doing business with certain individuals, 
groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign  102 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the 
Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 

2012 and the UK Bribery Act.  While we have 

invested and continue to invest significant resources 
in training and in compliance monitoring, the 
geographical diversity of our operations, employees, 
clients and customers, as well as the vendors and 
other third parties that we deal with, presents the risk 
that we may be found in violation of such rules, 
regulations or laws and any such violation could 
subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect 

our reputation. Further, our businesses and operations from time to 
time enter into new regions throughout the world, 
including emerging and frontier markets.  Various 

emerging and frontier market countries have 

experienced severe economic and financial 
disruptions, including significant devaluations of their 
currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on 
sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange 
controls, and low or negative growth rates in their 
economies. Crime, corruption, war or military 

actions, and a lack of an established legal and 
regulatory framework are additional challenges in 
certain emerging and frontier markets.  Revenue from 

international operations and trading in non-U.S. 
securities and other obligations may be subject to 
negative fluctuations as a result of the above 
considerations. The possible effects of any of these 

conditions may adversely affect our business and 

results of operations. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our 
business and operations. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could 
have a negative impact on our business and 
operations. While we have in place business 

continuity and disaster recovery plans, such events 
could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the 
normal operations of our business (including 
communications and technology), result in harm or 
cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a 
similar impact on our clients, suppliers and 
counterparties. These events could also negatively 

impact the purchase of our products and services to 
the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced 
capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or 

disruptions in general economic activity in the United 
States or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. For example, in October 2012 several of 

our facilities in the northeastern U.S. were impacted 
by Superstorm Sandy and the New York Stock 

Exchange was closed for two trading days. While our 

business continuity plans functioned well and we did 
not experience a material financial impact from the 
storm, nonetheless the recovery required significant 
resources and we experienced some lost revenue 
opportunities. In addition, war, terror attacks, 

political unrest, global conflicts, the national and 
global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential 

military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may 
negatively impact economic growth, which could 
have an adverse effect on our business and 

operations, and may have other adverse effects on us 

in ways that we are unable to predict. Our strategic acquisitions, including our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and 
potential liabilities from legacy claims against the 
acquired businesses, present risks and uncertainties 
and could have an adverse effect on our business, 

results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives, we have acquired or invested in other companies or 
businesses, and may do so in the future. Each 

acquisition poses integration challenges, including 
successfully retaining and assimilating clients and 
key employees, capitalizing on certain revenue 
synergies, integrating the acquired company™s 

accounting management information, internal 
controls and other administrative systems and 
technology.  We may be required to spend a 

significant amount of time and resources to integrate 
these acquisitions and the anticipated benefits may 
take longer to achieve than projected. Additionally, 

for a period of time after an acquisition we may be 
required to use legacy technology systems until we 
are able to convert the acquired business to desired 
technology systems. In the event that such 

technology conversion takes longer than anticipated, 
we may incur significant costs for the continued 
usage of legacy technology, operational and cost 

inefficiencies and client dissatisfaction resulting from 

the use of multiple technology systems. If we fail to 

successfully integrate strategic acquisitions, including 
doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner, we 

may not realize the expected benefits regarding such 
acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on 
our business, financial condition and results of 
operations. In addition, we may incur expenses, 

costs, losses, and other liabilities in connection with BNY Mellon 103 
(continued)the defense and/or settlement of legal and regulatory claims, investigations and proceedings related to 
actions or omissions of the acquired businesses prior 
to the date of our ownership. Moreover, to the extent 

we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, 

there can be no guarantee that the transaction will 
close when anticipated, or at all. In particular, in 

certain instances we or the purchaser must seek 
regulatory approvals, which can delay or disrupt such 
acquisitions or dispositions. Market Risk 
Ongoing concerns about the financial stability of several countries in Europe, the failure or instability 
of any of our significant counterparties in Europe, 
or a breakup of the European Monetary Union 
could have a material adverse effect on our business 

and results of operations. Despite improved financial market conditions, there remain ongoing concerns about the ability of certain 
European countries, particularly Greece, Ireland and 
Portugal, but also others such as Spain and Italy, to 

finance their deficits and service growing debt 
burdens. This loss of confidence has led to rescue 

measures for Greece, Ireland and Portugal by 
Eurozone countries and the International Monetary 
Fund as well as the newly established European 
Stability Mechanism and the European Central 
Bank™s Outright Monetary Transactions program to 

stabilize Eurozone governments. Yields on 

government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, 
including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, 

have stabilized; however, it remains to be seen 

whether this stability is sustainable. The actions 

required to be taken by those countries as a condition 
to rescue packages, and by other countries to mitigate 
similar developments in their economies, have 
resulted in increased political discord within and 
among Eurozone countries. In addition, while the 

finance ministers of the Eurozone countries agreed to 
a common bank resolution regime and fund for 
failing banks in December 2013, the proposal must be 
approved, and could be amended, by the European 
Parliament, and certain details of the proposal have 
not been determined. We are primarily exposed to 

disruptions in European markets in three principal 
areas - on our balance sheet, in certain interest 
bearing deposits with banks, loans, trading assets and 
investment securities, as well as our Investment 
Management and Investment Services fee revenue. 
Additionally, continued disruptions in Europe could 
lead to increased client deposits and a larger balance 

sheet, which could adversely impact our leverage 
ratio. For additional information regarding our 

exposure, please see ﬁInternational Operations -
Exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and 

Greeceﬂ in the MD&A - Results of operations section 

in this Annual Report. 
The partial or full break-up of the European Monetary Union would be unprecedented and its impact highly 
uncertain. The exit of one or more countries from the 

European Monetary Union or the dissolution of the 
European Monetary Union could lead to 
redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in 
exiting countries. Any such exit and redenomination 

would cause significant uncertainty with respect to 
outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors 
in any exiting country, whether sovereign or 

otherwise, and lead to complex and lengthy disputes 
and litigation. The resulting uncertainty and market 

stress could also cause, among other things, severe 
disruption to equity markets, significant increases in 
bond yields generally, potential failure or default of 

financial institutions, including those of systemic 
importance, a significant decrease in global liquidity, 

a freeze-up of global credit markets and a potential 
worldwide recession. The interdependencies among European economies and financial institutions have contributed to concerns 
regarding the stability of European financial markets 
generally and certain institutions in particular.  

Financial services institutions are interdependent as a 
result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other 
relationships. We routinely execute transactions with 

European counterparties, including brokers and 
dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual 
and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a 

result, defaults or non-performance by, or even 

rumors or questions about, one or more European 
financial institutions, or the financial markets 
generally, have in the past led to market-wide 

liquidity problems and could lead to losses by us or 
by other institutions in the future. Given the scope of 

our European operations, clients and counterparties, 
persistent disruptions in the European financial 
markets, the attempt of a country to abandon the 
Euro, the failure of a significant European financial 
institution, even if not an immediate counterparty to 
us, or persistent weakness in the Euro could have a 
material adverse impact on our business or results of 
operations.  104 BNY Mellon

(continued)Low or volatile interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. 
Our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and changes in 
valuations in the debt or equity markets over which 
we have no control. Our net interest revenue is the 

difference between the interest income earned on our 

interest-earning assets, such as the loans we make and 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and 
the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing 
liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed money. 
The global market crisis triggered a series of cuts in interest rates and the tentative recovery has kept U.S. 
short-term rates low, although long-term rates have 

started to rise. A continuing low short-term rate 

environment will further compress our net interest 
spreads, reduce our spread-based revenues and result 
in continued voluntary waiving of fees on certain 
money market mutual funds and related distribution 
fees by us and others in order to prevent the yields on 
such funds from becoming uneconomic, which has an 
adverse impact on our revenue and results of 
operations. In addition, while a rise in long-term rates can improve investment yields as we deploy assets, our 
largely fixed-income securities portfolio is sensitive 

to a rise in long-term rates, which would reduce other 
comprehensive income in our shareholders™ equity, 

thereby affecting our tangible common equity.  For 

example, the rise in long-term interest rates in the 
second half of 2013 triggered a decline in the 
valuation of our securities portfolio and a reduction in 
the related unrealized gain of our investment 
securities. Changes in interest rates could trigger one or more of the following, which could impact our business, 
results of operations and financial condition, 
including: Ł net interest revenue, depending on our balance sheet position at the time of change. See the 
discussion under ﬁAsset/liability managementﬂ in 
the MD&A - Results of Operations section in this 

Annual Report; Ł increased number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults and more nonperforming assets and 
net charge-offs; 
Ł changes in deposit levels; and Ł funding costs. A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and 

market risks we face is contained under ﬁRisk 
Managementﬂ in the MD&A section in this Annual 

Report. Market volatility may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and 
our ability to manage risk. As a financial institution, we are particularly sensitive to the capital and credit markets. When these markets 

are volatile or disruptive, we could experience a 
decline in our marked-to-market assets, including our 
securities portfolio, trading book and equity 
investments. A market downturn could also cause a 

decline in the value of the assets that we manage, 
hold in custody or administer, adversely impacting 

fee revenue and certain of our capital ratios. In 

addition, market volatility could produce downward 
pressure on our stock price and credit availability 
without regard to our underlying financial strength. 
If the market price of our common stock were to 
decline, we could be required to perform goodwill 
impairment testing. While a substantial goodwill 

impairment charge would not have a significant 

impact on our financial condition, it would have an 
adverse impact on our results of operations. For a 

discussion of goodwill, see ﬁCritical accounting 
estimates - Goodwill and other intangiblesﬂ in the 
MD&A - Results of Operations section in this Annual 

Report. A significant market downturn could 

materially adversely impact our business, financial 
condition, results of operations and ability to manage 
risk. For a discussion of our management of market 

risk, see ﬁRisk Management-Market riskﬂ in the 
MD&A section in this Annual Report. 
We may experience further write-downs of financial 
instruments that we own and other losses related to 
volatile and illiquid market conditions, reducing our 
earnings. We maintain an investment securities portfolio of 
various holdings, types and maturities. These 

securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale 

and, consequently, are recorded on our balance sheet 

at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported 
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive 
income, net of tax. Our portfolio includes U.S. 
 106 BNY Mellon 
(continued) Agency RMBS, U.S. Treasuries, sovereign and 
sovereign-guaranteed debt, non-agency U.S. and non-
U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities, 
European floating rate notes, commercial mortgage-
backed securities, state and political subdivisions, 
foreign covered bonds, corporate bonds, 
collateralized loan obligations, U.S. government 
agency debt, consumer asset-backed securities and 
other securities, the values of which are subject to 
market price volatility to the extent unhedged. Our 

investment securities portfolio represented 
approximately 26% of our consolidated total assets as 
of Dec. 31, 2013. As such, our capital levels and 

consolidated results of operations and financial 
condition are materially exposed to the risks 
associated with our investment portfolio. In addition, 
if such investments suffer credit losses, as we 

experienced with some of our investments in 2009, 
we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an 
other-than-temporary impairment which could impact 

our revenue in the quarter in which we recognize the 
losses. For example, net securities losses totaled $4.8 

billion in the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a 
result of a charge related to restructuring the 

investment securities portfolio, which resulted in 
negative earnings per share that quarter.  The losses in 

2009 reflected both credit- and non-credit-related 
losses on our investment securities portfolio. We 

could experience losses related to our investment 
securities portfolio in the future, which could 
ultimately adversely affect our results of operations 

and capital levels. For information regarding our 

investment securities portfolio, refer to ﬁConsolidated 
balance sheet review - Investment securitiesﬂ and for 
information regarding the sensitivity of and risks 
associated with the market value of portfolio 
investments and interest rates, refer to the ﬁCritical 

Other-than-temporary impairmentﬂ sections both of 

which are in the MD&A - Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report and Note 4 of the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. We are dependent on fee-based business for a 
substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-
based revenues could be adversely affected by a 

slowing in capital market activity, weak financial 

markets or negative trends in savings rates or in 
individual investment preferences. Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from 
loans and other traditional interest-generating 
products and services. Our fee-based businesses 

include investment management, custody, corporate 

trust, depositary receipts, clearing, collateral 
management and treasury services. Fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed, the market 
value of assets managed and administered, securities 
lending volume and spreads, and fees for other 
services rendered. Corporate actions, cross-border 

investing, global mergers and acquisitions activity, 

new debt and equity issuances, and secondary trading 
volumes all affect the level of our revenues.  If the 

volumes of these activities decrease, our revenues 
will also decrease, which would negatively impact 
our results of operations. In addition, weak financial markets could result in reduced market values in some of the assets that we 
manage and administer and result in a corresponding 
decrease in the amount of fees we receive and 
therefore would have an adverse effect on our results 

of operations. Similarly, significant declines in the 

volume of capital markets activity would reduce the 
number of transactions we process and the amount of 
securities lending we do and therefore would also 
have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Our business generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other 
collective funds, in defined benefit plans, unit 
investment trusts or exchange traded funds. If there 

is a decline in the savings rates of individuals, or if 
there is a change in investment preferences that leads 
to less investment in mutual funds, other collective 
funds, defined benefit plans or defined contribution 
plans, our revenues could be adversely affected. 
Our foreign exchange revenues may be adversely affected by a stable exchange-rate environment or 

decreased cross-border investing activity. 
The degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading 

revenue. Most of our foreign exchange revenue is 

derived from our securities servicing client base. 
Activity levels and spreads are generally higher when 
there is more volatility.  Accordingly, our foreign 

exchange revenue benefits from currency volatility 
and is likely to decrease during times of decreased 
currency volatility.  However, increased volatility in 
BNY Mellon 107 
    (continued)foreign exchange rates tends to increase our market risk, which particularly impacts our exposures that 
are marked-to-market, such as the securities portfolio, 
trading book, and equity investments. In addition, our future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or 
decreases in cross-border or other investments made 
by our clients. Economic and political uncertainties 

resulting from terrorist attacks, military actions or 
other events, including changes in laws or regulations 
governing cross-border transactions, such as currency 
controls, could result in decreased cross-border 
investment activity. 
Credit and Liquidity Risk 
Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries, The Bank of New 
York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., could increase 

the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our 
rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect 

on our results of operations and financial condition 
and on the value of the securities we issue. Our debt, preferred stock and trust preferred securities and the debt and deposits of our 
subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A., are currently rated investment grade by 
the major rating agencies. These rating agencies 

regularly evaluate us and our rated subsidiaries and 
their outlook on us and our rated subsidiaries. Their 

credit ratings are based on a number of factors, 
including our financial strength, as well as factors not 
entirely within our control, including conditions 
affecting the financial services industry generally as 

well as the U.S. Government. In addition, rating 

agencies employ different models and formulas to 

assess the financial strength of a rated company, and 

from time to time rating agencies have, in their 
discretion, altered these models. Changes to rating 

agency models, general economic conditions, or other 
circumstances outside of our control could impact a 
rating agency™s judgment of the rating or outlook it 

assigns us or our rated subsidiaries. In view of the 

difficulties experienced in recent years by many 

financial institutions, we believe that the rating 
agencies have heightened their level of scrutiny, 

increased the frequency and scope of their credit 
reviews, have requested additional information, and 
have adjusted upward the requirements employed in 
their models for maintenance of rating levels. For 

example, on Nov. 14, 2013, Moody™s concluded its 
previously announced reviews of the three large U.S. 

trust and custody banks™ long-term ratings.  As a 

result of these reviews, which included both U.S. 
government support ratings, and stand-alone ratings, 
Moody™s downgraded our ratings and those of The 

Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. by 

one notch. Our short-term ratings and those of The 

Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. 

were unchanged. The ratings of the other two large 

U.S. trust and custody banks were also downgraded. Moreover, in June 2013, S&P indicated that it is 
reconsidering its inclusion of assumed government 
support in the ratings of eight U.S. bank holding 
companies that they view as having high systemic 
importance, including us. Currently, as a result of 

these government support assumptions, our ratings 
and those of The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A. benefit from one notch of ﬁliftﬂ from 
S&P and The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY 

Mellon, N.A. benefit from two notches of ﬁliftﬂ from 
Moody™s.  S&P continues to evaluate whether to 

reduce its support assumptions to below pre-financial 
crisis levels for banks that currently benefit from 
ratings uplift. There can be no assurance that we or 

our rated subsidiaries will maintain our respective 
credit ratings or outlook on our securities. A material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit 
ratings of our rated subsidiaries could have a material 
adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the 

related cost of funding and borrowing, our credit 
spreads, our liquidity and on certain trading revenues, 
particularly in those businesses where counterparty 
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, in connection 

with certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts 

and other trading agreements, counterparties may 
require us to provide additional collateral or to 
terminate these contracts and agreements and 
collateral financing arrangements in the event of a 
credit ratings downgrade below certain ratings levels. 
The requirement to provide additional collateral or 
terminate these contracts and agreements could 
impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other 
sources of financing or to make significant cash 
payments or securities movements. If a rating agency 

downgrade were to occur during broader market 
instability, our options for responding to events may 

be more limited and more expensive. An increase in 

the costs of our funding and borrowing, or an 
impairment of our liquidity, could have a material 

adverse effect on our results of operations and 

financial condition. A material reduction in our credit 
 108 BNY Mellon 
(continued) ratings also could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted to do business 
with or lend to us and adversely affect the value of 

the securities we have issued or may issue in the 
future. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may 
take, or what actions we may elect or be required to 
take in response thereto, which may adversely affect 

us. For further discussion on the impact of a credit 

rating downgrade, see ﬁDisclosure of contingent 
features in over-the-counter (ﬁOTCﬂ) derivative 

instrumentsﬂ in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 
The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties, many of whom are major financial 
institutions and sovereign entities, and our 
assumption of credit and counterparty risk, could 
expose us to loss and adversely affect our business. 
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and 

commercial soundness of other financial institutions. 
Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of 
trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. 
We have exposure to many different industries and 

counterparties, particularly financial institutions, and 
we routinely execute transactions with counterparties 
in the financial industry, including brokers and 

dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual 
and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a 

result, defaults or non-performance by, or even 

rumors or questions about, one or more financial 
institutions, or the financial services industry 
generally, have in the past led to market-wide 

liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults 
by us or by other institutions in the future. For 

example, as a result of our membership in several 
industry clearing or settlement exchanges, we may be 
required to guarantee obligations and liabilities or 
provide financial support in the event that other 
members do not honor their obligations or default. 
These obligations may be limited to members who 
dealt with the defaulting member or to the amount (or 
a multiple of the amount) of our contribution to a 
member™s guarantee fund, or, in a few cases, the 

obligation may be unlimited. The consolidation of 

financial institutions in recent years and the failures 
of other financial institutions have increased the 
concentration of our counterparty risk. Under 

evolving regulatory restrictions on credit exposure, 
which are anticipated to include a broadening of the measure of credit exposure, we may be required to 
limit our exposures to specific counterparties or 
groups, including financial institutions and sovereign 
entities, to levels that we may currently exceed. The 

credit exposure restrictions under such evolving 
regulations may adversely affect our businesses and 

may require that we modify our operating models or 
our balance sheet management policies and practices. The degree of client demand for short-term credit also tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, 
exposing us to further counterparty-related risks. For 

example, investors in collective investment vehicles 
for which we act as custodian may engage in 
significant redemption activity due to adverse market 
or economic news that was not anticipated by the 
fund™s manager.  Our relationship with our clients, the 

nature of the settlement process and our systems may 
result in our extension of short-term credit in such 
circumstances. For some types of clients, we provide 

credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, 
which may expose us to potential loss if the client 
experiences credit difficulties.  In addition to our 

exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to 
time exposed to concentrated credit risk at the 
industry or country level, potentially exposing us to a 
single market or political event or a correlated set of 
events. As a consequence, we may incur a loss in 

relation to one entity or product even though our 
exposure to one of its affiliates or across product 

types is over-collateralized.  Moreover, not all of our 

counterparty exposure is secured and, when our 
exposure is secured, the realizable market value of 
the collateral may have declined by the time we 
exercise rights against that collateral. This risk may 

be particularly acute if we are required to sell the 
collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired 
market. In addition, disputes with counterparties as 

to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in 
times of market stress and illiquidity. 
We act as lender™s agent in securities lending 
transactions between our customers, acting as lenders, 
and financial counterparties, including broker-dealers, 

acting as borrowers, wherein securities are lent by our 
customers and the loans are secured by a pledge of 
cash or securities posted by such financial 
counterparties. Typically, in the case of cash 

collateral, we invest the cash collateral pursuant to 
each customer™s investment guidelines and 

instructions. In certain cases, we agree to indemnify 

our customers against a default by the borrower under 
a securities lending transaction and, therefore, may BNY Mellon 109 
  (continued)have to buy-in the loaned securities with the cash collateral or the proceeds from the liquidation of the 
non-cash collateral. In those instances, we, rather 

than our customers, are exposed to the risks of the 
defaulting counterparty on the securities lending 
transaction. Although our overall business is subject to these interdependencies, several of our businesses are 
particularly sensitive to them, including our currency 
and other trading activities, our securities lending and 
tri-party repo businesses and our investment 
management business. There is no assurance that any 

such losses would not materially and adversely affect 

our results of operations. We have credit, regulatory and reputation risks as a 
result of our tri-party repo collateral agency 
services, which could adversely affect our business 

and results of operations. BNY Mellon offers tri-party collateral agency 
services to dealers and cash investors active in the 
repurchase transaction, or repo, market. BNY Mellon 

currently has approximately 84% of the market share 
of the U.S. tri-party repo market. As agent, we 

facilitate settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) 
and investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and investor 
agree to a tri-party repo trade and send instructions to 
us. We settle the trade, maintain custody of the 

collateral (the subject securities of the repo), monitor 
the eligibility and sufficiency of the collateral, and 

execute the payment and delivery instructions agreed 
to and provided by the principals. Providing tri-party repo agent services to repo counterparties exposes BNY Mellon to credit risk at 

certain points in time. To facilitate trade settlement 

and collateral substitutions, we extend secured 
intraday credit to repo sellers (cash borrowers). In 

the event of a default by a repo seller to whom we 
have extended secured intraday credit, we would be 
at risk for the market value of the collateral securing 
such intraday credit, and for any shortfall in value 
after the liquidation of such collateral, which could 
adversely affect our results of operations. 
BNY Mellon continues to work to significantly 
reduce the risk associated with the secured intraday 
credit it provides to dealers with respect to tri-party 
repo trades. We have implemented several important 

measures in that regard, including reducing the amount of time during which we extend intraday 
credit, implementing three-way trade confirmations, 
reducing the amount of credit provided in connection 
with processing collateral substitutions, introducing a 
functionality that enables us to ﬁrollﬂ maturing trades 
into new trades without extending credit, and 
requiring dealers to prefund their repayment 
obligations in connection with trades collateralized by 
DTC sourced securities. Additionally in 2013, we 

have limited the collateral eligible for intraday credit 
to certain more liquid asset classes, resulting in a 
reduction of exposures secured by less liquid forms of 
collateral. These efforts are consistent with the 

recommendations by the Tri-Party Repo 

Infrastructure Reform Task Force (the ﬁTask Forceﬂ) 

that was sponsored by the Payments Risk Committee 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and 

included representatives from a diverse group of 
market participants, including BNY Mellon. 
We anticipate that the combination of these measures 
will have reduced risks substantially in our tri-party 
repo business in the near term, and together with 
technology enhancements currently in development, 
will achieve the practical elimination (defined as a 
90% reduction) of intraday credit related to tri-party 
repo processing by the end of 2014. We believe the steps we are taking are responsive to  
concerns voiced publicly by regulators that financial 
services companies should reduce reliance on 
intraday credit provided by their tri-party repo agent 
banks and make risk management practices more 
resilient to stress events. Nevertheless, if a BNY 

Mellon client that is party to a repurchase transaction 
cleared by BNY Mellon becomes bankrupt or 

insolvent, BNY Mellon may become involved in 

disputes and litigation with the client™s bankruptcy 

estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory 
investigations, all of which can increase BNY 
Mellon™s operational and litigation costs and may 

result in losses if the securities in the repurchase 
transaction decline in value. We anticipate that regulators will continue to monitor 
the actions of market participants and use available 
supervisory tools to encourage constructive and 
timely action to reduce sources of risk in the tri-party 
repo market. Failure to meet regulatory expectations 

could result in regulatory and reputation risk and 
additional costs.  110 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not 

effectively manage our liquidity. 
Our business is dependent in part on our ability to meet our cash and collateral obligations at a 
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected 
cash flows. We attract client deposits through a 

variety of investment management and investment 
servicing businesses and we rely on those deposits as 
a low-cost and stable source of funding. Our ability 

to continue to attract those deposits, and other short-
term funding sources, is subject to variability based 
on a number of factors, including volume and 
volatility in the global securities markets, the relative 
interest rates that we are prepared to pay for those 
deposits and the perception of safety of those deposits 
or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-
term investments available to our clients. We could 

lose deposits if we suffer a significant decline in the 

level of our business activity, our credit ratings are 

materially downgraded or we are subject to 
significant negative press or significant regulatory 
action or litigation, among other reasons. If we were 

to lose a significant amount of deposits we may need 
to replace such funding with more expensive funding 
and/or reduce assets, which would reduce our net 
interest revenue. In addition, the Parent™s access to 

both short-term money markets and long-term capital 
markets are significant sources of liquidity.  Events or 

circumstances often outside of our control, such as 
market disruptions or loss of confidence of securities 
purchasers or counterparties in us or in the funds 
markets, could limit our access to capital markets, 
increase our cost of borrowing, adversely affect our 

liquidity, or impair our ability to execute our business 

plan. We also rely on dividends from our subsidiaries 

for funding. However, there are regulatory 

limitations on the extent to which our bank 
subsidiaries can supply funds to the Parent. If we are 

not able to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we 
could be required to replace such funds through more 
expensive means and/or reduce assets. If we are 

unable to raise funds using the methods described 
above, we would likely need to finance or liquidate 
unencumbered assets, such as our investment 
portfolio, central bank deposits and bank placements, 
to meet funding needs. We may be unable to sell 

some of our assets, or we may have to sell assets at a 
discount from market value, either of which could 
adversely affect our financial condition and results of 

operations. Further, our ability to sell assets may be 

impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time, which could occur 
in a liquidity or other market crisis. Additionally, if 

we experience cash flow mismatches, deposit run-off 

or market constraints resulting from our inability to 
convert assets to cash or raise cash in the markets, our 
liquidity could be severely impacted. During periods 

of market uncertainty, our level of client deposits has 

in recent years tended to increase; however since such 
deposits have a foreseeable potential not to be 
permanent, we have historically deposited these so-
called excess deposits with central banks and in other 
highly liquid and low-yielding instruments. These 

levels of excess client deposits, as a consequence, 
have increased our net interest revenue but have 
adversely affected our net interest margin.  For a 

further discussion of our liquidity, see ﬁLiquidity and 

dividendsﬂ in the MD&A - Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report. 
We could incur income statement charges through 
provision expense if our reserves for credit losses, 
including loan reserves, are inadequate. When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter 
into a letter of credit or other contract with a 
counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses 

if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our 
counterparties fail to perform according to the terms 
of their agreements. Our credit exposure is 

comprised of seven classes of financing receivables: 
financial institutions, commercial, commercial real 
estate, lease financings, wealth management loans 
and mortgages, overdrafts, and other residential 
mortgages. Though credit risk is inherent in lending 

activities, our revenues and profitability are adversely 
affected when our borrowers default in whole or in 

part on their loan obligations to us or when there is a 
significant change in the credit quality of our loan 
portfolio. We reserve for credit losses by establishing 

an allowance through a charge to earnings.  The 

allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represents management™s 

estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit 
portfolio. We utilize a quantitative methodology, 

which is supplemented with a qualitative framework 
that takes into account internal and external 
environmental factors that are not captured within the 
quantitative methodology, to determine the allowance 

for credit losses. This process requires us to make 

numerous complex and subjective estimates and 
assumptions relating to amounts which are inherently 
uncertain. As is the case with any such assessments, 

there is always the chance that we will fail to identify BNY Mellon 111 
 (continued)the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we do identify.  We 

cannot provide any assurance as to whether charge-

offs related to our credit exposure may occur in the 

future. Current and future market and economic 

developments may increase default and delinquency 
rates and negatively impact the quality of our credit 
portfolio, which may impact our charge-offs.  If the 

allowance for credit losses is inadequate due to 
deterioration in the credit quality of the portfolio or 
significant charge-offs, we would be required to 

record credit loss provisions against current earnings, 
which could adversely impact our net income. Other Risk 
Tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions 
with respect to historical transactions may adversely 
affect our net income, effective tax rate and our 

overall results of operations and financial condition. In the course of our business, we receive inquiries and challenges from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax 
authorities on the amount of taxes we owe. If we are 

not successful in defending these inquiries and 
challenges, we may be required to adjust the timing 
or amount of taxable income or deductions or the 
allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of 
which can require a greater provision for taxes or 
otherwise negatively affect earnings.  Probabilities 

and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and 
adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary, 

but the reserves may prove inadequate because we 
cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of 
any challenge, settlement or litigation or to what 
extent it will negatively affect us or our business.  In 

addition, new tax laws or changes in existing tax laws 
or the interpretation of those laws worldwide could 
have a material impact on our net income. See Note 

12 to Consolidated Financial Statements in this 
Annual Report for further information. Changes in accounting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements and events 
occurring subsequent to the financial statements 
could have a material impact on our reported 
financial condition, results of operations and other 
financial data. From time to time, the FASB, the IASB, the SEC and 
bank regulators change the financial accounting and 
reporting standards governing the preparation of our 
financial statements or the interpretation of those standards. In some cases, we could be required to 

apply a new or revised standard retroactively, 

resulting in our booking retroactive adjustments or 
restating prior period financial statements. See 

ﬁRecent Accounting Developmentsﬂ in the MD&A 

section and Note 2 to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in this Annual Report.  These changes are 

difficult to predict and can materially impact how we 

record and report our financial condition and results 
of operations and other financial data. Additionally, our accounting policies and methods are 
fundamental to how we record and report our 
financial condition and results of operations. Some 

of these policies and methods require use of estimates 
and assumptions that may affect the reported value of 

our assets or liabilities and results of operations and 
are critical because they require management to make 
difficult, subjective and complex judgments about 

matters that are inherently uncertain. If subsequent 

events occur that are materially different than the 

assumptions and estimates we used, we could be 
required to correct and restate prior period financial 
statements. We are a non-operating holding company, and as a 
result, are dependent on dividends from our 
subsidiaries, including our subsidiary banks, to meet 
our obligations, including our obligations with 
respect to our securities, and to provide funds for 
payment of dividends to our stockholders and stock 
repurchases. We are a non-operating holding company, whose 
principal assets and sources of income are our bank 
subsidiaries - The Bank of New York Mellon and 

BNY Mellon, N.A. - and our other subsidiaries.  We 

are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banks 
and other subsidiaries and, therefore, we rely 
primarily on dividends and interest from these bank 
and other subsidiaries to meet our obligations, 
including our obligations with respect to our 
securities, and to provide funds for payment of 
common and preferred dividends to our stockholders, 
to the extent declared by our Board of Directors. At 

the same time, Federal Reserve rules provide that a 
bank holding company is expected to serve as a 
source of financial strength to its bank subsidiaries 
and to commit resources to support such banks if 
necessary. 
There are various legal limitations on the extent to which our bank and other subsidiaries can finance or  112 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) otherwise supply funds to us (by dividend or otherwise) and certain of our affiliates.  Many of our 

subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, are 
subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or 
authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the 
flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent 
company or other subsidiaries. Our bank subsidiaries 

are also subject to restrictions on their ability to lend 
to or transact with affiliates and to minimum 

regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well 
as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited 
with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their 
businesses. Although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at the holding company level, if our bank subsidiaries or 
other subsidiaries were unable to supply us with cash 
over time, we could be unable to meet our obligations 
(including our obligations with respect to our 
securities), declare or pay dividends in respect of our 
capital stock, or perform stock repurchases. See 

ﬁMD&A - Supervision and Regulation,ﬂ ﬁMD&A - 

Results of Operations - Liquidity and dividendsﬂ and 
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in this Annual Report.  
Because we are a holding company, our rights and the 
rights of our creditors, including the holders of our 
securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary 
upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the 
subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the 
subsidiary™s creditors (including, in the case of our 

banking subsidiaries, their depositors) except to the 
extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with 
recognized claims against the subsidiary.  The rights 

of holders of our securities to benefit from those 
distributions will also be junior to those prior claims. 
Consequently, our securities will be effectively 

subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of 
our subsidiaries. Our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors 
and may be limited by the Federal Reserve, 
applicable provisions of Delaware law or our failure 
to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred 
stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions of 
capital as our Board of Directors may declare out of 
funds legally available for such payments. Although 

we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. In 

addition to the Board of Directors™ approval, our 

ability to take certain actions, including our ability to 
make acquisitions, declare dividends or repurchase 
our common stock, is dependent in part upon Federal 
Reserve non-objection under the annual regulatory 
review of the results of the CCAR process required 
by the Federal Reserve and the supervisory stress 
tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  These 

evaluations, in turn, are dependent on, among other 
things, our successful demonstration that such actions 
would not adversely affect our regulatory capital 

position in the event of a stressed market 
environment. The Federal Reserve™s current guidance 

provides that, for large BHCs like us, common stock 

dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net 

income will receive particularly close scrutiny.  A 

failure to increase dividends along with our 
competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of, 
our common stock dividend would likely adversely 
affect the market price of our common stock and 

market perceptions of BNY Mellon. 
Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our 
common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to 
the preferred stock as to the payment of dividends 
and/or the distribution of any assets on any 
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of BNY 
Mellon will be prohibited, subject to certain 
exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and 
pay in full dividends for the then current dividend 
period of our Series A preferred stock or the last 

preceding dividend period of our Series C and Series 
D preferred stock. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital standards and 
certain related provisions of Dodd-Frank applicable 
to U.S. bank holding companies and banks. Portions 

of these rules are subject to interpretation and the 
rules will not be substantially phased in until 2019. 
However, these rules, together with our designation 

as a SIFI and a G-SIB, will result in increases in the 
minimum levels of regulatory capital that we and our 
subsidiary banks will be required to maintain, as well 
as changes in the manner in which our regulatory 
capital ratios are calculated. The requirement to 

maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity may 
constrain our ability to return capital to shareholders 
either in the form of common stock dividends or 
share repurchases. BNY Mellon 113 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
ASU - 2014-01 - Accounting for Investments in 
Qualified Affordable Housing Projects - a Consensus 

of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force 
In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (ﬁFASBﬂ) issued Accounting Standards Update 

(ﬁASUﬂ) 2014-01, ﬁAccounting for Investments in 
Qualified Affordable Housing Projects - a Consensus 

of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force.ﬂ  This ASU 

permits entities that invest in a qualified affordable 

housing project through a limited liability entity to 
elect to account for the income statement effects of 

such investments using the proportional amortization 
method if certain conditions are met. The impact to 

the income statement would be recorded in income 
tax expense. For those investments in qualified 

affordable housing projects not accounted for using 

the proportional amortization method, the investment 
would be accounted for as an equity method 
investment or cost method investment. This ASU is 

effective for periods beginning on or after Dec. 15, 

2014. Early adoption is permitted. BNY Mellon has 

not yet quantified the impact of the new standard. Proposed Accounting Standards 

Proposed ASU - Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers In June 2010, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁRevenue from Contracts with Customers.ﬂ This 

proposed ASU is the result of a joint project of the 

FASB and the International Accounting Standards 

Board (ﬁIASBﬂ) to clarify the principles for 
recognizing revenue and develop a common standard 
for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting 

Standards (ﬁIFRSﬂ). This proposed ASU would 

establish a broad principle that would require an 
entity to identify the contract with a customer, 

identify the separate performance obligations in the 
contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the 
transaction price to the separate performance 
obligations and recognize revenue when each 
separate performance obligation is satisfied. In 2011, 

the FASB and the IASB revised several aspects of the 

original proposal to include distinguishing between 
goods and services, segmenting contracts, accounting 
for warranty obligations and deferring contract 
origination costs. In November 2011, the FASB re-exposed the 

proposed ASU.  A final standard is expected to be 

issued during the first half of 2014. The FASB and 

IASB tentatively decided that the effective date of the 

proposed standard would be annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2017. Proposed ASU - Principal versus Agent Analysis 

In November 2011, the FASB issued a proposed ASU 
ﬁPrincipal versus Agent Analysis.ﬂ  This proposed 

ASU would rescind the 2010 indefinite deferral of 
FAS 167 for certain investment funds, including 

mutual funds, hedge funds, mortgage real estate 
investment funds, private equity funds, and venture 
capital funds, and amends the pre-existing guidance 
for evaluating consolidation of voting general 
partnerships and similar entities. The proposed ASU 

also amends the criteria for determining whether an 
entity is a variable interest entity under FAS 167, 

which could affect whether an entity is within its 

scope. Accordingly, certain funds that previously 

were not consolidated must be reviewed to determine 
whether they will now be required to be consolidated. 
The proposed accounting standard will continue to 
require BNY Mellon to determine whether or not it 

has a variable interest in a variable interest entity.  

However, consolidation of its variable interest entity 

and voting general partnership asset management 
funds will be based on whether or not BNY Mellon, 

as the asset manager, uses its power as a decision 

maker as either a principal or an agent. Based on a 

preliminary review of the proposed ASU, we do not 

expect to be required to consolidate additional mutual 
funds, hedge funds, mortgage real estate investment 
funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds. 
In addition, we expect to deconsolidate a portion of 
the CLOs we currently consolidate, with further 
deconsolidation possible depending on future changes 
to BNY Mellon™s investment in subordinated notes.  

The FASB has recently begun redeliberating the 

proposed ASU.  A final ASU is expected to be issued 

during the second half of 2014. Proposed ASU - Leases 

In May 2013, the FASB and IASB issued a revised 
proposed ASU on leases.  The proposed ASU 

introduces new accounting models for both lessees 
and lessors, primarily to address concerns related to 
off-balance-sheet financing arrangements available to 

lessees under current guidance. The proposal would 

require lessees to account for all leases on the balance  114 BNY Mellon 

(continued) sheet, except for certain short-term leases that have a maximum possible lease term of 12 months or less, 
including any options to renew.  A lessee would 

recognize on its balance sheet (1) an asset for its right 
to use the underlying asset over the lease term and (2) 
a liability representing its obligation to make lease 
payments over the lease term. The income statement 

impact for lessees would depend on the nature of the 
underlying asset - that is, whether the underlying 
asset is property or an asset other than property - and 
the terms and conditions of the lease. The proposed 

ASU also introduces new accounting guidance for 
lessors. Lessors would account for leases under 

either the new receivable-and-residual approach or an 
approach similar to current operating-lease 
accounting. The appropriate approach to use would 

depend on the nature of the underlying asset - that is, 
whether the underlying asset is property or an asset 
other than property - and the terms and conditions of 
the lease. If finalized, the proposed ASU would 

converge the most significant aspects of the FASB™s 

and IASB™s accounting for lease contracts.  

Comments on this proposed ASU were due in 

September 2013. Proposed ASU - Financial Instruments - Credit 
Losses In December 2012, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses.ﬂ This 

proposed ASU would result in a single model to 

account for credit losses on financial assets. The 

proposal would remove the probable threshold for 
recognizing credit losses and require a current 
estimate of the expected contractual cash flows an 
entity does not expect to collect on financial assets 
that are not measured at fair value through the income 
statement. The proposal would also change current 

practice for recognizing OTTI and interest income on 
debt securities. In addition, the proposal would result 

in the recognition of an allowance for credit losses for 
nearly all types of debt instruments. The proposal 

would expand the credit quality disclosures to require 
information about changes in the factors that 
influence estimates of credit losses and the reasons 
for those changes. The Board has tentatively decided 

to continue to refine the current expected credit loss 
model. Proposed ASU - Effective Control for Transfers with 

Forward Agreements to Repurchase Assets and 

Accounting for Repurchase Financings 
In January 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁEffective Control for Transfers with Forward 

Agreements to Repurchase Assets and Accounting for 

Repurchase Financings.ﬂ This proposed ASU would 

require certain repurchase agreements to be 
accounted for as secured borrowings. For repurchase 

agreements and similar transactions accounted for as 
secured borrowings, an entity would be required to 
disclose the carrying value of the borrowing 
disaggregated by the type of collateral pledged. The 

proposed ASU would be effective for annual and 

interim periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2014. Proposed ASU - Recognition and Measurement of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In February 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets 

and Financial Liabilities.ﬂ This proposed ASU would 

affect entities that hold financial assets and liabilities 

and would change the methodology related to 
recognition, classification, measurement and 
presentation of financial instruments. The scope of 

the proposed ASU would exclude instruments 

classified in shareholders™ equity, share-based 

arrangements, pension plans, leases, guarantees and 
derivative instruments accounted under ASC 815, 

Derivatives and Hedging. Financial assets would be 

classified and measured based on the instrument™s 

cash flow characteristics and an entity™s business 

model for managing the instrument. Financial 

liabilities would generally be measured initially at 
their transaction price. The proposal includes three 

principal classification and measurement categories: 
(1) fair value for which all changes in fair value are 
recognized in net income; (2) fair value with 
qualifying changes in fair value recognized in other 
comprehensive income; and (3) amortized cost. This 

proposed ASU requires financial assets and liabilities 

to be presented separately on the balance sheet by 
measurement category.  In addition, the fair value of 

financial assets and liabilities accounted for under 
amortized cost would be presented parenthetically on 
the balance sheet. In January 2014, the FASB 

tentatively decided not to continue to pursue the 
business model assessment approach for 
classification and measurement of financial assets. 
The Board is considering whether it should align, or BNY Mellon 115 
 
(continued)keep separate, the recognition and measurement accounting models for debt securities and loans. Proposed ASU - Reporting Discontinued Operations 

In April 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
ﬁReporting Discontinued Operations.ﬂ This proposed 

ASU would change the criteria and enhance the 
reporting for discontinued operations. The proposal 

would also enhance disclosure requirements and add 
new disclosures for individually material dispositions 
that do not qualify as discontinued operations. Under 

the proposal, a discontinued operation is a component 
of an entity, or group of components of an entity, that 

either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for 
sale and (1) is part of a single coordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or 
separate major geographical area of operations, or (2) 
is a business that, on acquisition, meets the criteria 
for classification as held for sale. The proposal no 

longer precludes the presentation of a discontinued 
operation if there is significant continuing 
involvement with the component after the disposal or 
if there are ongoing operations or cash flows. Under 

the proposal, for disposals that are material but do not 

tax income or losses of the disposed component and a 
reconciliation of the major classes of assets and 
liabilities held for sale to the amounts presented 
separately on the balance sheet would be required. A 

final standard is expected to be issued during the first 
half of 2014. Adoption of new accounting standards 

For a discussion of the adoption of new accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. IFRS 
IFRS are a set of standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB. Commencing with the 

issuance of the ﬁroadmapﬂ in November 2008, the 
SEC has considered potential methods of 
incorporation of IFRS in the United States. The use 

of IFRS for U.S. companies with global operations 
would allow for streamlined reporting, allow for 
easier access to foreign capital markets and 
investments, and facilitate cross-border acquisitions, 
ventures or spin-offs.  
In July 2012, the SEC staff released its final report on 

IFRS. This Final Report will be used by the SEC 

Commissioners to decide whether and, if so, when 
and how to incorporate IFRS into the financial 
reporting system for U.S. companies. It is not known 

when the SEC will make a final decision on the 
adoption of IFRS in the United States. While the SEC decides whether IFRS will be required to be used in the preparation of our consolidated 
financial statements, a number of countries have 
mandated the use of IFRS by BNY Mellon™s 

subsidiaries in their statutory reports filed in those 
countries. Such countries include Belgium, Brazil, 

the Netherlands, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada and 

South Korea. Update to Internal Controls - Integrated Framework 

On May 14, 2013, The Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission 

(ﬁCOSOﬂ) issued an updated version of its Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (the ﬁ2013 
Frameworkﬂ). Originally issued in 1992, the 

framework helps organizations design, implement 

and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls.  

Updates to the framework were intended to clarify 
internal control concepts and simplify their use and 
application. The 1992 framework will remain 

available during the transition period, which extends 
to Dec. 15, 2014, after which time COSO will 
consider it as superseded by the 2013 Framework. 
Concurrent with the 2013 Framework release, COSO 
indicated that organizations reporting externally 

should clearly disclose whether the original 
Framework or the updated Framework was utilized.  116 BNY Mellon 
We are prepared for events that could damage our 
physical facilities, cause delay or disruptions to 
operational functions, including telecommunications 
networks, or impair our employees, clients, vendors 
and counterparties. Key elements of our business 

continuity strategies are extensive planning and 
testing, and diversity of business operations, data 
centers and telecommunications infrastructure. We have established multiple geographically diverse 
locations for our funds transfer and broker-dealer 

services operational units, which provide redundant 
functionality to facilitate uninterrupted operations. Our securities clearing, commercial paper, mutual 
fund accounting and custody, securities lending, 

master trust, Unit Investment Trust, corporate trust, 

item processing, wealth management and treasury 
units have common functionality in multiple sites 
designed to facilitate continuance of operations or 
rapid recovery.  In addition, we have recovery 

positions for over 13,100 employees on a global basis 
of which over 7,100 are proprietary. 
We continue to enhance geographic diversity for 
business operations by moving additional personnel 
to growth centers outside of existing major urban 
centers. We replicate 100% of our critical production 

computer data to multiple recovery data centers. We have an active telecommunications diversity 
program. All major buildings and data centers have 

diverse telecommunications carriers. The data 

centers have multiple fiber optic rings and have been 
designed so that there is no single point of failure. All major buildings have been designed with diverse telecommunications access and connect to at least 
two geographically dispersed connection points. We 

have an active program to audit circuits for route 
diversity and to test customer back-up connections. In 2003, the Federal Reserve, OCC and SEC jointly published the Interagency Paper, ﬁSound Practices to 

Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial 
Systemﬂ (ﬁSound Practices Paperﬂ). The purpose of 

the document was to define the guidelines for the 
financial services industry and other interested parties 
regarding ﬁbest practicesﬂ related to business 
continuity planning. Under these guidelines, we are a 

key clearing and settlement organization required to 

meet a higher standard for business continuity. 
We believe we meet substantially all of the 

requirements of the Sound Practices Paper.  As a core 

clearing and settlement organization, we believe that 

we are at the forefront of the industry in improving 
business continuity practices. We are committed to seeing that requirements for 
business continuity are met not just within our own 
facilities, but also within those of vendors and service 
providers whose operation is critical to our safety and 
soundness. To that end, we have a Service Provider 

Management Office whose function is to review new 

and existing service providers and vendors to see that 
they meet our standards for business continuity, as 

well as for information security, financial stability, 

and personnel practices, etc. We have developed a comprehensive plan to prepare 
for the possibility of a flu pandemic, which 
anticipates significant reduced staffing levels and will 

provide for increased remote working by staff for one 

or more periods lasting several weeks. Although we are committed to observing best practices as well as meeting regulatory requirements, 
geopolitical uncertainties and other external factors 
will continue to create risk that cannot always be 
identified and anticipated. Due to BNY Mellon™s robust business recovery 
systems and processes, we are not materially 
impacted by climate change, nor do we expect 
material impacts in the near term. We have, and will 

continue to, implement processes and capital projects 
to deal with the risks of the changing climate. The 

Company has invested in the development of 
products and services that support the markets related 
to climate change. BNY Mellon 117 
     
BNY Mellon has included in this Annual Report 
certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon 

Tier 1 common equity and tangible common 

shareholders™ equity.  BNY Mellon believes that the 

ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 

and the ratio of tangible common shareholders™ equity 

to tangible assets of operations are measures of 
capital strength that provide additional useful 
information to investors, supplementing the Tier 1 

and Total capital ratios which are utilized by 

regulatory authorities. The ratio of Basel I Tier 1 

common equity to risk-weighted assets excludes 
preferred stock and trust preferred securities from the 
numerator of the ratio. Unlike the Basel I Tier 1 and 

Total capital ratios, the tangible common 

shareholders™ equity ratio fully incorporates those 

changes in investment securities valuations which are 
reflected in total shareholders™ equity.  In addition, 

this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual 
book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a 
risk-based reduced value established in accordance 
with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon 

in its calculation has excluded certain assets which 
are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory 
purposes. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the 

return on tangible common equity measure, which 
excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of 
deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure 
for investors because it presents a measure of BNY 
Mellon™s performance in reference to those assets that 

are productive in generating income. BNY Mellon 

has provided a measure of tangible book value per 
share, which it believes provides additional useful 
information as to the level of such assets in relation to 
shares of common stock outstanding. BNY Mellon 

has presented its estimated Basel III Tier 1 common 

equity ratio based on its interpretation, expectations 
and understanding of the final Basel III rules released 
by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013, on a fully 
phased-in basis and on the application of such rules to 
BNY Mellon™s businesses as currently conducted.  

The estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio is 

necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY 
Mellon™s further review and implementation of the 

final Basel III rules, anticipated compliance with all 
necessary enhancements to model calibration, and 
other refinements, further implementation guidance 
from regulators and any changes BNY Mellon may 

make to its businesses. Consequently, BNY Mellon™s 

estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio may 
change based on these factors. Management views 

the estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio as 

a key measure in monitoring BNY Mellon™s capital 

position and progress against future regulatory capital 
standards. Additionally, the presentation of the 

estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio is 

intended to allow investors to compare BNY Mellon™s 

estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio with 

estimates presented by other companies. BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures that 
exclude the effect of net securities gains (losses) and 

noncontrolling interests related to consolidated 
investment management funds; and expense measures 
which exclude M&I expenses, litigation charges, 

restructuring charges, asset-based taxes and 

amortization of intangible assets; and measures which 
utilize net income excluding tax items such as the net 
charge related to the disallowance of certain foreign 

tax credits and the benefit of tax settlements and 
discrete tax benefits related to a tax loss on 
mortgages. Return on equity measures and operating 

margin measures, which exclude some or all of these 

items, are also presented. Return on equity measures 

also exclude the net charge related to the 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits. BNY 

Mellon believes these measures are useful to 

period comparisons, which relate to the ability of 
BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses 

in circumstances where such matters are within BNY 
Mellon™s control.  The excluded items, in general, 

relate to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior 

transactions or where we have incurred charges. M&I 

expenses primarily relate to the acquisitions of Global 
Investment Servicing on July 1, 2010 and BHF Asset 

Servicing GmbH on Aug. 2, 2010.  M&I expenses 

generally continue for approximately three years after 
the transaction and can vary on a year-to-year basis 

depending on the stage of the integration. BNY 

Mellon believes the exclusion of M&I expenses 
provides investors with a focus on BNY Mellon™s 

business as it would appear on a consolidated going-
forward basis, after such M&I expenses have ceased. 
Future periods will not reflect such M&I expenses, 
and thus may be more easily compared with our 
current results if M&I expenses are excluded. 
Litigation charges represent accruals for loss 

contingencies that are both probable and reasonably 
estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal 
fees. Restructuring charges relate to our Operational 

Excellence Initiatives and migrating positions to 
Global Delivery Centers. Excluding these charges 
 118 BNY Mellon 
€   (continued) permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. The presentation of income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income 
attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the 
consolidation of certain investment management 
funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis 
consistent with how management views the business. 
BNY Mellon believes these presentations, as a 

supplement to GAAP information, give investors a 

clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. In this Annual Report, the net interest margin is 

presented on an FTE basis. We believe this 

presentation provides comparability of amounts 
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, 
and is consistent with industry practice. The 

adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net 
income. Each of these measures as described above 

is used by management to monitor financial 
performance, both on a company-wide and business-
level basis. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per common share. 2013 Net Diluted

Estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio Œ Non-GAAP calculated under theAdvanced Approach 11.3% 9.8% 7.1% (a) At Dec. 31, 2013, the estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio is based on our interpretation of the Final Capital Rules released 
by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013, on a fully phased-in basis. For periods prior to Dec. 31, 2013, these ratios were estimated using 

our interpretation of the NPRs dated June 7, 2012, on a fully phased-in basis. 
(b) Following are the primary differences between risk-weighted assets determined under Basel I and Basel III.  Credit risk is determined 

under Basel I using predetermined risk-weights and asset classes and relies in part on the use of external credit ratings.  Under Basel III 

both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches use a broader range of predetermined risk-weights and asset classes and certain 

alternatives to external credit ratings.  Securitization exposure receives a higher risk-weighting under Basel III than Basel I, and Basel 

III includes additional adjustments for market risk, counterparty credit risk and equity exposures.  Additionally, the Standardized 

Approach eliminates the use of the VaR approach for determining risk-weighted assets on certain repo-style transactions.  Risk-weighted 

assets calculated under the Advanced Approach also include the use of internal credit models and parameters as well as an adjustment 

for operational risk. (c) Changes in January 2014 to the probable loss model associated with unsecured wholesale credit exposures within our Advanced 

Approach capital model will impact risk-weighted assets.  The Company did not include the impact at Dec. 31, 2013. However, a 

preliminary estimate of the revised methodology to the portfolio at Sept. 30, 2013 would have added approximately 6% to the risk-

weighted assets.  122 BNY Mellon

 Management of BNY Mellon is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting for BNY Mellon, as 

such term is defined in Rule€13a-15(f) under the 
Exchange Act. 
BNY Mellon™s management, including its principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, has 

assessed the effectiveness of BNY Mellon™s internal 

control over financial reporting as of December€31, 
2013. In making this assessment, management used 

the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992). 
Based upon such assessment, management believes 
that, as of December€31, 2013, BNY Mellon™s 

internal control over financial reporting is effective 

based upon those criteria. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public 
accounting firm that audited BNY Mellon™s 2013 

financial statements included in this Annual Report 

under ﬁFinancial Statements and Notes,ﬂ has issued a 
report with respect to the effectiveness of BNY 

Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting.  

This report appears on page 133. 
 132 BNY Mellon 
  The Board of Directors and Shareholders The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation™s (ﬁBNY Mellonﬂ) internal control over financial 
reporting as of December€31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) 

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). BNY Mellon™s 

management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment 

of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of 

Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on BNY 
Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit 

included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 

assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal control over financial reporting 

includes those policies and procedures that (1)€pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)€provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)€provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s 

assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 

become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, BNY Mellon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December€31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States), the consolidated balance sheets of BNY Mellon as of December€31, 2013 and 2012, and the related 

consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years 

in the three-year period ended December€31, 2013, and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified 
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. New York, New York

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  140 BNY Mellon 
 Basis of presentation 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY Mellon, a global financial services company, 

conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (ﬁGAAPﬂ) and prevailing industry 
practices. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows for the annual 
periods presented have been made. These financial 

statements should be read in conjunction with BNY 
Mellon™s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 

ended Dec. 31, 2013. Certain immaterial 

reclassifications have been made to prior periods to 
place them on a basis comparable with current period 
presentation. Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make 

estimates based upon assumptions about future 
economic and market conditions which affect 

reported amounts and related disclosures in our 
financial statements. Although our current estimates 

contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible 
that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated 
in those estimates, which could materially affect our 

results of operations and financial condition. 
Amounts subject to estimates are items such as the 
allowance for loan losses and lending-related 
commitments, the fair value of financial instruments 
and other-than-temporary impairments, goodwill and 

intangible assets and pension accounting. Among 

other effects, such changes in estimates could result 

in future impairments of investment securities, 
goodwill and intangible assets and establishment of 
allowances for loan losses and lending-related 
commitments as well as changes in pension and post-
retirement expense. Equity method investments 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries.  Equity 

investments of less than a majority but at least 20% 
ownership are accounted for by the equity method 
and classified as other assets. Earnings on these 

investments are reflected in fee and other revenue as 
investment services fees, investment management and 
performance fees or investment and other income, as 
appropriate, in the period earned. A loss in value of an equity investment that is 
determined to be other-than-temporary, is recognized 

by reducing the carrying value of the equity 
investment down to its fair value. Our most significant equity method investments are: Equity method investments at Dec. 31, 2013 Percentage(dollars in millions) ownership Book€value CIBC Mellon 50.0% $ 576 
Wing Hang 20.8% $ 535 
Siguler Guff 20.0% $ 278 
ConvergEx 33.9% $ 133 
(a) (a) In addition to the common ownership interest noted, BNY 
Mellon also holds an interest in ConvergEx nonvoting Series 

B preferred units.€ The book value at Dec. 31, 2013 is 

reflective of our combined common and preferred interests in 

ConvergEx. 
Acquired businesses 
The income statement and balance sheet include results of acquired businesses accounted for under the 
acquisition method of accounting pursuant to ASC 

805, Business Combinations and equity investments 
from the dates of acquisition. For acquisitions 

completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we record the fair 
value of any contingent payments as an additional 
cost of the equity acquired in the period that the 
payment becomes probable. For acquisitions 

completed after Jan. 1, 2009, contingent purchase 
consideration was measured at its fair value and 
recorded on the purchase date. Any subsequent 

changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration 
liability will be recorded through the income 
statement. Parent financial statements 

The Parent financial statements in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include 
the accounts of the Parent; those of a wholly-owned 
financing subsidiary that functions as a financing 
entity for BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries; and 

MIPA, LLC, a single-member limited liability 
BNY Mellon 141 
  (continued)company, created to hold and administer corporate-
owned life insurance. Financial data for the Parent, 

the financing subsidiary and the single-member 
limited liability company are combined for financial 
reporting purposes because of the limited function of 
these entities and the unconditional guarantee by 
BNY Mellon of their obligations. 
Nature of operations 

BNY Mellon is a global leader in providing a broad 
range of financial products and services in domestic 
and international markets. Through our two principal 

businesses, Investment Management and Investment 
Services, we serve the following major classes of 
customers - institutions, corporations, and high net 
worth individuals. For institutions and corporations, 

we provide the following services: Ł investment management; Ł trust and custody; Ł foreign exchange; Ł fund administration; Ł global collateral services; Ł securities lending; Ł depositary receipts; Ł corporate trust; Ł global payment/cash management; Ł banking services; and Ł clearing services. For individuals, we provide mutual funds, separate 
accounts, wealth management and private banking 
services. BNY Mellon™s investment management 

businesses provide investment products in many asset 
classes and investment styles on a global basis. Variable interest entities 

Accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities (ﬁVIEsﬂ) is included in ASC 810 

Consolidation, ASU 2009-17 ﬁImprovements to 
Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with 
Variable Interest Entitiesﬂ, and ASU 2010-10 

ﬁAmendments for Certain Investment Funds,ﬂ which 
defers ASU 2009-17 for certain asset managers™ 

interests in entities that apply the specialized 
accounting guidance for investment companies or that 
have the attributes of investment companies and for 
interests in money market funds. VIEs are defined as certain entities in which the 
equity investors: Ł do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity 

to finance its activities without additional 
subordinated financial support; or Ł lack one or more of the following characteristics of 
a controlling financial interest: Ł The power, through voting rights or similar 

rights, to direct the activities of an entity that 
most significantly impact the entity™s economic 

performance (ASU 2009-17 model). Ł The direct or indirect ability to make decisions 
about the entity™s activities through voting 

rights or similar rights (ASC 810 model). Ł The obligation to absorb the expected losses of 
the entity. 
Ł The right to receive the expected residual 
returns of the entity.
We consider the underlying facts and circumstances 

of individual transactions when assessing whether or 
not an entity is a potential VIE.  BNY Mellon is 

required to consolidate a VIE if BNY Mellon is 

determined to be the primary beneficiary. 
As a result of ASU 2010-10, BNY Mellon continues 
to apply ASC 810 to its mutual funds, hedge funds, 

private equity funds, collective investment funds and 
real estate investment trusts. If these entities are 

determined to be VIEs, primary beneficiary 

calculations are prepared in accordance with ASC 

810 to determine whether or not BNY Mellon is the 

primary beneficiary and required to consolidate the 
VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party 

that absorbs a majority of the VIE™s expected losses, 

receives a majority of its expected residual returns or 
both. BNY Mellon has two securitizations and several 
CLOs, which are assessed for consolidation in 
accordance with ASU 2009-17.  The primary 

beneficiary of these VIE™s is the party that has both: 

(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that 

most significantly impact that entity™s economic 

performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses, 
or the right to receive benefits, from the VIE that 

could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
 142 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) Voting interest entities 
If BNY Mellon can exert control over the financial 
and operating policies of an investee, which generally 
can occur if there is a 50% or more voting interest or 

if partners or members of an investee do not have 
certain substantive rights, BNY Mellon consolidates 

the investee. Investees structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which BNY Mellon is either 

the general partner or managing member are 
presumed to be controlled by BNY Mellon.  In 

accordance with ASC 810-20 
Control of Partnerships 

and Similar Entities, we review the rights of the limited partners and members to determine whether 
that presumption can be overcome. The presumption 

of control is overcome when the limited partners or 
managing members have the ability to dissolve the 
entity, can remove BNY Mellon, as the general 

partner or managing member without cause based on 
a simple majority vote of unaffiliated limited partners 

or members or have other substantive participating 
rights. If the presumption of control is not overcome, 

the entity is consolidated. Trading account securities, available-for-sale 
securities, and held-to-maturity securities Securities are accounted for under ASC 320 
Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Securities are classified in the trading, available-for-sale 

investment or the held-to-maturity investment 
securities portfolios when they are purchased. 
Securities are classified as trading securities when our 
intention is to resell the securities. Securities are 

classified as available-for-sale securities when we 

intend to hold the securities for an indefinite period of 
time or when the securities may be used for tactical 
asset/liability purposes and may be sold from time to 
time to effectively manage interest rate exposure, 

prepayment risk and liquidity needs. Securities are 

classified as held-to-maturity securities when we 
intend to hold them until maturity.  
Trading securities are stated at fair value.  Trading 
revenue includes both realized and unrealized gains 
and losses. The liability incurred on short-sale 

transactions, representing the obligation to deliver 
securities, is included in trading liabilities at fair Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value.  

The difference between fair value and amortized cost 

representing unrealized gains or losses on assets 
classified as available-for-sale, are recorded net of tax 

as an addition to or deduction from other 
comprehensive income (ﬁOCIﬂ), unless a security is 
deemed to have an other-than-temporary impairment 

(ﬁOTTIﬂ). Gains and losses on sales of available-for

sale securities are reported in the income statement. 
The cost of debt and equity securities sold is 
determined on a specific identification and average 
cost method, respectively.  Held-to-maturity securities 

are stated at cost. Income on investment securities purchased is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion 
of discount on a level yield basis. We routinely conduct periodic reviews to identify and 
evaluate each investment security to determine 
whether OTTI has occurred. We examine various 

factors when determining whether an impairment, 
representing the fair value of a security being below 
its amortized cost, is other than temporary.  The 

following are examples of factors that BNY Mellon 

considers: Ł The length of time and the extent to which the 
fair value has been less than the amortized cost 
basis; Ł Whether management has an intent to sell the 
security; Ł Whether the decline in fair value is attributable to 
specific adverse conditions affecting a particular 

investment; Ł Whether the decline in fair value is attributable to 
specific conditions, such as conditions in an 
industry or in a geographic area; Ł Whether a debt security has been downgraded by 
a rating agency; Ł Whether a debt security exhibits cash flow 
deterioration; and Ł For each non-agency RMBS, we compare the 
remaining credit enhancement that protects the 
individual security from losses against the 
projected losses of principal and/or interest 
expected to come from the underlying mortgage 
collateral, to determine whether such credit losses 
might directly impact the relevant security. 
value.The determination of whether a credit loss exists is 
based on best estimates of the present value of cash 
flows to be collected from the debt security.  
BNY Mellon 143 
   (continued)Generally, cash flows are discounted at the effective 
interest rate implicit in the debt security at the time of 
acquisition. For debt securities that are beneficial 

interests in securitized financial assets and are not 
high credit quality, ASC 325 provides that cash flows 

be discounted at the current yield used to accrete the 
beneficial interest. The credit component of an OTTI of a debt security is recognized in earnings and the non-credit component 
is recognized in OCI when we do not intend to sell 
the security and it is more likely than not that BNY 
Mellon will not be required to sell the security prior 
to recovery of its cost basis. For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of OTTI recorded in OCI for the non-credit portion of a 
previous OTTI is amortized prospectively, as an 

increase to the carrying amount of the security, over 

the remaining life of the security on the basis of the 
timing of future estimated cash flows of the 
securities. In order not to be required to recognize 

the non-credit component of an OTTI in earnings, 
management is required to assert that it does not have 
the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely 
than not it will not have to sell the security before 
recovery of its cost basis. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that BNY Mellon will be required to sell the 


credit component of OTTI is recognized in earnings 
and subsequently accreted to interest income on an 
effective yield basis over the life of the security. 
The accounting policies for the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and OTTI have 
been identified as ﬁcritical accounting estimatesﬂ as 
they require us to make numerous assumptions based 
on available market data. See Note 4 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for these 
disclosures. Loans and leases 
Loans are reported net of any unearned discount. Certain loan origination and upfront commitment 
fees, as well as certain direct loan origination and 
commitment costs, are deferred and amortized as a 
yield adjustment over the lives of the related loans. 
Deferred fees and costs are netted against outstanding 
loan balances. Loans held for sale are carried at the 

lower of cost or market value. Unearned revenue on direct financing leases is 
accreted over the lives of the leases in decreasing 
amounts to provide a constant rate of return on the net 
investment in the leases. Revenue on leveraged 

leases is recognized on a basis to achieve a constant 
yield on the outstanding investment in the lease, net 
of the related deferred tax liability, in the years in 

which the net investment is positive. Gains and 

losses on residual values of leased equipment sold are 
included in investment and other income. 
Considering the nature of these leases and the number 
of significant assumptions, there is risk associated 
with the income recognition on these leases should 
any of the assumptions change materially in future 
periods. Nonperforming assets 
Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or 

more, or when there is reasonable doubt that interest 
or principal will be collected. When a first lien residential mortgage loan reaches 90 
days delinquent, it is subject to an impairment test 
and may be placed on nonaccrual status. At 180 days 

delinquent, the loan is subject to further impairment 
testing. The loan will remain on accrual status if the 

realizable value of the collateral exceeds the unpaid 
principal balance plus accrued interest. If the loan is 

impaired, a charge-off is taken and the loan is placed 

on nonaccrual status. At 270 days delinquent, all first 

lien mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status. 
Second lien mortgages are automatically placed on 
nonaccrual status when they reach 90 days  

delinquent. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is 
reversed against current period interest revenue. 
Interest receipts on nonaccrual and impaired loans are 
recognized as interest revenue or are applied to 
principal when we believe the ultimate collectability 
of principal is in doubt. Nonaccrual loans generally 

are restored to an accrual basis when principal and 
interest become current and remain current for a 
specified period. A loan is considered to be impaired, as defined by 
ASC 310 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of 

a Loan, when it is probable that we will be unable to 
collect all principal and interest amounts due 
according to the contractual terms of the loan  144 BNY Mellon 
    (continued) agreement. An impairment allowance on loans $1 
million or greater is required to be measured based 

upon the loan™s market price, the present value of 

expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan™s 

initial effective interest rate, or at fair value of the 

collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the 

loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the 
loan, an impairment allowance is established by a 
provision for credit loss. Impairment allowances are 

not needed when the recorded investment in an 
impaired loan is less than the loan valuation. Allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments 
The allowance for loan losses, shown as a valuation allowance to loans, and the allowance for lending-
related commitments recorded in other liabilities are 
referred to as BNY Mellon™s allowance for credit 

losses. The accounting policy for the determination 

of the adequacy of the allowances has been identified 
as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it requires us to 
make numerous complex and subjective estimates 
and assumptions relating to amounts which are 
inherently uncertain. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance 
sheet date based on our judgment. The allowance 

determination methodology is designed to provide 
procedural discipline in assessing the appropriateness 
of the allowance. Credit losses are charged against 

the allowance. Recoveries are added to the 

allowance. The methodology for determining the allowance for lending-related commitments considers the same 
factors as the allowance for loan losses, as well as an 
estimate of the probability of drawdown. We utilize a 

quantitative methodology and qualitative framework 
for determining the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments. Within 

this qualitative framework, management applies 
judgment when assessing internal risk factors and 
environmental factors to compute an additional 
allowance for each component of the loan portfolio. The three elements of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments 
include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: Ł an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million 

or greater; Ł an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits; and Ł an allowance for residential mortgage loans. Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. 
As a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 

million.  Therefore, the first element, impaired 

credits, is based on individual analysis of all impaired 
loans of $1 million and greater.  The allowance is 

measured by the difference between the recorded 

value of impaired loans and their impaired value. 
Impaired value is either the present value of the 
expected future cash flows from the borrower, the 

market value of the loan, or the fair value of the 
collateral. The second element, higher risk-rated credits and pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 
model. All loans over $1 million are individually 

analyzed before being assigned a credit rating. All 

borrowers are assigned to pools based on their credit 
rating. The probable loss inherent in each loan in a 

pool incorporates the borrower™s credit rating, loss 

given default rating and maturity.  The loss given 

default incorporates a recovery expectation and an 
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage 
given default). The borrower™s probability of default 

is derived from the associated credit rating. Borrower 

ratings are reviewed at least annually and are 
periodically mapped to third-party databases, 
including rating agency and default and recovery 
databases, to ensure ongoing consistency and validity.  

Higher risk-rated credits are reviewed quarterly. 
The third element, the allowance for residential mortgage loans, is determined by segregating six 

mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging 
from current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 
default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. In 2012, BNY Mellon began 

assigning all residential mortgage pools, except home 
equity lines of credit, a probability of default and loss 
given default based on default and loss data derived 
from our residential mortgage portfolio. Prior to 

2012, estimates of probability of default and loss 
given default factors were based on a combination of 
external data from third-party databases and internal 
data. The decision to change was triggered when five 

years of historical data became available in 2012. 
The use of internal historical data provides a better BNY Mellon 145 
  (continued)estimate of the allowance, given that it is based on actual default and loss experience on our residential 
mortgage portfolio. For each pool, the inherent loss 

is calculated using the above factors. The resulting 

probable loss factor (the probability of default 
multiplied by the loss given default) is applied against 
the loan balance to determine the allowance held for 
each pool. For home equity lines of credit, 

probability of default and loss given default are based 
on external data from third-party databases due to the 
small size of the portfolio and insufficient internal 

data. The qualitative framework is used to determine an additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 
factors below: Internal risk factors: Ł Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Ł Criticized assets to total loans and lending-related commitments; Ł Ratings volatility; Ł Borrower concentration; and Ł Significant concentration in high risk industries. Environmental risk factors: Ł U.S. non-investment grade default rate; Ł Unemployment rate; and Ł Change in real GDP The objective of the qualitative framework is to 
capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 
captured in the quantitative reserve, which is based 
primarily on historical data. Management determines 

the qualitative allowance each period based on 
judgment informed by consideration of internal and 
external risk factors and other considerations that 
may be deemed relevant during the period. Once 

determined in the aggregate, our qualitative 
allowance is then allocated to each of our loan classes 
based on the respective classes™ quantitative 

allowance balances with the allocations adjusted, 
when necessary, for class specific risk factors.  
For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to 
evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 
The distribution of historical experience is compared 
to the risk factor™s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 
relative to our historical experience. 
Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level - no 
impact, low, moderate, high and elevated - to each 

risk factor for the current quarter.  Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine 
an aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the 

impact of any particular risk factor.  Management™s 

assessment of the risk factors, as well as the trend in 
the quantitative allowance, supports management™s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 
allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 
reflected incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. A greater qualitative allowance 

may be required if our quantitative allowance does 
not yet reflect the incurred losses associated with the 
aggregate risk level. The allocation of allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 
regardless of the nature of the loss. Premises and equipment 

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, 
over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased 
facility or the estimated economic life of the 
improvement. For owned and capitalized assets, 

estimated useful lives range from 2 to 40 years.  

Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as 

incurred, while major improvements are capitalized 
and amortized to operating expense over their 
identified useful lives. Software 

BNY Mellon capitalizes costs relating to acquired 
software and internal-use software development 
projects that provide new or significantly improved 
functionality.  We capitalize projects that are expected 

to result in longer-term operational benefits, such as 

replacement systems or new applications that result in 
significantly increased operational efficiencies or 

functionality.  All other costs incurred in connection 

with an internal-use software project are expensed as 
incurred. Capitalized software is recorded in other 

assets.  146 BNY Mellon 
   (continued) Identified intangible assets and goodwill Identified intangible assets with estimable lives are amortized in a pattern consistent with the assets™ 
identifiable cash flows or using a straight-line method 
over their remaining estimated benefit periods if the 
pattern of cash flows is not estimable. Intangible 

assets with estimable lives are reviewed for possible 
impairment when events or changed circumstances 
may affect the underlying basis of the asset.  

Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not 
amortized, but are assessed annually for impairment, 
or more often if events and circumstances indicate it 
is more likely than not they may be impaired. The 

accounting policy for valuing and impairment testing 
of identified intangible assets and goodwill has been 
identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it 
requires us to make numerous complex and 
subjective estimates. See Note 6 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
disclosures related to goodwill and intangible assets. Seed capital 
Seed capital investments are classified as other assets. Unrealized gains and losses on seed capital 
investments are recorded in investment and other 
income. Noncontrolling interests 

Noncontrolling interests included in permanent equity are adjusted for the income or (loss) attributable to 
the noncontrolling interest holders and any 
distributions to those shareholders. Redeemable 

noncontrolling interests are reported as temporary 
equity.  In accordance with ASC 480, 
Distinguishing 
Liabilities from Equity
, BNY Mellon recognizes 
changes in the redemption value of the redeemable 
noncontrolling interests as they occur and adjusts the 
carrying value to be equal to the redemption value. Fee revenue 

We record investment services fees, investment 
management fees, foreign exchange and other trading 
revenue, financing-related fees, distribution and 
servicing, and other revenue when the services are 
provided and earned based on contractual terms, 
when amounts are determined and collectibility is 
reasonably assured. Additionally

refundable, upfront implementation fees under 
outsourcing contracts using a straight-line method, 
commencing in the period the ongoing services are 
performed through the expected term of the 
contractual relationship. Incremental direct set-up 

costs of implementation, up to the related 
implementation fee or minimum fee revenue amount, 
are deferred and amortized over the same period that 
the related implementation fees are recognized. If a 

client terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely, 

the unamortized deferred incremental direct set-up 
costs and the unamortized deferred up-front 
implementation fees related to that contract are 
recognized in the period the contract is terminated. Performance fees are recognized in the period in which the performance fees are earned and become 
determinable. Performance fees are generally 

calculated as a percentage of the applicable 
portfolio™s performance in excess of a benchmark 

index or a peer group™s performance.  When a 

portfolio underperforms its benchmark or fails to 
generate positive performance, subsequent years™ 
performance must generally exceed this shortfall 
prior to fees being earned. Amounts billable in 

subsequent years and which are subject to a clawback 
if performance thresholds in those years are not met, 
are not recognized since the fees are potentially 
uncollectible. These fees are recognized when it is 

determined that they will be collected. When a multi-

year performance contract provides that fees earned 
are billed ratably over the performance period, only 
the portion of the fees earned that are non-refundable 
are recognized. Net interest revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities is recognized based on the 
effective yield of the related financial instrument. 
Foreign currency translation 

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the rate of 
exchange on the balance sheet date. Transaction 

gains and losses are included in the income statement. 
Translation gains and losses on investments in foreign 

entities with functional currencies that are not the 
U.S. dollar are recorded as foreign currency 
translation adjustments in other comprehensive 
income (loss). Revenue and expense transactions are 
BNY Mellon 147 
 (continued)translated at the applicable daily rate or the weighted average monthly exchange rate when applying the 
daily rate is not practical. Pension 
The measurement date for BNY Mellon™s pension 
plans is Dec. 31. Plan assets are determined based on 

fair value generally representing observable market 
prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined 

based on the present value of projected benefit 
distributions at an assumed discount rate. The 

discount rate utilized is based on the yield curves of 
high-quality corporate bonds available in the 
marketplace. The net periodic pension expense or 

credit includes service costs, interest costs based on 
an assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan 
assets based on an actuarially derived market-related 
value and amortization of prior years™ actuarial gains 

and losses. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, gains or losses related to changes in the 
amount of the projected benefit obligation or plan 
assets resulting from experience different from the 

assumed rate of return, changes in the discount rate or 
other assumptions. To the extent an actuarial gain or 

loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected 
benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan 
assets, the excess is recognized over the future 
service periods of active employees. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated returns for each applicable 
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the 

expected allocation for each asset class and are based 
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and 

term historical returns for these markets. We also 

consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global 
economies, as well as current and prospective interest 
rates. The market-related value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair 
value of plan assets adjusted for the difference 

between expected returns and actual performance of 
plan assets. The difference between actual experience 

and expected returns on plan assets is included as an 
adjustment in the market-related value over a five-

year period. BNY Mellon™s accounting policy regarding pensions 

has been identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ 
as it requires management to make numerous 
complex and subjective assumptions relating to 
amounts which are inherently uncertain. See Note 18 

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional disclosures related to pensions. Severance 
BNY
based employees through The Bank of New York 

Mellon Corporation Supplemental Unemployment 
Benefit Plan. These benefits are provided to eligible 

employees separated from their jobs for business 
reasons not related to individual performance. Basic 

separation benefits are generally based on the 
employee™s years of continuous benefited service.  

Severance for employees based outside of the U.S. is 
determined in accordance with local agreements and 
legal requirements. Severance expense is recorded 

when management commits to an action that will 
result in separation and the amount of the liability can 
be reasonably estimated. Income taxes 
We record current tax liabilities or assets through 
charges or credits to the current tax provision for the 

estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current 
year.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 

for future tax consequences attributable to differences 

between the financial statement carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 

expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax 

valuation allowance is established if it is more likely 
than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 
will not be realized. A tax position that fails to meet a 

more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will result 
in either reduction of current or deferred tax assets, 
and/or recording of current or deferred tax liabilities. 
Interest and penalties related to income taxes are 
recorded as income tax expense. Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative contracts, such as futures contracts, forwards, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps 
and options and similar products used in trading 
activities are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses 
 148 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) are included in foreign exchange and other trading revenue in fee and other revenue. Unrealized gains 

are recognized as trading assets and unrealized losses 
are recognized as trading liabilities, after taking into 
consideration master netting agreements. We enter into various derivative financial instruments 
for non-trading purposes primarily as part of our 
asset/liability management (ﬁALMﬂ) process. These 

derivatives are designated as either fair value or cash 
flow hedges of certain assets and liabilities when we 
enter into the derivative contracts. Gains and losses 

associated with fair value hedges are recorded in 
income as well as any change in the value of the 
related hedged item associated with the designated 
risks being hedged. Gains and losses on cash flow 

hedges are recorded in OCI, until reclassified into 
earnings to meet the risks being hedged. Foreign 

currency transaction gains and losses related to a 
hedged net investment in a foreign operation, net of 
their tax effect, are recorded with cumulative foreign 

currency translation adjustments within OCI. We formally document all relationships between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our 
risk-management objectives and strategy for 
undertaking various hedging transactions. We formally assess, both at the hedge™s inception and 
on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are 
used in hedging transactions are highly effective and 

whether those derivatives are expected to remain 
highly effective in future periods.  At inception, the 

potential causes of ineffectiveness related to each of 

our hedges is assessed to determine if we can expect 
the hedge to be highly effective over the life of the 

transaction and to determine the method for 
evaluating effectiveness on an ongoing basis. 
Recognizing that changes in the value of derivatives used for hedging or the value of hedged items could 
result in significant ineffectiveness, we have 

processes in place that are designed to identify and 
evaluate such changes when they occur.  Quarterly, 

we perform a quantitative effectiveness assessment 

and record any ineffectiveness in current earnings. 
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when 
we determine that a derivative is no longer an 
effective hedge, the derivative expires, is sold, or 

management discontinues the derivative™s hedge 

designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these 

derivatives are included in foreign exchange and other trading revenue. For discontinued fair value 

hedges, the accumulated gain or loss on the hedged 
item is amortized on a yield basis over the remaining 
life of the hedged item. Accumulated gains and 

losses, net of tax effect, from discontinued cash flow 

hedges are reclassified from OCI and recognized in 
current earnings in foreign exchange and other 
trading revenue upon receipt of the hedged cash flow. 
The accounting policy for the determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments has been 
identified as a ﬁcritical accounting estimateﬂ as it 
requires us to make numerous assumptions based on 
the available market data. See Note 23 of the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
disclosures related to derivative financial instruments. Statement of cash flows 
We have defined cash as cash and due from banks.  
Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in 
the same category as the items hedged. Stock-based compensation 
Compensation expense relating to all share-based payments is recognized in the income statement, on a 
straight-line basis, over the applicable vesting period. Certain of our stock compensation grants vest when the employee retires. ASC 718 requires the 

completion of expensing of new grants with this 
feature by the first date the employee is eligible to 
retire. 
ASU 2011-11 -  Disclosures about Offsetting Assets 
and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, 
ﬁDisclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilitiesﬂ.  

Entities are required to disclose both gross 
information and net information about both 
instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the 

balance sheet and instruments and transactions 
subject to an agreement similar to a master netting 
arrangement. The scope includes derivatives, sale 

and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and 
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and 
securities lending arrangements. See Note 23 

ﬁDerivative instrumentsﬂ of the Notes to BNY Mellon 149 
  (continued)Consolidated Financial Statements for the related disclosure. ASU 2012-02 - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
Assets for Impairment In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, 
ﬁTesting Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for 

Impairment.ﬂ This guidance allows an entity an 

option to first assess qualitative factors to determine 
whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of 
more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived 
intangible asset is impaired. If the intangible asset is 

impaired, an entity is required to perform the 
quantitative impairment test. An entity is not 

required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-
lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative 
impairment test unless the entity determines that it is 
more likely than not that the asset is impaired. ASU 2013-02 - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified 
Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, 
ﬁReporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.ﬂ This 

ASU requires the presentation of the effects on the 

line items of net income of significant amounts 
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive 
income. See Note 16 ﬁOther comprehensive income 

(loss)ﬂ of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the related disclosure. 

We sometimes structure our acquisitions with both an 
initial payment and later contingent payments tied to 
post-closing revenue or income growth. For 

acquisitions completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we 
recorded the fair value of contingent payments as an 
additional cost of the entity acquired in the period 
that the payment becomes probable. For acquisitions 

completed after Jan. 1, 2009, subsequent changes in 
the fair value of a contingent consideration liability 
are recorded through the income statement. 
Contingent payments totaled $19 million in 2013. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, we were potentially obligated to pay additional consideration which, using reasonable 
assumptions for the performance of the acquired 
companies and joint ventures based on contractual 
agreements, could amount to $6 million over the next 

six months. The acquisitions and dispositions 
described below did not have a material impact on 
BNY Mellon™s results of operations. 
Dispositions in 2013 
On May€31, 2013, BNY Mellon sold SourceNet 
Solutions, our accounts payable outsourcing support 
services provider that was part of our Investment 
Services business, for $11 million.  As a result of this 

sale, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $2 million and an 

after-tax gain of $10 million. 
On Sept. 27, 2013, Newton Management Limited, together with Newton Investment Management 
Limited, an investment boutique of BNY Mellon, 

sold Newton™s private client business, for $120 

million.  As a result of this sale, we recorded a pre-tax 

gain of $27 million and an after-tax gain of $5 

million.  In addition, goodwill of $69 million and 

customer relationship intangible assets of $7 million 

were removed from the balance sheet as a result of 
this sale. Acquisition in 2012 
On Oct 1, 2012, BNY Mellon acquired the remaining 
50% interest of the WestLB Mellon Asset 

Management joint venture for cash of $22 million, 

plus a contingent payment of $13 million which was 

paid in August 2013.  We later renamed the unit 

Meriten Investment Management GmbH. Goodwill 

related to this acquisition totaled $70 million and is 

included in our Investment Management business. 
This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Customer relationship intangible assets related to this 
acquisition are included in our Investment 
Management business, with a life of eight years, and 

totaled $23 million at acquisition. 
Acquisitions in 2011 

On July€1, 2011, BNY Mellon acquired the wealth 
management operations of Chicago-based Talon 

Asset Management (ﬁTalonﬂ) for cash of $11 million.  

We are obligated to pay, upon occurrence of certain 

events, contingent additional consideration of $5 

million which was recorded as goodwill at the 

acquisition date. Talon manages assets of wealthy 

families and institutions. Goodwill related to this 

acquisition, is included in our Investment 
Management business and totaled $10 million and is 

deductible for tax purposes. Customer relationship 

intangible assets related to this acquisition are  150 BNY Mellon 
   €(continued) included in our Investment Management business, with a life of 20 years, and totaled $6 million at 

acquisition. On Nov. 30, 2011, BNY Mellon acquired Penson 
Financial Services Australia Pty Ltd., a clearing firm 

located in Australia, in a $33 million share purchase 

transaction. Goodwill related to this acquisition is 

included in our Investment Services business and 
totaled $10 million and is non-tax deductible.  

Customer relationship intangible assets related to this 
acquisition are included in our Investment Services 
business, with a life of nine years, and totaled $6 

million at acquisition. 
Disposition in 2011 

On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold the Shareowner 
Services business. The sales price of $550 million 

resulted in a pre-tax gain of $98 million.  We 

recorded an immaterial after-tax gain primarily due to 

the write-off of non-tax deductible goodwill 

associated with the business. Excluding the gain on 

the sale, the Shareowner Services business 
contributed $273 million of revenue and $21 million 

of pre-tax income in 2011.

At Dec. 31, 2013, the book value and the fair value of UK sovereign debt of $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion 

respectively, exceeded 10% of BNY Mellon™s 

shareholders™ equity.  In 2013, Agency RMBS 

securities with an amortized cost of $7.3 billion and 

fair value of $7.0 billion were transferred from 

available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity 

securities. This action, in addition to realizing gains 

on the sales of securities, is expected to mute the 
impact to our accumulated other comprehensive 
income in the event of a rise in interest rates.  152 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) Temporarily impaired securities 
At Dec. 31, 2013, substantially all of the unrealized losses on the investment securities portfolio were 
attributable to an increase in interest rates and credit 
spreads widening since purchase. We do not intend to 

sell these securities and it is not more likely than not 
that we will have to sell these securities. The following tables show the aggregate related fair 
value of investments with a continuous unrealized 
loss position for less than 12 months and those that

(b) Includes money market funds. Other-than-temporary impairment 
We routinely conduct periodic reviews of all 
securities using economic models to identify and 
evaluate each investment security to determine 
whether OTTI has occurred. Various inputs to the 

economic models are used to determine if an 
unrealized loss on securities is other-than-temporary.  

For example, the most significant inputs related to 
non-agency RMBS are: Ł Default rate - the number of mortgage loans expected to go into default over the life of the transaction, which is driven by the roll rate of 
loans in each performance bucket that will 
ultimately migrate to default; and Ł Severity - the loss expected to be realized when a loan defaults. To determine if an unrealized loss is other

temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the 

underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 
calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 
upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 
in order to determine the projected collateral loss. In 

determining estimated default rate and severity 
assumptions, we review the performance of the 
underlying securities, industry studies, market 
forecasts, as well as our view of the economic outlook affecting collateral.  We also evaluate the 

current credit enhancement underlying the bond to 
determine the impact on cash flows. If we determine 

that a given security will be subject to a write-down 
or loss, we record the expected credit loss as a charge 

to earnings. The table below shows the projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities for the 2007, 
2006 and late 2005 non-agency RMBS and the 
securities previously held in the Grantor Trust that we 

established in connection with the restructuring of our 
investment securities portfolio in 2009, at Dec. 31, 

2013 and Dec. 31, 2012. Projected weighted-average default rates and loss severities Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 Default€rate Severity

Pledged assets At Dec. 31, 2013, assets amounting to $81 billion 
were pledged primarily for potential borrowing at the 
Federal Reserve Discount Window.  The significant 

components of pledged assets were as follows: $70 

billion of securities, $5 billion of loans, $5 billion of 

trading assets and $1 billion of interest-bearing 

deposits with banks. We obtain securities under 

resale, securities borrowed, derivative contracts and 
custody agreements on terms which permit us to 
repledge or resell the securities to others. As of Dec. 

31, 2013, the market value of the securities received 
that can be sold or repledged was $31 billion.  We 

routinely repledge or lend these securities to third 
parties. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the market value of 

collateral sold or repledged was $13 billion.

In the ordinary course of business, we and our 
banking subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing 
interest rates and terms to our directors and executive 
officers and to entities in which certain of our 

directors have an ownership interest or direct or 
indirect subsidiaries of such entities. The aggregate 

amount of these loans was $3 million at Dec. 31, 

2013, $5 million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $3 million at  

Dec. 31, 2011.  These loans are primarily extensions 

of credit under revolving lines of credit established 
for such entities. Our loan portfolio is comprised of three portfolio segments: commercial, lease financings and 
mortgages. We manage our portfolio at the class 

level which is comprised of six classes of financing 
receivables: commercial, commercial real estate, 
financial institutions, lease financings, wealth 
management loans and mortgages and other 
residential mortgages. The following tables are

(ﬁTDRsﬂ) A modified loan is considered a TDR if the debtor is transfer of real estate or other assets from the debtor 
experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor to the creditor, or a modification of the term of the

Other residential mortgages 

The modifications of the other residential mortgage loans in 2013 and 2012 consisted of reducing the 
stated interest rates and in certain cases, a forbearance 
of default and extending the maturity dates. The 

value of modified loans is based on the fair value of 
the collateral. Probable loss factors are applied to the 

value of the modified loans to determine the 
allowance for credit losses. Commercial 

The modifications of the commercial loans and unfunded lending-related commitments in 2012 consisted of changing the stated interest rates and/or 
extending the maturity dates of the loans. The 

difference between the book value of the loan and net 

cash flow discounted at the original loan™s rate, if no 

observable market price exists, is included in the 
allowance for credit losses. Commercial real estate

The modification of the foreign loan in 2012 
consisted of extending the maturity date of the loan. 
The difference between the book value of the loan 

and the net present value discounted at the original

losses. TDRs that subsequently defaulted There were 35 residential mortgage loans that had been restructured in a TDR during the previous 12 

months and have subsequently defaulted in 2013.  

The total recorded investment of these loans was $8 

million. 
Credit quality indicators Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade names to support cross-selling opportunities and 
avoid single name/industry concentrations. Each 

customer is assigned an internal credit rating which is 
mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent 
based upon a number of dimensions which are 
continually evaluated and may change over time. The following tables set forth information about credit quality indicators. Commercial loan portfolio

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment grade and non-investment grade 
categories based on rating criteria largely consistent 

with those of the public rating agencies. Each 

customer in the portfolio is assigned an internal credit 
rating. These internal credit ratings are generally 

consistent with the ratings categories of the public 
rating agencies. Customers with ratings consistent 

with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3 (Moody™s) or better are 

considered to be investment grade. Those clients 

with ratings lower than this threshold are considered 
to be non-investment grade. Wealth management loans and mortgages

$ 8,864 
Wealth management non-mortgage loans are not 

typically rated by external rating agencies. A 

majority of the wealth management loans are secured 
by the customers™ investment management accounts 

or custody accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these 

loans are typically investment-grade, fixed-income 
securities, equities and/or mutual funds. Internal 

ratings for this portion of the wealth management  160 BNY Mellon 
125      (continued) portfolio, therefore, would equate to investment-grade external ratings. Wealth management loans are 

provided to select customers based on the pledge of 
other types of assets, including business assets, fixed 
assets or a modest amount of commercial real estate. 
For the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit 
quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do 
not consider this portfolio of loans to be investment 
grade. Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages are not correlated to external ratings. 
Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to 

high-net-worth individuals, which are secured 
primarily by residential property.  These loans are 

primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages with 
an average loan-to-value ratio of 64% at origination.  

In the wealth management portfolio, 1% of the 

mortgages were past due at Dec. 31, 2013. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, the private wealth mortgage portfolio was comprised of the following geographic 
concentrations: New York - 21%; California - 21%; 

Massachusetts - 16%; Florida - 8%; and other - 34%. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 
totaled $1,385 million at Dec. 31, 2013 and $1,632 

million at Dec. 31, 2012.  These loans are not 

typically correlated to external ratings. Included in 

this portfolio at Dec. 31, 2013 are $411 million of 

mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 
quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 
mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans.  

As of Dec. 31, 2013, the purchased loans in this 

portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 
of 76% at origination and 20% of the serviced loan 

balance was at least 60 days delinquent. The 

properties securing the prime and Alt-A mortgage 

loans were located (in order of concentration) in 
California, Florida, Virginia, the tri-state area (New 

York, New Jersey and Connecticut) and Maryland. 
Overdrafts 

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities clearance clients and totaled $3,715 million at Dec. 

31, 2013 and $5,298 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  

Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in the custody and 
securities clearance business and are generally repaid 
within two business days. 
Margin loans 
We had $15,652 million of secured margin loans on 
our balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2013 compared with 

$13,397 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  Margin loans are 

collateralized with marketable securities and 
borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral 
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan.  

We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans 

and do not allocate any of our allowance for credit 
losses to margin loans. 
Other loans 
Other loans primarily includes loans to consumers that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual 
funds and fixed income securities, as well as bankers™ 
acceptances. Reverse repurchase agreements 

Reverse repurchase agreements are transactions fully collateralized with high-quality liquid securities. 
These transactions carry minimal credit risk and 
therefore are not allocated an allowance for credit 
losses. Matter related to Sentinel 

In August 2007, BNY Mellon loaned $312 million to 
an asset manager, Sentinel Management Group, Inc. 

(ﬁSentinelﬂ), secured by securities and cash.€Sentinel 

filed for bankruptcy in 2007, and BNY Mellon™s 

status as a secured lender is the subject of continuing 
litigation. In 2010, the district court ruled in favor of 

BNY Mellon, and the loan was repaid.  An appellate 

court reversed the district court™s ruling on Aug. 26, 

2013, and remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings. BNY Mellon held no loans to Sentinel 

at Dec. 31, 2013. On Jan. 22, 2014, the Bankruptcy 

Court, ordered that the funds distributed to BNY 
Mellon after the district court™s favorable decision be 

returned to the bankruptcy estate and held in a reserve 
earmarked for purposes of BNY Mellon™s claim until 

the district court issues its decision on the merits of 
the challenges to BNY Mellon™s lien.  Accordingly, 

the loan was reestablished as a fully collateralized 
performing loan in the first quarter of 2014. The 

ongoing litigation could result in a ruling adverse to 
BNY Mellon at some point in the future.  For 

additional information on our legal proceedings 
related to this matter, see Note 22 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. BNY Mellon 161 
   (continued)Impairment testing 
BNY Mellon™s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing 
is performed on an annual basis. The Investment 

Management segment is comprised of two reporting 

units. The Investment Services segment is comprised 

of four reporting units. One reporting unit is included 

in the Other segment. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step compares the estimated fair 

value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill 
of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. 
However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit 

were to exceed its estimated fair value, a second step 
would be performed that would compare the implied 
fair value of the reporting unit™s goodwill with the 

carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment 
loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying 
amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. BNY Mellon conducted its annual goodwill 
impairment test on a quantitative basis on all seven 
reporting units in the second quarter of 2013. The 

estimated fair value of the Company™s seven 

reporting units exceeded the carrying value and no 
goodwill impairment was recognized. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment or more often if events or 
circumstances indicate they may be impaired. Goodwill 
Total goodwill decreased in 2013 compared with 
2012 resulting from the sale of Newton™s private 
client business primarily offset by the impact of 
foreign exchange translation on non-U.S. dollar 
denominated goodwill. The table below provides a 

breakdown of goodwill by business.

In our Investment Management business, we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 
money market and alternative investment funds for 
institutions and other investors. As part of that 

activity we make seed capital investments in certain 
funds. BNY Mellon also holds private equity 

investments, which consist of investments in private 
equity funds, mezzanine financings and direct equity 
investments. Seed capital and private equity 
investments are included in other assets. Consistent 

with our policy to focus on our core activities, we 
continue to reduce our exposure to private equity 
investments. The fair value of these investments has been estimated using the net asset value (ﬁNAVﬂ) per share 

of BNY Mellon™s ownership interest in the funds.

In 2011, we announced our Operational Excellence 
Initiatives which include an expense reduction 
initiative impacting approximately 1,500 positions, as 

well as additional initiatives to transform operations, 
technology and corporate services that will increase 
productivity and reduce the growth rate of expenses. 
We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $107

Initiatives in 2011.  This charge was comprised of 

$78 million of severance costs and $29 million 

primarily for operating lease-related items and BNY Mellon 165

would affect the effective tax rate in future periods.  

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if 

applicable, related to income taxes in income tax 
expense. Included in the balance sheet at Dec. 31, 

2013 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $203 

million.  The additional tax expense related to interest 

for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 was $192 million 
compared with $11 million for the year ended Dec. 
31, 2012. It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next 12 
months by an amount up to $270 million as a result of 

adjustments related to tax years that are still subject 
to examination. As previously disclosed, on Nov. 10, 2009, BNY 
Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

challenging the Internal Revenue Service™s (ﬁIRSﬂ) 

disallowance of certain foreign tax credits claimed for 
the 2001 and 2002 tax years. Trial was held from 

April 16 to May 17, 2012. On Feb. 11, 2013, BNY 

Mellon received an adverse decision from the U.S. 
Tax Court.€ On Sept. 23, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court 

amended its prior ruling to allow BNY Mellon an 

interest expense deduction and to exclude certain 
items from taxable income. The net impact of the 

court rulings for all years involved and related 
interest decreased after-tax income in 2013 by $593 

million.  The U.S. Tax Court ruling was finalized on 

Feb. 20, 2014. Finally, we intend to appeal the Tax 

Court™s Feb. 11, 2013 decision disallowing the 

foreign tax credits. See Note 22 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information. Our federal income tax returns are closed for all periods through 2005. The 2006 year remains open 

to examination. The years 2007 and 2008 are also 

closed to further examination; however, one matter is 

before the IRS Appeals Division.  The years 2009 and 

2010 are currently under examination. Our New York 

State and New York City income tax returns are 

closed to examination through 2010. Our UK income 

tax returns are closed to examination through 2011.

At Dec. 31, 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of BNY Mellon (the ﬁTrustﬂ) has issued cumulative 

Company-Obligated Mandatory Redeemable Trust 

Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding 

Solely Junior Subordinated Debentures (ﬁtrust 
preferred securitiesﬂ). The sole asset of this trust is 

junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of 
BNY Mellon with maturities and interest rates that 

match the trust preferred securities. Our obligation 

under the agreement that relate to the trust preferred 
securities, the Trust and the debentures constitutes a 

full and unconditional guarantee by us of the Trust™s 

obligation under the trust preferred securities. Additionally, at Dec. 31, 2013, we also owned Mellon 
Capital IV, whose sole assets were originally junior 

subordinated debentures and a stock purchase contract for preferred stock. Through a remarketing 

in May 2012, the junior subordinated debentures 
issued by BNY Mellon and held by Mellon Capital 

IV were sold to third party investors and then 

exchanged for BNY Mellon™s senior notes, which 

were sold in a public offering.  The proceeds of the 

sale of the senior notes were used to fund the 
purchase by Mellon Capital IV of $500 million of 

BNY Mellon™s Series A preferred stock, which was 

issued on June 20, 2012. At Dec. 31, 2013, the Series 

A preferred stock was the sole asset of Mellon Capital 

IV.  
See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional disclosures 
related to preferred stock, including the Series A 

preferred stock. On June 14, 2013, BNY Mellon redeemed all 
outstanding 7.78% Trust Preferred Securities issued 

by BNY Institutional Capital Trust A (liquidation

BNY Mellon™s VIEs generally include retail, 
institutional and alternative investment funds offered 

to its retail and institutional customers in which it acts 
as the fund™s investment manager.  BNY Mellon earns 

management fees on these funds as well as 
performance fees in certain funds. It may also 
provide start-up capital in its new funds. These VIEs 

are included in the scope of ASU 2010-10 and are 

reviewed for consolidation based on the guidance in 
ASC 810, Consolidation. BNY Mellon has other VIEs, including securitization 
trusts, which are no longer considered qualifying 
special purpose entities, and CLOs, in which BNY 
Mellon serves as the investment manager.  In 
 168 BNY Mellon 
   €  €134 (continued) addition, we provide trust and custody services for a fee to entities sponsored by other corporations in 
which we have no other interest. These VIEs are 

evaluated under the guidance included in ASU 

2009-17. BNY Mellon has two securitizations and 

several CLOs, which are assessed for consolidation in 
accordance with ASU 2009-17. 
The following tables present the incremental assets and liabilities included in BNY Mellon™s consolidated

Common stock BNY Mellon has 3.5 billion authorized shares of 
common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share.  

At Dec. 31, 2013, 1,142,249,790 shares of common 
stock were outstanding. Common stock repurchase program 
On March 13, 2012, in connection with the Federal Reserve™s non-objection to our 2012 capital plan, the 

Board of Directors authorized a stock purchase 
program providing for the repurchase of an aggregate 
of $1.16 billion of common stock. On March 14, 

2013, in connection with the Federal Reserve™s non-

objection to our 2013 capital plan, the Board of 
Directors authorized a new stock purchase program 
providing for the repurchase of an aggregate of $1.35 

billion of common stock beginning in the second 

quarter of 2013 and continuing through the first 
quarter of 2014. The share repurchase program may 

be executed through open market purchases or 
privately negotiated transactions at such prices, times 
and upon such other terms as may be determined 
from time to time. In 2013, we repurchased 35.1 

million common shares at an average price of $29.24 

per common share for a total of $1.03 billion.  At 

Dec. 31, 2013, the maximum dollar value of shares

redeemed in whole but not in part at any time within 
90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event 
(as defined in the Certificate of Designations of the 
Series C preferred stock and the Certificate of 
Designations of the Series D preferred stock). Terms of the Series A preferred stock, Series C

Temporary equity 
Temporary equity was $230 million at Dec. 31, 2013 
and $178 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  Temporary equity 

represents amounts recorded for redeemable non-
controlling interests resulting from equity-classified 
share-based payment arrangements that are currently 
redeemable or are expected to become redeemable. 
The current redemption value of such awards is 
classified as temporary equity and is adjusted to its 
redemption value at each balance sheet date. Capital adequacy Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon 

and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 
established quantitative measurements. For the 

Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding 
company, our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon 

must, among other things, qualify as ﬁwell 
capitalizedﬂ. As of Dec. 31, 2013 and 2012, BNY Mellon and our 
bank subsidiaries were considered ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ 
on the basis of the Basel I Total and Tier 1 capital to 

risk-weighted assets ratios and the leverage ratio 
(Basel I Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets as 

defined for regulatory purposes). BNY Mellon 171 
     (continued)Our consolidated and largest bank subsidiary, The 
Bank of New York Mellon, capital ratios are shown 

below. 
Consolidated and largest bank Dec. 31,subsidiary capital ratios (a) 2013 2012 Consolidated capital ratios: Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 16.2% 15.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 17.0 16.3 Leverage 5.4 5.3 The Bank of New York Mellon capitalratios: Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 14.6% 14.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio 15.1 14.6 Leverage 5.3 5.4 (a) Determined under Basel I rules. Includes full capital credit 
for certain capital instruments outstanding at Dec. 31, 2013. 
A phase-out of non-qualifying instruments began on Jan. 1, 

2014. For BNY Mellon to qualify as ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ its 

Basel I Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital ratios 

must be at least 6% and 10%, respectively.  For The Bank of 

New York Mellon, our largest bank subsidiary, to qualify as 

ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ its Basel I Tier 1, Total and leverage 

capital ratios must be at least 6%, 10% and 5%, 

respectively.  For The Bank of New York Mellon to qualify as 

ﬁadequately capitalized,ﬂ Basel I Tier 1, Total and leverage 

capital ratios must be at least 4%, 8% and 3%, respectively. 
If a financial holding company such as BNY Mellon 

fails to qualify as well capitalized, it may lose its 
status as a financial holding company, which may 

restrict its ability to undertake or continue certain 
activities or make acquisitions that are not generally 
permissible for bank holding companies without 
financial holding company status. If The Bank of 

New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A. fails to 

qualify as ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ it may be subject to 
higher FDIC assessments. If a bank holding company such as BNY Mellon or 
bank such as The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A. fails to qualify as adequately 
capitalized, regulatory sanctions and limitations are 
imposed. At Dec. 31, 2013, the amounts of capital by which 
BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, 
exceed the Basel I ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ thresholds are as follows: Capital above thresholds at Dec. 31, 2013 The Bank of(in millions) Consolidated New York Mellon

  €(continued)Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted 
stock units (ﬁRSUsﬂ) and other stock-based awards to 
employees and directors of BNY Mellon.  At Dec. 31, 

2013, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved 

in April 2011, we may issue 25,689,379 new options.  

Of this amount, 11,940,138 shares (subject to 

potential increase as provided in the Long-Term 

Incentive Plan) may be issued as restricted stock or 
RSUs. Stock-based compensation expense related to 

retirement eligibility vesting totaled $65 million in 

2013, $64 million in 2012 and $31 million in 2011. 
Stock options 
Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the 
date of grant to officers and employees of BNY 

Mellon. Generally, each option granted is exercisable 

between one and ten years from the date of grant. No 

stock options were granted in 2013. The compensation cost that has been charged against 
income was $49 million for 2013, $70 million for 

2012 and $96 million for 2011.  The total income tax 

benefit recognized in the income statement was $20 

million for 2013, $29 million for 2012 and $40 

million for 2011. 
We used a lattice-based binomial method to calculate 

the fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of 

each option award is estimated on the date of grant 
using the weighted-average assumptions noted in the 
following table: Assumptions 2013 2012 2011 
Dividend yield N/A 3.0% 2.2% 
Expected volatility N/A 34 32 
Risk-free interest rate N/A 1.38 2.75 
Expected option lives(in years)N/A 6.9 6.7 
For 2012 and 2011, assumptions were determined as 
follows: Ł Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities 
from traded options on our stock, historical volatility 
of our stock, and other factors. Ł We use historical data to estimate option exercises 

and employee terminations within the valuation 
model. Ł The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual 
life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield 

curve at the time of grant. Ł The expected term of options granted is derived from 
the output of the option valuation model and 
represents the period of time that options granted are 
expected to be outstanding. A summary of the status of our options as of Dec. 31, 2013, and changes during the year, is presented below:

in 2011.  The actual tax benefit realized for the tax 

deductions from options exercised totaled $8 million 

in 2013, less than $1 million in 2012 and $2 million 

in 2011. 
Restricted stock and RSUs 
Restricted stock and RSUs are granted under our long-term incentive plans at no cost to the recipient. 
These awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 
restrictions have lapsed, including continued 
employment, for a specified period. The recipient of 

a share of restricted stock is entitled to voting rights 
and generally is entitled to dividends on the common 
stock. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a 

share of common stock after the applicable 
restrictions lapse. The recipient generally is entitled 

to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends 
paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSU is outstanding but does not receive voting rights. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the 
date of grant. The expense is recognized over the 
vesting period, which is one to four years.  The total 
compensation expense recognized for restricted stock and RSUs was $201 million in 2013, $185 million in 

2012 and $134 million in 2011.  The total income tax 

benefit recognized in the income statement was $79 
million for 2013, $76 million for 2012 and $52 
million for 2011. 
BNYMellon™s Executive Committee members were 
granted a target award of 942,428 performance units 

(ﬁPSUsﬂ) in 2013 that are earned annually based on 
an earnout percentage calculated using a metric of net 
income divided by risk-weighted assets under Basel 
III. The awards earned in each of the three 
performance periods vest at the end of the third 
performance period. Three of the awards are granted 

to FSA code-staff individuals and are required to be 

marked to market due to discretionary claw-back 
language contained in their grants. BNY Mellon™s Executive Committee members were 
granted 817,698 RSUs in 2011 which contained 

certain performance criteria that were achieved in 
2011.  The actual number of units that will ultimately 

vest is subject to negative discretion by BNY 
Mellon™s Human Resources Compensation 

Committee and as a result, are subject to variable 
accounting. BNY Mellon 175

years. The total fair value of restricted stock and RSUs that 
vested was $117 million in 2013, $84 million in 2012 
and $100 million in 2011. 
Subsidiary Long-Term Incentive plans 
BNY Mellon also has several subsidiary Long-Term 
Incentive Plans which have issued restricted 
subsidiary shares to certain employees. These share 

awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 
restrictions have lapsed, including continued 
employment for a specified period of time. The 

shares are non-voting and non-dividend paying. 
Once the restrictions lapse, which generally occurs in 
three to five years, the shares can only be sold, at the 

option of the employee, to BNY Mellon at a price 

based generally on the fair value of the subsidiary at 
the time of repurchase. In certain instances BNY 

Mellon has an election to call the shares. BNY Mellon has defined benefit and/or defined 
contribution retirement plans covering substantially 
all full-time and eligible part-time employees and 
other post-retirement plans providing healthcare 
benefits for certain retired employees.  176 BNY Mellon

  (continued) Assumed healthcare cost trend
 -Domestic post-retirement healthcare benefits 
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in determining benefit expense for 2014 is 7.00% 

decreasing to 4.75% in 2022. This projection is based 

on various economic models that forecast a 
decreasing growth rate of healthcare expenses over 
time. The underlying assumption is that healthcare 

expense growth cannot outpace gross national 
product (ﬁGNPﬂ) growth indefinitely, and over time a 

lower equilibrium growth rate will be achieved. 
Further, the growth rate assumed in 2022 bears a 

reasonable relationship to the discount rate. An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point for each year would increase the 
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by 
$16 million, or 7%, and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by $1 million, or 6%.  Conversely, a 

decrease in this rate of one percentage point for each 
year would decrease the benefit obligation by $14 

million, or 6%, and the sum of the service and interest 

costs by $1 million, or 5%. 
Assumed healthcare cost trend
 -Foreign post-
retirement healthcare benefits 

An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one percentage point for each year would increase the 
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by 
less than $1 million and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by less than $1 million.  Conversely, a 

decrease in this rate of one percentage point for each 
year would decrease the benefit obligation by less 
than $1 million and the sum of the service and 

interest costs by less than $1 million.

fund its post-retirement healthcare plans in 2014 of 

$17 million for the domestic plans and less than $1

Investment strategy and asset allocation 
BNY Mellon is responsible for the administration of 
various employee pension and healthcare post-
retirement benefits plans, both domestically and 
internationally.  The domestic plans are administered 

by BNY Mellon™s Benefits Administration 

Committee, a named fiduciary.  Subject to the 

following, at all relevant times, BNY Mellon™s 

Benefits Investment Committee, another named 
fiduciary to the domestic plans, is responsible for the 
investment of plan assets. The Benefits Investment 

Committee™s responsibilities include the investment 

of all domestic defined benefit plan assets, as well as 
the determination of investment options offered to 

participants in all domestic defined contribution 
plans. The Benefits Investment Committee conducts 

periodic reviews of investment performance, asset 
allocation and investment manager suitability.  In 
BNY Mellon 179 
 (continued)addition, the Benefits Investment Committee has oversight of the Regional Governance Committees 
for the foreign defined benefit plans. Our investment objective for U.S. and foreign plans is to maximize total return while maintaining a broadly 
diversified portfolio for the primary purpose of 
satisfying obligations for future benefit payments. Equities are the main holding of the plans. Alternative investments (including private equities) 
and fixed income securities provide diversification 
and, in certain cases, lower the volatility of returns. 
In general, equity securities and alternative 
investments within any domestic plan™s portfolio can 

be maintained in the range of 30% to 70% of total 

plan assets, fixed-income securities can range from 
20% to 50% of plan assets and cash equivalents can 
be held in amounts ranging from 0% to 5% of plan 

assets. Actual asset allocation within the approved 

ranges varies from time to time based on economic 
conditions (both current and forecast) and the advice 
of professional advisors. Our pension assets were invested as follows at Dec.

Corporation stock in our pension plans at Dec. 31, 

2013 and 2012. Assets of the U.S. post-retirement 

healthcare plan are invested in an insurance contract. Fair value measurement of plan assets 
In accordance with ASC 715, BNY Mellon has 
established a three-level hierarchy for fair value 
measurements of its pension plan assets based upon 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset as of the measurement date. The valuation hierarchy 

is consistent with guidance in ASC 820 which is 

detailed in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value, 
as well as the general classification of such assets 
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  
Cash and currency 

This category consists primarily of foreign currency balances and is included in Level 1 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  Foreign currency is translated monthly 

based on current exchange rates. Common and preferred stock, exchange traded funds 
and equity funds These investments include equities, exchange traded funds and equity funds and are valued at the closing 
price reported in the active market in which the 
individual securities are traded, if available. Where 

there are no readily available market quotations, we 
determine fair value primarily based on pricing 
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. 
Venture capital investments and partnership interests 

There are no readily available market quotations for these funds. The fair value of the investments is 

based on the pension plan™s ownership percentage of 

the fair value of the underlying funds as provided by 
the fund managers. These funds are typically valued 

on a quarterly basis. The pension plan™s venture 

capital investments and partnership interests are 
valued at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value 

and classified as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Collective trust funds 
Collective trust funds include commingled and U.S. equity funds that have no readily available market 
quotations. The fair value of the funds are based on 

the securities in the portfolio, which typically are the 
amount that the fund might reasonably expect to 
receive for the securities upon a sale. These funds are 

valued using observable inputs on either a daily or 
monthly basis. Collective trust funds are included as 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 180 BNY Mellon 
 €€€(continued) Fixed income investments Fixed income investments include U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 
government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 
foreign corporate debt funds. U.S. Treasury securities 

are valued at the closing price reported in the active 
market in which the individual security is traded and 
included as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  U.S. 

Government agencies, sovereign government 
obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and foreign 
corporate debt funds are valued based on quoted 
prices for comparable securities with similar yields 
and credit ratings. When quoted prices are not 

available for identical or similar bonds, the bonds are 
valued using discounted cash flows that maximize 
observable inputs, such as current yields of similar 
instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks 
that may not be observable, such as credit and 
liquidity risks. U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 

government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 
foreign corporate debt funds are primarily included as 
Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy with a small 
portion of foreign corporate debt funds included as 
Level 3. Funds of funds 
There are no readily available market quotations for these funds. The fair value of the fund is based on 

NAVs of the funds in the portfolio, which reflects the 

value of the underlying securities. The fair value of 

the underlying securities is typically the amount that 
the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon 
selling those hard to value or illiquid securities within 
the portfolios. These funds are valued using 

unobservable inputs on a monthly basis and are 
included as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the fair value of each major category of plan assets as of Dec. 31, 2013 and

(ﬁESOPﬂ) covering certain domestic full-time employees with more than one year of service. The 
ESOP works in conjunction with the defined benefit 
pension plan. Employees are entitled to the higher of 

their benefit under the ESOP or such defined benefit 
pension plan at retirement. Benefits payable under 
the defined benefit pension plan are offset by the 
equivalent value of benefits earned under the ESOP. 
At Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2012, the ESOP owned 6.6 million and 6.9 million shares of our 

common stock, respectively.  The fair value of total 

ESOP assets was $236 million at Dec. 31, 2013 and 

$181 million at Dec. 31, 2012.  Contributions are 

made equal to required principal and interest 
payments on borrowings by the ESOP.  There were 

no contributions and no ESOP related expense in 

2013, 2012 or 2011. 
We have defined contribution plans, excluding the 
ESOP, for which we recognized a cost of $192 

million in 2013, $180 million in 2012 and $182 

million in 2011. 
The Benefits Investment Committee appointed Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. to serve as the 
independent fiduciary to (i) make certain fiduciary 
decisions related to the continued prudence of 
offering the common stock of BNY Mellon or its 

affiliates as an investment option under the plans 

other than with respect to plan sponsor decisions, and 
(ii) select and monitor any managed investments 
(active or passive, including mutual funds) of BNY 
Mellon or its affiliates to be offered to participants as 

investment options under the plans. BNY Mellon 183 
 (continued)Our bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend limitations under the Federal Reserve Act, as well as 

national and state banking laws. Under these statutes, 

prior regulatory consent is required for dividends in 
any year that would exceed the bank™s net profits for 

such year combined with retained net profits for the 
prior two years. Additionally, such bank subsidiaries 

may not declare dividends in excess of net profits on 
hand, as defined, after deducting the amount by 
which the principal amount of all loans, on which 
interest is past due for a period of six months or more, 
exceeds the allowance for credit losses. The payment of dividends also is limited by minimum capital requirements imposed on banks. As 

of Dec. 31, 2013, BNY Mellon™s bank subsidiaries 

exceeded these minimum requirements. Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2013, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 
approximately $2.9 billion without the need for a 

regulatory waiver.  In addition, at Dec. 31, 2013, non-

bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 
approximately $1.9 billion. 
The bank subsidiaries declared dividends of $1.0 
billion in 2013, $679 million in 2012 and $156 

million in 2011.  The Federal Reserve and the OCC 

have issued additional guidelines that require bank 
holding companies and national banks to continually 
evaluate the level of cash dividends in relation to 
their respective operating income, capital needs, asset 
quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy with respect to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding 
companies provides that, as a matter of prudent 
banking, a bank holding company should not 
maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net 
income available to common shareholders has been 
sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the 

prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be 
consistent with the holding company™s capital needs, 

asset quality and overall financial condition. The 

Federal Reserve can also prohibit a dividend if 
payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
banking practice. Any increase in BNY Mellon™s 

ongoing quarterly dividends would require approval 
from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve™s 

current guidance provides that, for large bank holding 

companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of projected after-tax net income will receive 

particularly close scrutiny. 
The Federal Reserve requires U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 
billion or more, like BNY Mellon, to submit annual 

capital plans for review.€ The Federal Reserve will 

evaluate the bank holding companies™ capital 

adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment 

processes, and their plans to make capital 
distributions, such as dividend payments or stock 
repurchases. BNY Mellon and other affected BHCs may pay 
dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital 
distributions only in accordance with a capital plan 
that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as 
to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The 

Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the 
plan does not show that the covered BHC will meet 
all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a 
ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 

of at least 5% on a 
pro forma 
basis under expected 
and stressful conditions throughout the nine-quarter 
planning horizon covered by the capital plan. The 

capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered BHC 
may not make a capital distribution unless after 
giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of 
Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets of at 

least 5%. As part of this process, BNY Mellon also 

provides the Federal Reserve with estimates of the 
composition and levels of regulatory capital, risk-
weighted assets and other measures under Basel III 
under an identified scenario. BNY Mellon™s most 

recent capital plan was submitted to the Federal 
Reserve on Jan. 6, 2014. The Federal Reserve has 

indicated that it expects to publish its objection or 
non-objection to the capital plan and proposed capital 
actions, such as dividend payments and share 
repurchases, on March 26, 2014. The Federal Reserve Act limits and requires collateral 
for extensions of credit by our insured subsidiary 
banks to BNY Mellon and certain of its non-bank 

affiliates.  Also, there are restrictions on the amounts 

of investments by such banks in stock and other 
securities of BNY Mellon and such affiliates, and 

restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as 
collateral for loans by such banks. Extensions of 

credit by the banks to each of our affiliates are limited 

to 10% of such bank™s regulatory capital, and in the 

aggregate for BNY Mellon and all such affiliates to 
 184 BNY Mellon 
 €€€€€€(continued) 20%, and collateral must be between 100% and 130% 
of the amount of the credit, depending on the type of 
collateral. Our insured subsidiary banks are required to maintain reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks under 
the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.  Required 

balances averaged $5.7 billion and $5.4 billion for the 

years 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
In the event of impairment of the capital stock of one of the Parent™s national banks or The Bank of New 

York Mellon, the Parent, as the banks™ stockholder, 

could be required to pay such deficiency. 
The Parent guarantees the debt issued by Mellon Funding Corporation, a wholly-owned financing 
subsidiary of the Company.  The Parent also 

guarantees committed and uncommitted lines of 
credit of Pershing LLC and Pershing Limited 
subsidiaries. The Parent guarantees described above 

are full and unconditional and contain the standard 
provisions relating to parent guarantees of subsidiary 
debt. Additionally, the Parent guarantees or 

indemnifies obligations of its consolidated 
subsidiaries as needed. Generally there are no stated 

notional amounts included in these indemnifications 
and the contingencies triggering the obligation for 
indemnification are not expected to occur.  As a 

result, we are unable to develop an estimate of the 
maximum payout under these indemnifications. 
However, we believe the possibility is remote that we 

will have to make any material payment under these 
guarantees and indemnifications. The Parent™s condensed financial statements are as 

follows:

The guidance related to ﬁFair Value Measurementﬂ 
included in ASC 820 defines fair value as the price 

that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to 
transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between 

market participants at the measurement date and 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value. It 

establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs 
to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the 
measurement date and expands the disclosures about 
instruments measured at fair value. ASC 820 requires 

consideration of a company™s own creditworthiness 

when valuing liabilities. The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly 
transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or 
distressed sale) between market participants at the 
measurement date under current market conditions. 
If there has been a significant decrease in the volume 
and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change 

in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation 
techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, 

determining the price at which willing market 
participants would transact at the measurement date 
under current market conditions depends on the facts 
and circumstances and requires the use of significant 
judgment. The objective is to determine from 

weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point 
within the range that is most representative of fair 
value under current market conditions. Determination of fair value 
Following is a description of our valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at 
fair value. We have established processes for 

determining fair values. Fair value is based upon 

quoted market prices in active markets, where 
available. For financial instruments where quotes 

from recent exchange transactions are not available, 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash 
flow analysis, comparison to similar instruments, and 
the use of financial models. Discounted cash flow 

analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash 
flows and the level of interest rates. Model-based 

pricing uses inputs of observable prices, where 
available, for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, 
option volatilities and other factors. Models are 

benchmarked and validated by an independent 
internal risk management function. Our valuation 

process takes into consideration factors such as 
counterparty credit quality, liquidity, concentration 

concerns, and observability of model parameters. 
Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that 

financial instruments are recorded at fair value. Most derivative contracts are valued using internally developed models which are calibrated to observable 
market data and employ standard market pricing  186 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) theory for their valuations. An initial ﬁrisk-neutralﬂ 
valuation is performed on each position assuming 
time-discounting based on a AA credit curve.  Then, 

to arrive at a fair value that incorporates counter-party 

credit risk, a credit adjustment is made to these results 
by discounting each trade™s expected exposures to the 

counterparty using the counterparty™s credit spreads, 

as implied by the credit default swap market. We also 

adjust expected liabilities to the counterparty using 
BNY Mellon™s own credit spreads, as implied by the 

credit default swap market. Accordingly, the 

valuation of our derivative position is sensitive to the 
current changes in our own credit spreads as well as 
those of our counterparties. In certain cases, recent prices may not be observable for instruments that trade in inactive or less active 
markets. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing 

financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we 
make an adjustment to their value. The determination 

of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of 
external quotes, the time since the latest available 
quote and the price volatility of the instrument. Certain parameters in some financial models are not directly observable and, therefore, are based on 
management™s estimates and judgments.  These 

financial instruments are normally traded less 
actively.  We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate 

the possibility of error and revision in the model 
based estimate value. Examples include products 

where parameters such as correlation and recovery 
rates are unobservable. The methods described above for instruments that trade in inactive or less active markets may produce a 
current fair value calculation that may not be 
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of 
future fair values. We believe our methods of 

determining fair value are appropriate and consistent 
with other market participants. However, the use of 

different methodologies or different assumptions to 

value certain financial instruments could result in a 
different estimate of fair value. 
Valuation hierarchy 

ASC 820 established a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset 
or liability as of the measurement date. The three 

levels are described below. 
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and 

liabilities include debt and equity securities and 
derivative financial instruments actively traded on 
exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities that are 

actively traded in highly liquid over-the-counter 

markets. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for example, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for 
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that 
are not active, and inputs that are observable or can 
be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for 

substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments 
that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded 
securities and derivative instruments whose model 
inputs are observable in the market or can be 
corroborated by market-observable data. Examples 

in this category are agency and non-agency 
mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities 
and over-the-counter derivative contracts. 
Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Examples in this category include 

certain private equity investments, derivative 
contracts that are highly structured or long-dated, and 
interests in certain securitized financial assets. A financial instrument™s categorization within the 
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair 
value, as well as the general classification of such 
instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
Securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of 
the valuation hierarchy.  Securities include both long 

and short positions. Level 1 securities include highly 

liquid government bonds, money market funds, 
foreign covered bonds and exchange-traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate fair values using pricing models, quoted prices of 
securities with similar characteristics or discounted BNY Mellon 187 
  (continued)cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which 
would generally be classified within Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy, include agency and non-agency 

mortgage-backed securities, state and political 
subdivisions, commercial mortgage-backed 
securities, sovereign debt, corporate bonds and 
foreign covered bonds. For securities where quotes from recent transactions are not available for identical securities, we determine 

fair value primarily based on pricing sources with 
reasonable levels of price transparency that employ 
financial models or obtain comparison to similar 
instruments to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2. 
Pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific 
security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 
price. In addition, we have significant investments in more actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 
securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 

observed trade price and other information feeds from 
the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 
information is included in the fair value assessment 
for such securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, we 
classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  Securities classified within Level 3 

primarily include securities of state and political 
subdivisions and distressed debt securities. At Dec. 31, 2013, more than 99% of our securities 
were valued by pricing sources with reasonable levels 
of price transparency.  Less than 1% of our securities 

were priced based on economic models and non-binding dealer quotes, and are included in Level 3 of 
the ASC 820 hierarchy.  
Consolidated collateralized loan obligations 
BNY Mellon values assets in consolidated CLOs 
using observable market prices observed from the 
secondary loan market. The returns to the note 

holders are solely dependent on the assets and 
accordingly equal the value of those assets. Based on 

the structure of the CLOs, the valuation of the assets 
is attributable to the senior note holders. Changes in 

the values of assets and liabilities are reflected in the 
income statement as investment and other income and 
interest of investment management fund note holders, 
respectively.  Consolidated CLOs are generally 

classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Derivatives 
We classify exchange-traded derivatives valued using 
quoted prices in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Examples include exchange-traded equity and foreign 
exchange options. Since few other classes of 

derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, most 
of our derivative positions are valued using internally 
developed models that use as their basis readily 
observable market parameters, and we classify them 
in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Such 

derivatives include swaps and options, foreign 
exchange spot and forward contracts and credit 
default swaps. Derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable market parameters in markets that lack 
two-way flow are classified in Level 3 of the 
valuation hierarchy.  Examples include long-dated 

interest rate or currency swaps and options, where 
parameters may be unobservable for longer 
maturities; and certain products, where correlation 
risk is unobservable. The fair value of these 

derivatives compose approximately 1% of our 

derivative financial instruments. Additional 

disclosures of derivative instruments are provided in 
Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments 

Where quoted market prices are not available, we generally base the fair value of loans and unfunded 
lending-related commitments on observable market 
prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit  188 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If 
observable market prices are not available, we base 
the fair value on estimated cash flows adjusted for 
credit risk which are discounted using an interest rate 
appropriate for the maturity of the applicable loans or 
the unfunded lending-related commitments. Unrealized gains and losses, if any, on unfunded 
lending-related commitments carried at fair value are 
classified in other assets and other liabilities, 
respectively.  Loans and unfunded lending-related 

commitments carried at fair value are generally 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Seed capital 
In our Investment Management business, we manage investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 
money market and alternative investment funds for 
institutions and other investors. As part of that 

activity, we make seed capital investments in certain 

funds. Seed capital is included in other assets. When 

applicable, we value seed capital based on the 
published NAV of the fund.  We include funds in 

which ownership interests in the fund are publicly 
traded in an active market and institutional funds in 
which investors trade in and out daily in Level 1 of 
the valuation hierarchy.  We include open-end funds 

where investors are allowed to sell their ownership 
interest back to the fund less frequently than daily 
and where our interest in the fund contains no other 
rights or obligations in Level 2 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  However, we generally include 

investments in funds that allow investors to sell their 
ownership interest back to the fund less frequently 
than monthly in Level 3, unless actual redemption 
prices are observable. For other types of investments in funds, we consider all of the rights and obligations inherent in our 
ownership interest, including the reported NAV as 

well as other factors that affect the fair value of our 

interest in the fund. To the extent the NAV 

measurements reported for the investments are based 
on unobservable inputs or include other rights and 
obligations (e.g., obligation to meet cash calls), we 
generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy. 
Certain interests in securitizations 
For certain interests in securitizations that are classified in securities available-for-sale, trading 

assets and long-term debt, we use discounted cash 
flow models, which generally include assumptions of 
projected finance charges related to the securitized 

assets, estimated net credit losses, prepayment 
assumptions and estimates of payments to third-party 
investors. When available, we compare our fair value 

estimates and assumptions to market activity and to 
the actual results of the securitized portfolio. Private equity investments 
Our Other segment includes holdings of nonpublic private equity investment through funds managed by 
third-party investment managers. We value private 

equity investments initially based upon the 
transaction price, which we subsequently adjust to 
reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing 
and sale transactions with third parties or through 
ongoing reviews by the investment managers. Private equity investments also include publicly held equity investments, generally obtained through the 
initial public offering of privately held equity 

investments. These equity investments are often held 

in a partnership structure. Publicly held investments 

are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less 
adjustments for regulatory or contractual sales 
restrictions or adjustments to reflect the difficulty in 

selling a partnership interest. Discounts for restrictions are quantified by analyzing the length of the restriction period and the volatility 
of the equity security.  Publicly held private equity 

investments are primarily classified in Level 2 of the 
valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the financial instruments carried at fair value at Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 

2012, by caption on the consolidated balance sheet 
and by ASC 820 valuation hierarchy (as described 

above). We have included credit ratings information 

in certain of the tables because the information 
indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are 
exposed, and significant changes in ratings 
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

    (continued) Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements 
Our classification of a financial instrument in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy is based on the significance 
of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value 
measurement. However, these instruments generally 

include other observable components that are actively 
quoted or validated to third-party sources; 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below 

include changes in fair value due to observable 
parameters as well as the unobservable parameters in 
our valuation methodologies. We also frequently 

manage the risks of Level 3 financial instruments 
using securities and derivatives positions that are 
Level 1 or 2 instruments which are not included in the table; accordingly, the gains or losses below do not 

reflect the effect of our risk management activities 

related to the Level 3 instruments. The Company has a Level 3 Pricing Committee which evaluates the valuation techniques used in 
determining the fair value of Level 3 assets and 
liabilities. The tables below include a roll forward of the balance sheet amounts for the years ended Dec. 31, 2013 and 

2012 (including the change in fair value), for 
financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the 
valuation hierarchy.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 

nonrecurring basis 
Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to fair value our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-
related commitments although they are not measured 
at fair value on an ongoing basis. An example would 

be the recording of an impairment of an asset. The following tables present the financial instruments 
carried on the consolidated balance sheet by caption 
and by level in the fair value hierarchy as of Dec. 31, 

2013 and Dec. 31, 2012, for which a nonrecurring 
change in fair value has been recorded during the 
years ended Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2012.

 (continued)Estimated fair value of financial instruments The carrying amounts of our financial instruments (i.e., monetary assets and liabilities) are determined 
under different accounting methods - see Note 1 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 

following disclosure discusses these instruments on a 
uniform fair value basis. However, active markets do 

not exist for a significant portion of these 
instruments. For financial instruments where quoted 

prices from identical assets and liabilities in active 
markets do not exist, we determine fair value based 
on discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to 
similar instruments. Discounted cash flow analysis is 

dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the 
level of interest rates. Other judgments would result 

in different fair values.  The assumptions used at Dec. 

31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2012 include discount rates 
ranging principally from 0.21% to 3.74%.  The fair 

value information supplements the basic financial 
statements and other traditional financial data 
presented throughout this report. A summary of the practices used for determining fair 
value and the respective level in the valuation 
hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities not 
recorded at fair value follows. Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks and interest-bearing deposits 

with banks The estimated fair value of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks is 
equal to the book value as these interest-bearing 
deposits are generally considered cash equivalents. 
These instruments are classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy.  The estimated fair value of 

interest-bearing deposits with banks is generally 
determined using discounted cash flows and duration 
of the instrument to maturity.  The primary inputs 

used to value these transactions are interest rates 
based on current LIBOR market rates and time to 
maturity.  Interest-bearing deposits with banks are 

classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements is based 
on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. Federal 

funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements are classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy. 
Securities held-to-maturity 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market for identical assets and liabilities, we classify the 
securities as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy.  

Securities are defined as both long and short 
positions. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury 

securities. If quoted market prices are not available for identical assets and liabilities, we estimate fair value using 
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with 
similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. 
Examples of such instruments, which would 
generally be classified as Level 2 within the valuation 
hierarchy, include certain agency and non-agency 

mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-
backed securities and state and political subdivision 
securities. For securities where quotes from active 

markets are not available for identical securities, we 
determine fair value primarily based on pricing 
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
that employ financial models or obtain comparison to 
similar instruments to arrive at ﬁconsensusﬂ prices. Specifically, the pricing sources obtain active market 
prices for similar types of securities (e.g., vintage, 
position in the securitization structure) and ascertain 
variables such as discount rate and speed of 
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy.  
Loans 
For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, adjusting where 
appropriate for prepayment estimates, using interest 
rates currently being offered for loans with similar 

terms and maturities to borrowers. The estimated fair 

value of margin loans and overdrafts is equal to the 

book value due to the short-term nature of these 
assets. The estimated fair value of other types of 

loans is determined using discounted cash flows. 
Inputs include current LIBOR market rates adjusted 
for credit spreads. These loans are generally 

classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
 198 BNY Mellon 
 (continued) Other financial assets Other financial assets include cash, the Federal Reserve Bank stock and accrued interest receivable. 
Cash is classified as Level 1 within the valuation 
hierarchy.  The Federal Reserve Bank stock is not 

redeemable or transferable. The estimated fair value 

of the Federal Reserve Bank stock is based on the 
issue price and is classified as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy.  Accrued interest receivable is 

generally short-term. As a result, book value is 

considered to equal fair value. Accrued interest 

receivable is included as Level 2 within the valuation 
hierarchy. 
Noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits 

Interest-bearing deposits are comprised of money market rate and demand deposits, savings deposits 
and time deposits. Except for time deposits, book 

value is considered to equal fair value for these 
deposits due to their short duration to maturity or 
payable on demand feature. The fair value of 

interest-bearing time deposits is determined using 
discounted cash flow analysis. Inputs primarily 

consist of current LIBOR market rates and time to 
maturity.  For all noninterest-bearing deposits, book 

value is considered to equal fair value as a result of 
the short duration of the deposit. Interest-bearing and 

noninterest-bearing deposits are classified as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy. 
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements is 
based on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. 
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy. 
Payables to customers and broker-dealers 
The estimated fair value of payables to customers and broker-dealers is equal to the book value, due to the 

demand feature of the payables to customers and 
broker-dealers, and are classified as Level 2 within 

the valuation hierarchy. 
Borrowings 

Borrowings primarily consist of overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Investment 
Services businesses, commercial paper and accrued 
interest payable. The estimated fair value of 

overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our 
Investment Services businesses is considered to equal 
book value as a result of the short duration of the 
overdrafts. Overdrafts are typically repaid within two 

days. The estimated fair value of our commercial 

paper is based on discount and duration of the 
commercial paper.  Our commercial paper matures 

within 397 days from date of issue and is not 

redeemable prior to maturity or subject to voluntary 
prepayment. Our commercial paper is included in 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Accrued interest 

payable is generally short-term. As a result, book 

value is considered to equal fair value. Accrued 

interest payable is included as Level 2 within the 
valuation hierarchy. 
Long-term debt 
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates for instruments of the same remaining 
maturity or quoted market prices for the same or 
similar issues. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2 
within the valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of financial instruments not 
carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet

BNY Mellon values assets in consolidated CLOs 

using observable market prices observed from the 
secondary loan market. The returns to the note 

holders are solely dependent on the assets and 
accordingly equal the value of those assets. 

market valuation best reflects the limited interest 
BNY Mellon has in the economic performance of the 

consolidated CLOs. Changes in the values of assets 

and liabilities are reflected in the income statement as 
investment income of consolidated investment 
management funds. We have elected the fair value option on $240 million 
of long-term debt in connection with ASC 810.  The 

fair value of this long-term debt was $321 million at 

Dec. 31, 2013 compared with $345 million at Dec. 

31, 2012. The long-term debt is valued using 

observable market inputs and is included in Level 2 
of the ASC 820 hierarchy. 
The following table presents the changes in fair value of the long-term debt included in foreign exchange

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are 
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management products, commercial lending commitments, letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce 
interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity 
needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate 
risks. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit, 

foreign currency and interest rate risk not recognized 
in the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are 

managed and monitored in manners similar to those 
used for on-balance sheet risks. Significant industry 

concentrations related to credit exposure at Dec. 31,

(b) Net of participations totaling $720 million at Dec. 31, 2013 

and $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. 
(c) Excludes the indemnification for securities booked at BNY 
Mellon beginning in late 2013 resulting from the CIBC 

Mellon joint venture, which totaled $60 billion at Dec. 31, 

2013. The balance at Dec. 31, 2012 excludes $66 billion of 

securities lending at the CIBC Mellon joint venture. 
Included in lending commitments are facilities that 
provide liquidity for variable rate tax-exempt 
securities wrapped by monoline insurers. The credit 

approval for these facilities is based on an assessment 
of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers 
factors other than the financial strength of the 
monoline insurer. 
The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments, standby and commercial letters of 
credit, and securities lending indemnifications is 
equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon, 
which does not consider the value of any collateral. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount 
does not necessarily represent future cash 
requirements. A summary of lending commitment 

maturities is as follows: $9.3 billion in less than one 

year, $24.6 billion in one to five years and $0.1 

billion over five years. 
Standby letters of credit (ﬁSBLCﬂ) principally support corporate obligations. As shown in the off-

balance sheet credit risks table, the maximum 
potential exposure of SBLCs was $6.7 billion at Dec. 

31, 2013 and $7.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2012, and 

includes $418 million and $781 million that were 

collateralized with cash and securities at Dec. 31, 

2013 and Dec. 31, 2012, respectively.  At Dec. 31, 
2013, $3.3 billion of the SBLCs will expire within 

one year and $3.4 billion in one to five years. 
We must recognize, at the inception of standby letters 
of credit and foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. As required by ASC 460 

Guarantees, the fair value of the liability, which was 
recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated liability for losses related to these commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the 
allowance for lending-related commitments. The 
allowance for lending-related commitments was $134 
million at Dec. 31, 2013 and $121 million at Dec. 31, 

2012. Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria. BNY Mellon™s historical experience is that 

SBLCs typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are monitored closely for payment/performance risk. The table below 
shows SBLCs by investment grade: Standby letters of credit Dec. 31, Dec. 31, 2013 2012 Investment grade 86% 93% Noninvestment grade 14% 7% A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term 
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for 
the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer.  

Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent 
upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it 
represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on 
the underlying transaction. As a result, the total 

contractual amounts do not necessarily represent 
future cash requirements. Commercial letters of 

credit totaled $310 million at Dec. 31, 2013 compared 

with $219 million at Dec. 31, 2012. 
A securities lending transaction is a fully 
collateralized transaction in which the owner of a 
security agrees to lend the security (typically through 
an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York 

Mellon), to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or 

bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under the 
terms of a prearranged contract, which normally 
matures in less than 90 days.  
 202 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) We typically lend securities with indemnification 
against borrower default. We generally require the 

borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value 
of 102% of the fair value of the securities borrowed, 

which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing 
credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities 

lending transactions. These risks are controlled 

through policies limiting the level of risk that can be 
undertaken. Securities lending transactions are 

generally entered into only with highly-rated 
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications 

were secured by collateral of $252 billion at Dec. 31, 

2013 and $253 billion at Dec. 31, 2012. 
CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon 
and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
(ﬁCIBCﬂ), engages in securities lending activities.€
CIBC Mellon, BNY Mellon, and CIBC jointly and 

severally indemnify securities lenders against specific 
types of borrower default.€At Dec. 31, 2013, $60 

billion of borrowings at CIBC Mellon booked at 

BNY Mellon beginning in late 2013 were secured by 

collateral of $64 billion.€ At Dec. 31, 2012, $66 

billion of borrowings at CIBC Mellon were secured 

by collateral of $70 billion.  If, upon a default, a 

borrower™s collateral was not sufficient to cover its 

related obligations, certain losses related to the 
indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors. We expect many of these guarantees to expire without 
the need to advance any cash. The revenue 

associated with guarantees frequently depends on the 
credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the 
transaction, including collateral, if any. 
Operating leases 
Net rent expense for premises and equipment was $335 million in 2013, $313 million in 2012 and $350 

million in 2011. 
At Dec. 31, 2013, we were obligated under various noncancelable lease agreements, some of which 
provide for additional rents based upon real estate 
taxes, insurance and maintenance and for various 
renewal options. A summary of the future minimum 

rental commitments under noncancelable operating 
leases, net of related sublease revenue, is as follows: 
2014Š$276 million; 2015Š$266 million; 2016Š 

$241 million; 2017Š$208 million; 2018Š$176 

million; and 2019 and thereafterŠ$733 million. 
Exposure for certain administrative errors 
In connection with certain funds that we manage, we may be liable to the funds for certain administrative 
errors. The errors relate to questions about the 

resident status of certain offshore tax exempt funds, 

potentially exposing the Company to a tax liability 
related to the funds™ earnings.  The Company is in 

discussions with tax authorities regarding the funds. 
In addition to amounts accrued, we believe it is 
reasonably possible that we could have a potential 
additional exposure of approximately $100 million. 
Indemnification Arrangements 

We have provided standard representations for 
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture 
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and 
other similar types of arrangements and customary 
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings 
related to providing financial services that are not 
otherwise included above. Insurance has been 

purchased to mitigate certain of these risks. 
Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts 

included in these indemnifications and the 
contingencies triggering the obligation for 
indemnification are not expected to occur.  

Furthermore, often counterparties to these 
transactions provide us with comparable 
indemnifications. We are unable to develop an 

estimate of the maximum payout under these 
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to 

the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority 
of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the 
nature of events that would trigger indemnification or 
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We 

believe, however, that the possibility that we will 

have to make any material payments for these 
indemnifications is remote. At Dec. 31, 2013 and 

Dec. 31, 2012, we have not recorded any material 
liabilities under these arrangements. Clearing and Settlement Exchanges 
We are a minority equity investor in, and/or member 
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges 
through which foreign exchange, securities, 
derivatives or other transactions settle. Certain of 

these industry clearing and settlement exchanges 
require their members to guarantee their obligations 
and liabilities or to provide financial support in the 
event other members do not honor their obligations. 
We believe the likelihood that a clearing or settlement 
BNY Mellon 203 
 (continued)exchange (of which we are a member) would become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain settlement 

exchanges have implemented loss allocation policies 
that enable the exchange to allocate settlement losses 
to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to 

quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss 
occurs. In addition, any ancillary costs that occur as a 

result of any mark-to-market loss cannot be 
quantified. At Dec. 31, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2012, we 

have not recorded any material liabilities under these 
arrangements. Legal proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and 
its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in 
or made parties to pending and potential legal actions 
and regulatory matters. Claims for significant 

monetary damages are often asserted in many of these 
legal actions, while claims for disgorgement, 

penalties and/or other remedial sanctions may be 
sought in regulatory matters. It is inherently difficult 

to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters 
given their complexity and the particular facts and 
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. 
However, on the basis of our current knowledge and 

understanding, we do not believe that judgments or 
settlements, if any, arising from these matters (either 

individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to 

applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have 
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 

position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they 

could have a material effect on net income in a given 

period. In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in litigation and regulatory matters, particularly 
where (i) the damages sought are substantial or 
indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early 
stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories 
or a large number of parties, as a matter of course 

there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the 
timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and 
regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss, 
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated 

with each such matter.  In accordance with applicable 

accounting guidance, BNY Mellon establishes 

accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when 
those matters proceed to a stage where they present 
loss contingencies that are both probable and 
reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a 

possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts 
accrued. BNY Mellon will continue to monitor such 
matters for developments that could affect the amount 

of the accrual, and will adjust the accrual amount as 
appropriate. If the loss contingency in question is not 

both probable and reasonably estimable, BNY Mellon 

does not establish an accrual and the matter will 
continue to be monitored for any developments that 
would make the loss contingency both probable and 
reasonably estimable. BNY Mellon believes that its 

accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, in 
the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated 
financial position of BNY Mellon, although future 

accruals could have a material effect on net income in 

a given period. For certain of those matters described herein for which a loss contingency may, in the future, be 

reasonably possible (whether in excess of a related 
accrued liability or where there is no accrued 
liability), BNY Mellon is currently unable to estimate 

a range of reasonably possible loss. For those matters 

where BNY Mellon is able to estimate a reasonably 

possible loss, the aggregate range of such reasonably 
possible loss is up to $730 million in excess of the 

accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon: 
Sentinel Matters As previously disclosed, on Jan. 18, 2008, The Bank 

of New York Mellon filed a proof of claim in the 

Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding of Sentinel 

Management Group, Inc. (ﬁSentinelﬂ) pending in 
federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, 
seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned 

to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an 
account maintained by Sentinel at The Bank of New 

York Mellon.  On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy 

trustee filed an adversary complaint against The Bank 

of New York Mellon seeking to disallow The Bank of 

New York Mellon™s claim and seeking damages for 

allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in 
misappropriating customer assets and improperly 
using those assets as collateral for the loan. In a 

decision dated Nov. 3, 2010, the court found for The 

Bank of New York Mellon and against the bankruptcy 

trustee, holding that The Bank of New York Mellon™s 

loan to Sentinel is valid, fully secured and not subject 
to equitable subordination. The bankruptcy trustee 

appealed this decision, and on Aug. 9, 2012, the 

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 

Circuit issued a decision affirming the trial court™s 

judgment. On Sept. 7, 2012, the bankruptcy trustee 
 204 BNY Mellon 
    (continued) filed a petition for rehearing on the fraudulent transfer portion of the opinion and, on Nov. 30, 2012, the 

Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion and vacated its 

judgment. On Aug. 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals 

reversed its own prior decision and the district court™s 

decision with respect to the bankruptcy trustee™s 

fraudulent transfer and equitable subordination claims 
and remanded the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements for additional information. As previously disclosed, in November 2009, the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Commodities 
Futures Trading Commission (ﬁCFTCﬂ) indicated that 

it is considering a recommendation to the CFTC that 
it file a civil enforcement action against The Bank of 

New York Mellon for possible violations of the 

Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations in 

connection with its relationship to Sentinel. The 

Bank of New York Mellon responded in writing to the 

CFTC on Jan. 29, 2010 and provided an explanation 
as to why an enforcement action is unwarranted. Securities Lending Matters As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon or its affiliates 

have been named as defendants in a number of 
lawsuits initiated by participants in BNY Mellon™s 

securities lending program, which is a part of BNY 
Mellon™s Investment Services business.  The lawsuits 

were filed on various dates from 2009 to 2013, and 

are currently pending in courts in New York, North 

Carolina and Illinois. The complaints assert 

contractual, statutory, and common law claims, 

including claims for negligence and breach of 
fiduciary duty.  The plaintiffs allege losses in 

connection with the investment of securities lending 
collateral, including losses related to investments in 
Sigma Finance Inc. (ﬁSigmaﬂ) and Lehman Brothers 
Holdings, Inc., and seek damages as to those losses. Foreign Exchange Matters As previously disclosed, beginning in December 
2009, government authorities have been conducting 
inquiries seeking information relating primarily to 
standing instruction foreign exchange transactions in 
connection with custody services BNY Mellon 

provides to public pension plans and certain other 
custody clients. BNY Mellon is cooperating with 

these inquiries. In addition, in early 2011, as previously disclosed, the 
Virginia Attorney General™s Office and the Florida 

Attorney General™s Office each intervened in a 
qui tam lawsuit pending in its jurisdiction, and, on Aug. 

11, 2011, filed superseding complaints.  On Nov. 9, 

2012, the Virginia court, which had previously 

dismissed all of the claims against BNY Mellon, 

dismissed the Virginia lawsuit with prejudice by 

agreement of the parties. On Nov. 18, 2013, the 

Florida Attorney General™s Office dismissed the 

Florida lawsuit with prejudice by agreement of the 
parties. On Oct. 4, 2011, the New York Attorney 

General™s Office, the New York City Comptroller and 

various city pension and benefit funds filed a lawsuit 
asserting, claims under the Martin Act and state and 

city false claims acts. On Aug. 5, 2013, the court 

dismissed the false claims act claims, and certain 
plaintiffs have since filed a notice of appeal.  Also, on 

Oct. 4, 2011, the United States Department of Justice 

(ﬁDOJﬂ) filed a civil lawsuit seeking civil penalties 
under 12 U.S.C. Section 1833a and injunctive relief 
under 18 U.S.C. Section 1345 based on alleged 
ongoing violations of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1341 and 
1343 (mail and wire fraud). On Jan. 17, 2012, the 

court approved a partial settlement resolving the 
DOJ™s claim for injunctive relief.  In October 2011, 

several public pension funds in the state of California 
purported to intervene in a qui tam lawsuit that was removed to federal district court in California. On 

March 30, 2012, the court dismissed certain of 
plaintiffs™ claims, including all claims under the 

California False Claims Act.  Certain plaintiffs have 

since filed an amended complaint. Several plaintiffs 

also had their claims dismissed for improper venue 
and one refiled on Sept. 5, 2012 in a different 

California federal district court. On Oct. 26, 2011, 

the Massachusetts Securities Division filed an 
Administrative Complaint against BNY Mellon, but 

closed the matter on Jan. 30, 2014 by agreement of 
the parties. BNY Mellon has also been named as a defendant in 
several putative class action federal lawsuits filed on 
various dates in 2011 and 2012.  The complaints, 

which assert claims including breach of contract and 
ERISA and securities laws violations, all allege that 

the prices BNY Mellon charged for standing 

instruction foreign exchange transactions executed in 
connection with custody services provided by BNY 
Mellon were improper.  In addition, BNY Mellon has 

been named as a nominal defendant in several 
derivative lawsuits filed in 2011 and 2012 in state and 

federal court in New York.  On July 2, 2013, the court 

in the consolidated federal derivative action 
dismissed all of plaintiffs™ claims, and plaintiffs have 

appealed that decision. On Oct. 1, 2013, the court in 
BNY Mellon 205 
      (continued)the consolidated state derivative action dismissed all of plaintiffs™ claims, and one of the plaintiffs filed a 

notice of appeal. BNY Mellon was also named in a 

qui tam lawsuit filed on May 22, 2012 in 
Massachusetts state court, but the court dismissed all 

of plaintiff™s claims on Sept. 10, 2013. To the extent 

these lawsuits are pending in federal court, they are 
being coordinated for pre-trial purposes in federal 
court in New York. 
Lyondell Litigation 
As previously disclosed, in an action filed in New 
York State Supreme Court for New York County, on 

Sept. 14, 2010, plaintiffs as holders of debt issued by 

Basell AF in 2005 allege that The Bank of New York 

Mellon, as indenture trustee, breached its contractual 
and fiduciary obligations by executing an 
intercreditor agreement in 2007 in connection with 
Basell™s acquisition of Lyondell Chemical Company.  

Plaintiffs sought damages for their alleged losses 

resulting from the execution of the 2007 intercreditor 
agreement that allowed the company to increase the 
amount of its senior debt. After its motion to dismiss 

was denied in part, BNY Mellon appealed the denial.  

On May 21, 2013, the appellate court found in our 
favor and held that BNY Mellon had been released 

from liability.  Plaintiffs then sought leave to pursue 

an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, but that 

court denied plaintiffs™ motion on Dec. 17, 2013. 
Tax Litigation 
As previously disclosed, on Aug. 17, 2009, BNY 

Mellon received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency 
disallowing tax benefits for the 2001 and 2002 tax 
years in connection with a 2001 transaction that 
involved the payment of UK corporate income taxes 
that were credited against BNY Mellon™s  U.S. 

corporate income tax liability.  On Nov. 10, 2009, 

BNY Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

contesting the disallowance of the benefits. Trial was 

held from April 16 to May 17, 2012.  On Feb. 11, 

2013, the Tax Court upheld the IRS™s Notice of 

Deficiency and disallowed BNY Mellon™s tax credits 

and associated transaction costs.€On Sept. 23, 2013, 

the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, partially 

reducing the tax implications to BNY Mellon of its 

earlier decision.€The Tax Court entered its Decision, 

which formally implemented its prior opinions and 
rulings, on Feb. 20, 2014. BNY Mellon will appeal.  

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information. Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceeding 

As previously disclosed, The Bank of New York 

Mellon as trustee is the petitioner in a legal 
proceeding filed in New York State Supreme Court, 

New York County on June 29, 2011, seeking approval 

of a proposed settlement involving Bank of America 

Corporation and bondholders in certain Countrywide 
residential mortgage-securitization trusts.  The New 

York and Delaware Attorneys General have 

intervened in this proceeding. The trial in this matter 

ended on Nov. 21, 2013.  On Jan. 31, 2014, the court 

issued its decision approving the settlement except to 
the extent that it releases loan modification claims. 
The court approved all the other terms of the 
settlement. Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford 
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC became a 
clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (ﬁSGCﬂ), a 
registered broker dealer that was part of a group of 
entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford.  

Stanford International Bank (ﬁSIBﬂ), also controlled 
by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit (ﬁCDsﬂ). 
Some investors allegedly wired funds from their SGC 
accounts to purchase CDs. In 2009, the SEC charged 

Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection 
with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into 
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have four 

pending lawsuits against Pershing in Texas.  In 

addition, alleged purchasers have filed twenty-seven 

FINRA arbitration claims against Pershing in Texas, 

Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia.  The 

purchasers allege that Pershing, as SGC™s clearing 

firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent scheme, and 
assert contractual, statutory and common law claims. 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk 
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and 
foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our 

trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers and facilitating customer 
trades. In addition, we periodically manage positions 

for our own account. Positions managed for our own 

account are immaterial to our foreign exchange and 
other trading revenue and to our overall results of 
operations. The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments express the dollar volume of the 
transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.  

We perform credit reviews and enter into netting 
 206 BNY Mellon 
  (continued) agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We 

enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to 

foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risk. 
Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty 

to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a 
risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative 
contract. Counterparty default losses were $2.1 

million in 2013 and less than $1 million in 2012. 
Hedging derivatives We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For hedges 

of available-for-sale investment securities, deposits 

and long-term debt, the hedge documentation 
specifies the terms of the hedged items and the 
interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is 
hedging a fixed rate item and is a fair value hedge, 
that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item due to changes in 
benchmark interest rates, and that the strategy is to 
eliminate fair value variability by converting fixed-
rate interest payments to LIBOR. The available-for-sale investment securities hedged 
consist of sovereign debt, U.S. Treasury bonds, 

agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and 
covered bonds that had original maturities of 30 years 

or less at initial purchase. The swaps on all of these 

investment securities are not callable. All of these 

securities are hedged with ﬁpay fixed rate, receive 
variable rateﬂ swaps of similar maturity, repricing and 

fixed rate coupon. At Dec. 31, 2013, $6.4 billion face 

amount of securities were hedged with interest rate 
swaps that had notional values of $6.6 billion. 
The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally have original maturities of five to 30 years.  

We issue both callable and non-callable debt.  The 

non-callable debt is hedged with simple interest rate 
swaps similar to those described for deposits. 
Callable debt is hedged with callable swaps where the 
call dates of the swaps exactly match the call dates of 
the debt. At Dec. 31, 2013, $14.8 billion par value of 

debt was hedged with interest rate swaps that had 
notional values of $14.8 billion. 
In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges. 
We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 

maturities of nine months or less to hedge our British 
Pound, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee and 

Singapore Dollar foreign exchange exposure with 
respect to foreign currency forecasted revenue and 
expense transactions in entities that have the U.S. 
dollar as their functional currency.  As of Dec. 31, 

2013, the hedged forecasted foreign currency 
transactions and designated forward foreign exchange 
contract hedges were $185 million (notional), with a 

pre-tax gain of $7 million recorded in accumulated 

other comprehensive income. This gain will be 

reclassified to income or expense over the next nine 

months. We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 
remaining maturities of nine months or less as hedges 
against our foreign exchange exposure to Australian 

Dollar, Euro, Swedish Krona, British Pound, Danish 

Krone, Norwegian Krone and Japanese Yen with 

respect to interest-bearing deposits with banks and 
their associated forecasted interest revenue. These 

hedges are designated as cash flow hedges. These 

hedges are effected such that their maturities and 

notional values match those of the deposits with 
banks. As of Dec. 31, 2013, the hedged interest-

bearing deposits with banks and their designated 
forward foreign exchange contract hedges were $1.6 

billion (notional), with a pre-tax gain of less than $1 

million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 

income. This gain will be reclassified to net interest 

revenue over the next nine months. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of our net investments in foreign 
subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange 

contracts have maturities of less than two years.  The 

derivatives employed are designated as hedges of 
changes in value of our foreign investments due to 
exchange rates. Changes in the value of the forward 

foreign exchange contracts offset the changes in value 

of the foreign investments due to changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The change in fair market value of 

these forward foreign exchange contracts is deferred 
and reported within accumulated translation 
adjustments in shareholders™ equity, net of tax.  At 

Dec. 31, 2013, forward foreign exchange contracts 
with notional amounts totaling $5.6 billion were 

designated as hedges. BNY Mellon 207

Trading activities (including trading derivatives) 
We manage trading risk through a system of position 
limits, a VaR methodology based on Monte Carlo 
simulations, stop loss advisory triggers, and other market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and 
reported to senior management by a separate unit on a 
daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR 
methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions. The calculation 
assumes a one-day holding period for most instruments, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and 
incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options. The VaR model is one of several statistical models 
used to develop economic capital results, which is allocated to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted performance. As the VaR methodology does not evaluate risk 
attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences, the risk assessment process 
includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the 
risk factors in the portfolio and management™s 

assessment of market conditions. Additional stress 

scenarios based upon historic market events are also 
performed. Stress tests, by their design, incorporate 

the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of 
observed correlations. The results of these stress tests 

are reviewed weekly with senior management. Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading

in the form of cash or highly liquid government

adjusted daily. 
Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 20 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter 
(ﬁOTCﬂ) derivative instruments Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements of The Bank of New York Mellon, our 

largest banking subsidiary and the subsidiary through 

which BNY Mellon enters into the substantial 

majority of all of its OTC derivative contracts and/or 
collateral agreements, contain provisions that may 
require us to take certain actions if The Bank of New 

York Mellon™s public debt rating fell to a certain 

level. Early termination provisions, or ﬁclose-outﬂ 

agreements, in those contracts could trigger 
immediate payment of outstanding contracts that are 
in net liability positions. Certain collateral 

agreements would require The Bank of New York 

Mellon to immediately post additional collateral to 
cover some or all of The Bank of New York Mellon™s 

liabilities to a counterparty. 
The following table shows the fair value of contracts 
falling under early termination provisions that were in 
net liability positions as of Dec. 31, 2013 for three 

key ratings triggers: If The Bank of New York Mellon™s rating was changed toPotential€close-out (Moody™s/S&P) exposures€(fair€value) 
(a) A3/A-$ 110 million 
Baa2/BBB $ 745 million 
Bal/BB+ $ 1,849 million 
(a) The amounts represent potential total close-out values if The 
Bank of New York Mellon™s rating were to immediately drop 

to the indicated levels. The aggregated fair value of contracts impacting 
potential trade close-out amounts and collateral 
obligations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due 
to changes in market conditions, changes in the 
composition of counterparty trades, new business, or 
changes to the agreement definitions establishing 
close-out or collateral obligations. Additionally, if The Bank of New York Mellon™s debt 
rating had fallen below investment grade on Dec. 31, 

2013, existing collateral arrangements would have 
required us to have posted an additional $430 million 

of collateral. Offsetting assets and liabilities 
The following tables present derivative instruments and financial instruments that are either subject to an 
enforceable netting agreement or offset by collateral 

arrangements. There were no derivative instruments 

or financial instruments subject to a netting

revenue transferred between businesses under 
revenue transfer agreements is included within 
other revenue in each business. Ł Revenues and expenses associated with specific client bases are included in those businesses. For 

example, foreign exchange activity associated 
with clients using custody products is allocated to 
Investment Services. Ł Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on the yields on the assets and liabilities 
generated by each business. We employ a funds 

transfer pricing system that matches funds with 
the specific assets and liabilities of each business 
based on their interest sensitivity and maturity 
characteristics. Ł Incentive expense related to restricted stock and certain corporate overhead charges are allocated 

to the businesses. Ł Support and other indirect expenses are allocated to businesses based on internally-developed 
methodologies. Ł Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses based on average deposits generated 
within each business. Ł Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business in which the charge occurs. 
Ł Management of the investment securities portfolio is a shared service contained in the 
Other segment. As a result, gains and losses 

associated with the valuation of the securities 
portfolio are included in the Other segment. Ł Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our investment securities portfolio. 
We typically allocate all interest revenue to the 

businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, 

accretion related to the portion of the investment 
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been 
included in the results of the businesses. Ł M&I expense is a corporate level item and is recorded in the Other segment. Ł Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, restructuring charges were recorded in the

The Board of Directors and Shareholders The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 
and€subsidiaries (ﬁBNY Mellonﬂ) as of December€31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of 

income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 

ended December€31, 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of BNY Mellon™s 

management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 

evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of BNY Mellon as of December€31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their 

cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December€31, 2013, in conformity with 
U.S.€generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States), BNY Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting as of December€31, 2013, based on criteria 

established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an 

unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of BNY Mellon™s internal control over financial reporting.
