 DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS 
I am pleased to report that our performance in 2012 yielded positive returns to our shareholders against a 
challenging and uncertain economic backdrop. Persistent low interest rates, low volatility and tepid capital 

markets continued to weigh on the global markets, the ˜nancial industry and our company. In spite of the 

environment, we were able to make signi˜cant progress transforming our company both operationally and 

culturally, and are now more nimble, client-focused and results-oriented. We are equipped to contribute to 

the smooth and orderly functioning of the global markets, a signi˜cant responsibility that we embrace. 
Let me highlight some important measures we use to gauge our performance: 
 SHAREHOLDER RETURN: In 2012, our total shareholder return was 32 percent, positioning us at 
the 75
th percentile relative to both the S&P 500 Financials Index and our peer group. This is a vast 
improvement over our prior-year results. This improvement needs to continue in order to deliver 
a more consistent return, as we still lag our peers and the Index over a three-year and ˜ve-year 
horizon. 
 BOOK VALUE: 
The growth in the intrinsic value of our ˜rm is not always immediately re˚ected in 
our share price. One of the best measures of whether we are increasing the long-term value of our 

company is to examine the growth in our book value. As of year-end our book value per share was 
$30.39 compared to $27.62, a 10 percent improvement over 2011. 
 RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY: 
This re˚ects the earnings we achieved on the equity in 
the business. While we achieved a very healthy return of 19.3 percent
i in 2012, it was down from 
22.6 percent
i in 2011, as earnings were essentially ˚at and our equity base grew. 
 EARNINGS PER SHARE: We earned the same as in 2011, $2.03 per share, which was 89 percent of 
budget. Much of the shortfall to budget was attributable to weak markets and the settlement of a 
number of signi˜cant litigation items. 
We also continued to receive top rankings for client satisfaction and industry recognition for investment 
performance, measures that help differentiate our brand and drive organic growth. 
Among the notable accomplishments in 2012, we: 
 
 
   
 
  
 
   
   
  $600 million in common stock dividends. 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
      
 
 
  
 
  
  
 pre-tax gain and a credit to our provision for credit losses of $80 million. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
       
 
  
    
 
  
 
 
   
       ratio was 9.8 percent.
i,ii A DISTINCTIVE, ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL 
To understand why we are a good investment, one needs to understand what makes our business model 
distinctive and attractive. 
We are the investments company for the world. We are completely focused on the investment process Œ 
managing and servicing global ˜nancial assets. No other company can match our singular focus on invest˛

ments in every dimension. Among other things, we are paid recurring fees to manage assets for institutions 

and individuals through our Investment Management boutiques and Wealth Management offerings, as well 

as administer, monitor and report on those client assets through our Investment Services capabilities Œ 

all while taking very little credit risk. It is a role that has enabled us to take on some of the world™s most 

complex issues coming out of the ˜nancial crisis, and help solve them. 
I  


  


  


  
   
 

  
 

  
  
 


  
   






 

    


   Our businesses generate deposits and earn a return on them, though less than in the past in this low-rate 
environment. We are relied upon to be a trusted manager and/or advisor and holder of ˜nancial assets, a 

role that is enhanced by our capital strength, stability and narrow risk appetite. 
What makes our business model attractive? I can give a number of reasons: 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 solutions to many of the most advanced and complex ˜nancial companies and investors globally. 
 
 
 
  
 
    
  
 
  
 throughout our company. 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
 
    capita GDP growth. The globalization of the ˜nancial markets and cross-border ˚ows favor us 
as well. Those assets all need to be managed and/or serviced. 
  
 
 
  
  
    
 
  
   
 recurring fees, underscoring our relative consistency of earnings. 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 through dividends and share buybacks, as growing our business does not require growth in 

risk-weighted assets and the capital to support them. 
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
  
 
 from improvements in interest rates, capital markets activity, volatility and debt issuance. 
We don™t need all of these to occur; any one of them will have a positive impact on us. 
REVIEWING OUR PERFORMANCE 
Our core businesses remain strong. Let me review a few highlights: 
INVESTMENT SERVICES
 Œ Assets under custody and/or administration totaled $26.2 trillion at the end of 
2012. Many of the key drivers of our Investment Services businesses showed signi˜cant improvement over 

2011. Average long-term mutual fund assets grew 9 percent, average collateral management balances 

were up 8 percent and average total Investment Services deposits were up 11 percent. However, partially 

  
 
 
 
   
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
 manage the collateral they are now required to post against various trading positions and counterparties. 
This is an important development that demonstrates the power of our investments model. We are both 
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
   
˛eral management, derivatives, liquidity services and securities ˜nancing capabilities, we are distinctively 
positioned to create an end-to-end solution for clients™ growing collateral needs. 
In asset servicing, we implemented a new client service model designed to align our services against 
speci˜c client needs or attributes. This will help ensure that we™re providing the appropriate solutions 

to meet those needs and start us on the path to improving the core pro˜tability of this business. 
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
 Œ Our Investment Management business remained committed to delivering 
strong investment performance and outstanding wealth management capabilities for our clients. Our 

  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  re˚ecting 13 consecutive quarters of positive net long-term ˚ows. Wealth Management average loans 
  
  
  
   
 
 We continued to invest in building our investment and distribution capabilities, with a particular focus 
on the Asia Paci˜c region. Our distinctive investment capabilities, such as our liability-driven investment 

strategies, were in strong demand with our clients. Wealth Management also had another extremely 

successful year, attaining record levels across multiple dimensions, including assets under management, 

revenues, deposits and client satisfaction scores. 
II  







  









 

  OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 
We are focused on a clear set of strategic priorities that support our goals of powering global investments 
to help our clients succeed and delivering consistent earnings-per-share growth. They include: 
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
   
 
  
   
     
 Let me highlight our progress in these areas. 
Creating Organic Growth 
We are not standing still waiting for the markets to improve. We have a relentless focus on creating 

organic growth, re˚ecting our history of leadership in anticipating and adapting to change, capitalizing on 

the good ideas generated by our global staff in support of our clients. We have continuously expanded and 

innovated to address future market needs Œ whether by pioneering the ˜rst tri-party repo trade in collabo˛

ration with a large client, introducing the ˜rst worldwide U.S. dollar money market fund or launching the 

˜rst mobile investment services applications. 
EXPANDING OUR CAPABILITIES 
Œ Key areas of focus include accelerating our Asset Management growth 
strategies, particularly in Asia and for retail distribution; capturing opportunities through our Global 

   
  
 
  
   
 out our Global Markets business to capture more order ˚ow. 
Our clients™ needs are complex and single-product solutions are insuf˜cient. Our focus, therefore, is on 
tapping into our broad range of products to deliver innovative, value-added client solutions. We have 

formed a Strategic Growth Initiatives team to identify future growth opportunities, and we™ve taken steps 

to embed in our company a culture of collaboration and innovation. 
Together, these efforts will help drive our long-term growth, so they are wise investments in our future. 

BUILDING A GLOBAL PRESENCE
 Œ We are making progress in expanding globally. Our purchase of the 

  
 
  
 
 
 
  
    
 
 
 Meriten Investment Management Œ has increased our exposure to Germany, where we have also become 
the No. 1 custody provider, evidencing our success in this important market. We recently received approval 

 
  
  
  
    
    
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
     
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
    
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 INVESTED IN OUR CLIENTS Œ SHARPENING CLIENT FOCUS AND STRENGTHENING BRAND LOYALTY 
The enhanced client management model we introduced over the past two years, which better aligns our 

resources with client needs, is already achieving success. After one year of experience, we were able to 

offer more solution sets, helping us achieve a measurable increase in business with some of our largest 

clients. We continue to expand the model to include additional complex global clients and to realign our 

front end to create full-service teams focused on speci˜c clients, market segments and regions. Our cli˛

ents appreciate and value this approach, and it will yield increasingly positive results for us in the future. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 to award us new and higher-value mandates and serve as terri˜c references. This year, we are focused 
on expanding our programs to measure and strengthen client loyalty, adopting consistent measurement 
practices across the company that will help us identify opportunities for continuously improving the 
client experience. 
III 

    






             Driving Excellence Throughout Our Organization 

   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
   
 you the operational excellence initiatives we were undertaking to deliver the highest service quality, 
reduce operational risk, increase margins and allow us to move new capabilities to market more quickly. 

We are making excellent progress, and are on track to realize roughly $650 million to $700 million in ex˛

pense savings by 2015 while we improve risk management, productivity and quality across the company. 
Within Investment Services, we are simplifying our operating/service delivery platforms. Our asset servic˛
ing business is a prime area of opportunity. More than a year ago we launched a program to transform this 

business to improve our margins and pro˜tability while strengthening the client experience. We are in the 

process of reengineering our organizational structure and processes to gain productivity and increase 

service levels. We also have made progress in more fully leveraging our global delivery centers in locations 

with improved cost dynamics and access to a deep talent pool. In 2012 we once again received top rank˛

ings in the key global custody surveys, testament to our success in maintaining our focus on quality 

of service throughout the transformation. 
Deploying Capital and Managing Risk Wisely 
Our fee-based business model allows us to generate a signi˜cant level of capital rapidly. During 2012 

we generated $2.7 billion in tangible capital. The combination of our rapid capital generation and quality 

balance sheet has enabled us to strengthen our key capital ratios and return capital to our shareholders. 

Acquisitions remain a low priority, as we see better opportunities for organic growth. We expect to use 
  
 
   
 
   
  
 
 
 
 return capital to our shareholders. 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  risk appetite for their business, anticipate risk and escalate issues quickly. This is fundamental to our 
reputation and performance. 
INVESTED IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
The work we do matters. We play a vital role in the global ˜nancial markets, enabling the market to 

ef˜ciently allocate capital by providing an infrastructure that facilitates the movement of cash and 

securities through the markets. Our purpose is to power global investments to help our clients succeed. 
As a global systemically important ˜nancial institution, we understand the critical function we perform 
for the marketplace, and embrace our leadership responsibility in terms of capital strength, liquidity, risk 

management and integrity. 
Our work with regulators and clients to reduce signi˜cantly the risks associated with the secured 
intraday credit we provide in the tri-party market is a powerful example of our role in setting standards 

for the industry in reforming critical elements of the capital markets infrastructure. 
We also must be incredibly reliable and resilient, no matter the circumstances. Superstorm Sandy tested 
our resilience, impacting a number of key operations centers and thousands of employees, yet we 

provided continuity of service throughout. Many clients told us, ﬁThank you. You were really there for us.ﬂ 

We invested in business continuity planning, and it was money well spent. 
INVESTED IN OUR WORLD 
We take great pride in what we do, but also acknowledge the great responsibility we bear. We are respon˛

sible for delivering for our clients, who entrust us with their business and most valuable assets. We are 

responsible for empowering our employees, who deliver for our clients every day in ways that are truly 

amazing. We are accountable for creating a work environment that allows our employees to make 

contributions to our success and to build ful˜lling careers. We are also obliged to honor our heritage, 

those before us who founded and built our ˜rm and recognized our company™s responsibility to support 

our communities. It is a tradition we uphold to this day as an employer, taxpayer and supporter of 

agencies, programs, our communities and people less fortunate than ourselves. 
IV   

   












 


   






During 2012, we saw the bene˜ts of our investments in building and supporting a strong culture, as 
employment engagement scores increased and more employees created development plans to advance 

their skills and prepare them for the next stages of their careers and to deliver greater value to our clients. 

We recognize that more diverse and inclusive organizations are better at innovating, driving revenue 

growth and performing for shareholders. We are pleased to report that more than half our most senior 

appointments at the company this past year involved women and candidates with diverse backgrounds 

and characteristics. 

   
 
 
   
  
   
  
 contributions, while sharpening our focus on areas where we have the greatest impact. Following Super-
storm Sandy our company and our employees invested in direct disaster relief, and many of our people 

participated in volunteer efforts in the long weeks that followed. Our emphasis on vulnerable youth, such 

as youth aging out of foster care in the U.S. and older girls in orphanages in India, is producing signi˜cant 

improvements in the lives of these individuals. 
LOOKING FORWARD 
We are a stronger company than we were a year ago. We have continued to grow core investment 

management and many of our investment services fees, re˚ecting the strength of our business model. 

We are investing in our future and have funded numerous initiatives that should yield positive results 

for our businesses. 
We also implemented a series of organizational and leadership changes effective January 1, 2013, to 
drive the execution of our priorities and increase the depth of our leadership team. Karen Peetz became 

President and is focusing on the ˜rst pillar of our company, our clients and employees. She is oversee˛

ing client management, the regions, innovation, employee training and development and some of our key 

 
     
 
   
    
 
 
 and President, respectively, of all these businesses, bringing together all our capabilities under one lead˛

 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
     
   
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 It, too, is an area with great upside as our investment performance and capabilities are increasingly 
recognized throughout the world. 
These leadership changes already have energized the company in ways that will accelerate growth 
opportunities and drive higher levels of productivity, quality and performance. 

  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
     
 
  
  
  
   
 
  the marketplace of the scope of our capabilities, we can be more successful. Stronger brands tend to gen˛
erate stronger shareholder returns. You will hear more about our efforts in this area over the coming year. 
We have nearly 50,000 employees in markets throughout the world who put investors at the center of 

 
 
 
 
  
 
       
 
 
 for their extraordinary level of energy and commitment. 
I also would like to thank our board of directors for their support and wise counsel. They appropriately 
challenge us every day to be a better company, and I am deeply appreciative of their contributions. They 

share my conviction that we have a powerful business model, the right strategy and an exceptional team 

to help our clients succeed and deliver consistent earnings per share growth and attractive returns to you, 

our shareholders.

BNY Mellon 3 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations General In this Annual Report, references to “our,” “we,” “us,” 
“BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and similar terms 
refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 
and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term “Parent” 
refers to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 

but not its subsidiaries. 
BNY Mellon’s actual results of future operations may 
differ from those estimated or anticipated in certain 
forward-looking statements contained herein for 

reasons which are discussed below and under the 

heading “Forward-looking Statements.” When used in 

this Annual Report, words such as “estimate,” 

“forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “confident,” 

“target,” “expect,” “intend,” “continue,” “seek,” 

“believe,” “plan,” “goal,” “could,” “should,” “may,” 

“will,” “strategy,” “synergies,” “opportunities,” 

“trends,” and words of similar meaning, signify 
forward-looking statements in addition to statements 
specifically identified as forward-looking statements. 
Certain business terms used in this document are 
defined in the Glossary. 
The following should be read in conjunction with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 
Annual Report. Investors should also read the section 
titled “Forward-looking Statements.” 
How we reported results 

All information for 2012 and 2011 in this Annual 
Report is reported on a net income basis. All 

information for 2010 in this Annual Report is reported 

on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise 

noted. For a description of discontinued operations, 
see Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Throughout this Annual Report, measures, which are 
noted as “Non-GAAP financial measures,” exclude 
certain items. BNY Mellon believes that these 
measures are useful to investors because they permit a 
focus on period-to-period comparisons using 
measures that relate to our ability to enhance revenues 
and limit expenses in circumstances where such 

matters are within our control. We also present the net 

interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) 

basis. We believe that this presentation allows for 

comparison of amounts arising from both taxable and 

tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry 
practice. Certain immaterial reclassifications have 
been made to prior periods to place them on a basis 
comparable with the current period presentation. See 

“Supplemental information – Explanation of Non-

GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 106 for 

a reconciliation of financial measures presented in 

accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 

principles (“GAAP”) to adjusted Non-GAAP financial 

measures. Reporting of assets under custody and/or 
administration In connection with context we provide in 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) for 
our Investment Servicing business, we disclose assets 

under custody (“AUC”) combined with assets under 

administration (“AUA”, and together, “AUC/A”). In 

January 2013, during a review of our processes and 

procedures for reporting AUC/A, we discovered that 

the extraction and collection of these metrics had 

certain flaws that resulted in the reporting of incorrect 

amounts. The data extraction process that resulted in 

these reporting errors is used exclusively for reporting 
AUC/A and is unrelated to and, therefore, had no 
impact on client accounts, assets and statements. Our 
subsequent review (our “Review”) showed that data 
was extracted in a manner that caused (i) a double-
counting of certain categories of primarily AUC, 
(ii) an under-counting and certain misclassifications of 
AUA, and (iii) the use of the original principal 
balance rather than the amortized principal balance of 

certain fixed income securities. AUC, AUA and 

AUC/A typically are contained in certain bank 

regulatory filings, SEC filings and other materials. 
Our AUC/A for Dec. 31, 2012, as reported in this 
Annual Report, and as a result of our Review, is $26.2 

trillion, $0.5 trillion less than the $26.7 trillion that 

was reported in our earnings release for the fourth 

quarter of 2012 on a preliminary basis. The decrease 

from the preliminary AUC/A reported in our earnings 

release reflects the reduction of $0.5 trillion of 

double-counted AUC/A (in addition to the $1.3 

trillion doubled-counted AUC/A that was reflected 
preliminarily in our earnings release disclosure), the 
addition of $0.7 trillion of under-counted AUA, and 
the reduction of $0.7 trillion due to principal 
extraction errors described above. The adjustments to 
AUC/A resulted in a year-over-year growth rate of 4% 
versus a previously reported year-over-year 
preliminary growth rate of 9% in our earnings release 

for the fourth quarter of 2012. AUC/A included in this 
BNY Mellon 4 Results of Operations (continued) Annual Report has been revised for the years ended 
2010, 2011 and 2012. See the “Financial Summary” 

beginning on page 2. As a result of our Review, in the 

Glossary of this Annual Report we have clarified our 

definition of AUC/A. 
As a result of these errors, we are seeking to 
streamline and enhance the data collection processes 

and systems relating to AUC/A. We also have 

commenced a review of the process for reporting 

other information in our public filings and have begun 

and will continue to correct and enhance our 

disclosure policies and procedures going forward. 
The data extraction errors relating to AUC/A did not 
impact our reported financial condition or results of 

operations, including our revenues, earnings or capital 

ratios and are unrelated to our internal control over 

financial reporting. 
Overview 
BNY Mellon is the corporate brand of The Bank of 
New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE symbol: BK). 

BNY Mellon is a global investments company 

dedicated to helping its clients manage and service 

their financial assets throughout the investment 

lifecycle. Whether providing financial services for 

institutions, corporations or individual investors, BNY 

Mellon delivers informed investment management 

and investment services in 36 countries and more than 

100 markets. As of Dec. 31, 2012, BNY Mellon had 

$26.2 trillion in assets under custody and/or 

administration, and $1.4 trillion in assets under 

management. BNY Mellon can act as a single point of 

contact for clients looking to create, trade, hold, 

manage, service, distribute or restructure investments. 
BNY Mellon’s businesses benefit from the global 
growth in financial assets and from the globalization 

of the investment process. Over the long term, our 

goals are focused on deploying capital to accelerate 

the long-term growth of our businesses and achieving 

superior total returns to shareholders by generating 

first quartile earnings per share growth over time 

relative to a group of peer companies. 
Key components of our strategy include: 
Š focusing on organic growth opportunities; 
Š providing superior client service versus peers; 
Š delivering strong investment performance 
relative to benchmarks; 
Š generating above-median revenue growth 

relative to peer companies; 
Š increasing the percentage of revenue and income 

derived from outside the United States; 
Š maintaining a highly liquid balance sheet with 

excellent credit quality; 
Š improving efficiency and reducing operational 

risk; and 
Š disciplined capital deployment. 
We have established Basel I Tier 1 capital as our 

principal capital measure and have established a 

targeted ratio of Basel I Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted 

assets of 10%. We expect to update our capital targets 

once new regulatory capital guidelines are finalized. 
Key 2012 and subsequent events Sale of private client business 
On Feb. 27, 2013, Newton Management Limited, 
together with Newton Investment Management 

Limited, an investment boutique of BNY Mellon, 

announced the sale of its private client business. The 

transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and is 

expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. The 

agreement covers assets under management valued at 

£3.6 billion. This transaction is not expected to have a 

significant impact on our financial results. 
U.S. Tax Court Ruling 
On Feb. 11, 2013, the U.S. Tax Court issued a ruling 
against BNY Mellon upholding the IRS’ disallowance 

of certain foreign tax credits claimed for the 2001 and 

2002 tax years. As a result of the ruling and in 

accordance with the accounting for uncertain tax 

positions under ASC 740, BNY Mellon expects to 

record an after-tax charge of approximately 

$850 million during the first quarter of 2013. After 

taking the charge, we expect to continue to be well 

capitalized. Additionally, we expect this charge will 

decrease the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio by 

approximately 55 basis points. 
BNY Mellon will appeal the court’s decision. We 
continue to believe the tax treatment of the transaction 

was consistent with statutory and judicial authority 

existing at the time. 
Central Securities Depository 
In January 2013, we received regulatory approval to 
establish a new issuer central securities depository 

based in Belgium. BNY Mellon CSD SA/NV will 

help integrate and simplify settlement and safekeeping 

services across Europe for the benefit of our 

customers. BNY Mellon 5 Results of Operations (continued) Executive Management changes 
In the fourth quarter of 2012, BNY Mellon announced 
several executive management appointments designed 

to accelerate the company’s success as the global 

leader in investment management and investment 

services. These appointments were effective Jan. 1, 

2013. Karen B. Peetz became President of BNY Mellon. As 
President, Peetz will lead Global Client Management, 

Regional Management, Treasury Services and Human 

Resources. Timothy F. Keaney was named Chief Executive 
Officer of Investment Services as BNY Mellon 

aligned its Asset Servicing, Corporate Trust, 

Depositary Receipts, Global Markets, Global 

Collateral Services, Broker Dealer Services, and 

Pershing businesses under his leadership. Keaney is 

also Vice Chairman of Asset Servicing. 
Brian T. Shea was named President of Investment 
Services and head of BNY Mellon’s Client Service 

Delivery and Client Technology Solutions group. He 

also continues in his role as head of Broker Dealer and 

Advisor Services. As of Feb. 1, 2013, Shea was 

named Chairman of BNY Mellon’s Pershing 

subsidiary. Vice Chairman Curtis Y. Arledge continues as Chief 
Executive Officer of Investment Management, BNY 

Mellon’s asset and wealth management businesses. 
Acquisition of remaining 50% interest in WestLB 
Mellon Asset Management joint venture 
On Oct. 1, 2012, BNY Mellon acquired the remaining 
50% interest in the WestLB Mellon Asset 

Management joint venture from Portigon (formerly 

known as WestLB AG) and consolidated our German 

Asset Management business. WestLB Mellon Asset 

Management was formed in early 2006 as a 50:50 

joint venture between BNY Mellon and Portigon. At 

the date of the acquisition, the WestLB Mellon Asset 

Management joint venture had over 170 employees 

and more than $29 billion in assets under 

management. In December 2012, WestLB Mellon 

Asset Management was renamed Meriten Investment 

Management (“Meriten”). 
Litigation settlements 

In 2012, BNY Mellon agreed to settle several 
significant litigations, including litigation arising from 
losses relating to both Sigma Finance Inc. (“Sigma”) 

and Bernard L. Madoff, along with litigation arising 

from The Bank of New York Mellon’s role as 

indenture trustee for debt issued by affiliates of 

Medical Capital Corp. Settlements relating to the 

Bernard L. Madoff matter and Medical Capital Corp. 

remain subject to court approval. 
Proposed risk-based capital rules 

On June 7, 2012, the U.S. regulatory agencies released 
three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRs”) and 

final market risk rule which provide guidance on the 

determination of regulatory capital ratios. The NPRs 

were published in the Federal Register on Aug. 30, 

2012. At Dec. 31, 2012, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 

common equity ratio calculated under the new 

guidelines was 9.8%. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 

common equity ratio, based on prior Basel III 

guidance and the proposed market risk rule, was 7.1% 

at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase compared with Dec. 

31, 2011 was primarily due to a reduction in risk-

weighted assets related to the treatment of sub-

investment grade securities under the NPRs, earnings 

retention and an increase in the value of the 

investment portfolio, partially offset by balance sheet 

growth in 2012. 
See the “Regulatory Developments” section for a 
discussion of the NPRs and final market risk rule and 

the “Supplemental information – Explanation of Non-

GAAP financial measures” section for the calculation 

of our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio. 
European Central Bank interest rate cut 

On July 5, 2012, the European Central Bank (“ECB”) 
cut its main refinancing rate to 0.75% and reduced its 

deposit rate, which acts as a floor for the money 

markets, to zero. The combination of the lower ECB 

deposit rate and the balances maintained at the ECB 

negatively impacted our net interest revenue by 

approximately $25 million in the second half of 2012. 

The impact to fee revenue from the rate cut has been 

immaterial. Capital plan and share repurchase program 

In March 2012, BNY Mellon received confirmation 
that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System (the “Federal Reserve”) did not object to our 

2012 comprehensive capital plan. Our 2012 capital 

plan included the repurchase of up to $1.16 billion of 

outstanding common stock and the continuation of the 

13 cents per share quarterly cash dividend. 
BNY Mellon 6 Results of Operations (continued) In 2012, we repurchased 49.8 million common shares 
in the open market, at an average price of $22.38 per 

common share for a total of $1.12 billion. Our capital 

plan for 2012 authorized the repurchase of up to $1.16 

billion worth of common shares, or no more than $290 

million per quarter, including both open market 

purchases and employee benefit plan repurchases, 

from the second quarter of 2012 through the first 

quarter of 2013. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 

2013, we continued to repurchase shares under the 

2012 capital plan. Through Feb. 27, 2013, we 

repurchased 7.8 million common shares in the open 

market, at an average price of $27.21 per common 

share for a total of $211 million. 
We submitted our 2013 capital plan on Jan. 7, 2013. 
The Federal Reserve has indicated it expects to 

publish its objection or non-objection to the plan by 

March 14, 2013. We anticipate announcing our 2013 

capital plan shortly thereafter. 
Summary of financial results We reported net income applicable to common 
shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.4 billion, or 

$2.03 per diluted common share in 2012 compared 

with $2.5 billion, or $2.03 per diluted common share 

in 2011 and $2.5 billion, or $2.05 per diluted common 

share in 2010. In 2010, net income applicable to 

common shareholders on a continuing operations 

basis was $2.6 billion, or $2.11 per diluted common 

share. Highlights of 2012 results 
Š AUC/A totaled $26.2 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012 
compared with $25.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The increase primarily reflects higher market 

values and net new business. (See the 

“Investment Services business” beginning on 

page 24.) 
Š Assets under management (“AUM”), excluding 

securities lending assets, totaled a record 

$1.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$1.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase was 

primarily driven by higher market values and net 

new business. (See the “Investment 

Management business” beginning on page 21). 
Š Investment services fees totaled $6.6 billion in 

2012 compared with $6.8 billion in 2011. 

Improved asset servicing revenue, driven by net 

new business and higher market values, as well 

as higher clearing and treasury services 

revenues, were more than offset by the impact of 
the sale of the Shareowner Services business in 

the fourth quarter of 2011, lower Depositary 

Receipts revenue and lower Corporate Trust fees 

reflecting the continued net run-off of structured 

debt securitizations. (See the “Investment 

Services business” beginning on page 24). 
ŠInvestment management and performance fees 

totaled $3.2 billion in 2012 compared with 

$3.0 billion in 2011. The increase was driven by 

higher market values, net new business and 

higher performance fees. (See the “Investment 

Management business” beginning on page 21). 
ŠForeign exchange and other trading revenue 

totaled $692 million in 2012 compared with 

$848 million in 2011. In 2012, foreign exchange 

revenue totaled $520 million, a decrease of 32% 

compared with 2011, driven by a sharp decline 

in volatility and a modest decrease in volumes. 

Other trading revenue was $172 million in 2012 

compared with $87 million in 2011. The 

increase was primarily driven by improved fixed 

income trading. (See “Fee and other revenue” 

beginning on page 9). 
ŠInvestment income and other revenue totaled 

$427 million in 2012 compared with 

$455 million in 2011. The decrease primarily 

resulted from the pre-tax gain on sale of the 

Shareowner Services business recorded in 2011, 

partially offset by higher seed capital gains in 

2012 and the write-down of an equity 

investment recorded in 2011. (See “Fee and 

other revenue” beginning on page 9). 
ŠNet interest revenue totaled $3.0 billion in 2012, 

a decrease of $11 million compared with 2011 

as higher average assets driven by higher client 

deposits, increased investment in higher quality 

investment securities and higher loan levels 

were more than offset by narrower spreads, 

lower accretion, the elimination of interest on 

European Central Bank deposits and lower 

yields on the reinvestment of securities. The net 

interest margin (FTE) was 1.21% in 2012 

compared with 1.36% in 2011. The decrease 

primarily reflects lower reinvestment yields, 

lower accretion, the elimination of interest on 

European Central Bank deposits and growth in 

customer deposits which were invested in liquid, 

lower-yielding assets (See “Net interest 

revenue” beginning on page 13). 
ŠThe provision for credit losses was a credit of 

$80 million in 2012 compared with a provision 

of $1 million in 2011. The credit in 2012 was 

largely driven by a reduction in the allowance 

for credit losses related to the residential 

mortgage loan portfolio. (See “Asset quality and 
BNY Mellon 7 Results of Operations (continued) allowance for credit losses” beginning on 
page 46). 
Š Noninterest expense totaled $11.3 billion in 

2012 compared with $11.1 billion in 2011. The 

increase was primarily driven by higher 

litigation expense, revenue mix and the cost of 

generating certain tax credits, partially offset by 

the impact of the sale of the Shareowner 

Services business and our operational excellence 

initiatives. (See “Noninterest expense” 

beginning on page 16). 
Š BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision 

of $779 million (23.6% effective tax rate) in 

2012 compared with $1.0 billion (29.0% 

effective tax rate) in 2011. The lower effective 

tax rate primarily reflects the benefits associated 

with increased tax credits and the reorganization 

of certain foreign operations. (See “Income 

taxes” on page 18). 
Š The unrealized pre-tax gain on our total 

investment securities portfolio was $2.4 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with $793 million at 

Dec. 31, 2011. The increase primarily reflects a 

decline in interest rates and improved credit 

spreads. (See “Investment securities” beginning 

on page 40). 
Š At Dec. 31, 2012, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 

common equity ratio was 9.8% based on the 

NPRs and final market risk rule. The increase in 

the ratio from 7.1% at Dec. 31, 2011, which was 

calculated under prior Basel III guidance and the 

proposed market risk rule, was primarily due to 

a reduction in risk-weighted assets related to the 

treatment of sub-investment grade securities 

under the NPRs, earnings retention and an 

increase in the value of the investment portfolio, 

partially offset by balance sheet growth. (See 

“Capital” beginning on page 57). 
Š We generated $2.7 billion of gross Basel I Tier 1 

common equity in 2012, primarily driven by 

earnings. Our Basel I Tier 1 capital ratio was 

15.0% at both Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011. 

(See “Capital” beginning on page 57). 
Š In 2012, we repurchased 49.8 million common 

shares in the open market, at an average price of 

$22.38 per share, for a total of $1.12 billion. 
Results for 2011 
In 2011, we reported net income applicable to 
common shareholders of BNY Mellon of $2.5 billion, 

or $2.03 per diluted common share. These results 

were primarily driven by: 
ŠInvestment services fees totaled $6.8 billion 

reflecting the full year impact of the acquisitions 
of Global Investment Servicing (“GIS”) on 

July 1, 2010 and BHF Asset Servicing GmbH 

(“BAS”) on Aug. 2, 2010 (collectively, “the 

Acquisitions”), and net new business. 
Š Investment management and performance fees 

totaled $3.0 billion reflecting net new business 

and higher average equity markets. 
Š Foreign exchange and other trading revenue 

totaled $848 million driven by lower fixed 

income trading revenue and lower foreign 

exchange revenue. 
Š Noninterest expense totaled $11.1 billion 

reflecting the full-year impact of the 

Acquisitions, higher staff expense, volume-

related expenses and software expense, as well 

as higher professional, legal and other purchased 

services. Results for 2010 
In 2010, we reported net income applicable to 
common shareholders, including discontinued 

operations, of $2.5 billion, or $2.05 per diluted 

common share, or on a continuing operations basis, 

net income of $2.6 billion, or $2.11 per diluted 

common share. These results were primarily driven 

by: ŠInvestment services fee revenue totaled $6.1 

billion in 2010 reflecting the Acquisitions, 

higher market values and net new business. 
ŠInvestment management and performance fees 

totaled $2.9 billion in 2010 reflecting higher 

market values globally, the full year impact of 

the acquisition of Insight Investment 

Management Limited (“Insight”) and new 

business. ŠForeign exchange and other trading revenue 

totaled $886 million in 2010 driven by lower 

fixed income and derivatives trading revenue 

and lower foreign exchange revenue. 
ŠNet interest revenue totaled $2.9 billion in 2010 

as a higher yield on the restructured investment 

securities portfolio and higher interest-earning 

assets were offset by lower spreads. 
ŠNoninterest expense totaled $10.2 billion in 

2010 primarily driven by the impact of the 

Acquisitions, the full-year impact of the Insight 

acquisition and higher compensation expense.

Investment management and performance fees 

Investment management and performance fees totaled 
$3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of 6% compared with 

2011. The increase primarily reflects higher market 

values, net new business, higher performance fees and 

the Meriten acquisition. Performance fees were $136 

million in 2012 and $93 million in 2011. 
Total AUM for the Investment Management business 
was a record $1.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2012, compared 

with $1.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase was 

primarily due to higher market values and net new 

business. Long-term inflows in 2012 were $56 billion 

and primarily benefited from liability-driven 

investments and fixed income funds. 
See the “Investment Management business” in 
“Review of businesses” for additional details

(a) Credit derivatives are used as economic hedges of loans. 
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased 
$156 million, or 18%, from $848 million in 2011. In 

2012, foreign exchange revenue totaled $520 million, 

a decrease of 32% compared with $761 million in 

2011. The decrease was driven by a sharp decline in 

volatility and a modest decrease in volumes. As an 

indicator of the decline in volatility, the JPMorgan G7 

Volatility Index, which is an estimate of external 

market indicators, decreased 23% in 2012. 

Additionally, foreign exchange revenue continues to 

be impacted by increasingly competitive market 

pressures. Other trading revenue totaled $172 million 

in 2012, an increase of 98% compared with 2011, 

largely due to improved fixed income trading revenue 

primarily driven by higher interest rate derivatives 

trading revenue. Foreign exchange revenue and fixed 
income trading revenue is reported in the Investment 

Services business and the Other segment. Credit 

derivative/other trading revenue is primarily reported 

in the Other segment. 
The foreign exchange trading engaged in by the 
Company generates revenues, which are influenced by 

the volume of client transactions and the spread 

realized on these transactions. The level of volume 

and spreads is affected by market volatility, the level 

of cross-border assets held in custody for clients, the 

level and nature of underlying cross-border 

investments and other transactions undertaken by 

corporate and institutional clients. These revenues 

also depend on our ability to manage the risk 

associated with the currency transactions we execute. 

A substantial majority of our foreign exchange trades 

is undertaken for our custody clients in transactions 

where BNY Mellon acts as principal, and not as an 

agent or broker. As a principal, we earn a profit, if 

any, based on our ability to risk manage the aggregate 

foreign currency positions that we buy and sell on a 

daily basis. Generally speaking, custody clients enter 

into foreign exchange transactions in one of three 

ways: negotiated trading 
with BNY Mellon, BNY 
Mellon’s standing instruction program
,or 
transactions with 
third-party foreign exchange 
providers. Negotiated trading 
generally refers to 
orders entered by the client or the client’s investment 

manager, with all decisions related to the transaction, 

usually on a transaction-specific basis, made by the 

client or its investment manager. Such transactions 

may be initiated by (i) contacting one of our sales 

desks to negotiate the rate for specific transactions, 

(ii) using electronic trading platforms, or (iii) electing 
other methods such as those pursuant to a 

benchmarking arrangement, in which pricing is 

determined by an objective market rate plus a pre=

negotiated spread. The preponderance of the notional 

value of our trading volume with clients is in 

negotiated trading. Our 
standing instruction program
, including a standing instruction program option called 

the Defined Spread Offering, which the Company 

introduced to clients in the first quarter of 2012, 

provides custody clients and their investment 

managers with an end-to-end solution that allows 

them to shift to BNY Mellon the cost, management 

and execution risk, often in small transactions not 

otherwise eligible for a more favorable rate or 

transactions in restricted and difficult to trade 

currencies. We incur substantial costs in supporting 

the global operational infrastructure required to 

administer the standing instruction program; on a per-

transaction basis, the costs associated with the 

standing instruction program exceed the costs 
10 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) associated with negotiated trading. In response to 
competitive market pressures and client requests, we 

are continuing to develop standing instruction 

program products and services and making these new 

products and services available to our clients. Our 

custody clients choose to use 
third-party foreign 
exchange providers 
other than BNY Mellon for a 
substantial majority of their U.S. dollar-equivalent 

volume foreign exchange transactions. 
We typically price negotiated trades for our custody 
clients at a spread over either our estimation of the 

current market rate for a particular currency or an 

agreed upon third-party benchmark. With respect to 

our standing instruction program, we typically assign 

a price derived from the daily pricing range for 

marketable-size foreign exchange transactions 

(generally more than $1 million) executed between 

global financial institutions, known as the “interbank 

range.” Using the interbank range for the given day, 

we typically price purchases of currencies at or near 

the low end of this range and sales of currencies at or 

near the high end of this range. The standing 

instruction program Defined Spread Offering prices 

transactions in each pricing cycle (several times a day 

in the case of developed market currencies) by adding 

a predetermined spread to an objective market source 

for developed and certain emerging market currencies 

or to a reference rate computed by BNY Mellon for 

other emerging market currencies. A shift by custody 

clients from the standing instruction program to other 

trading options combined with the increasing 

competitive market pressures on the foreign exchange 

business may negatively impact our foreign exchange 

revenue. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, our total 

revenue for all types of foreign exchange trading 

transactions was $520 million, or approximately 4% 

of our total revenue. Approximately 41% of our 

foreign exchange revenue resulted from foreign 

exchange transactions undertaken through our 

standing instruction program. 
Distribution and servicing fees 

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual 
funds are primarily based on average assets in the 

funds and the sales of funds that we manage or 

administer and are primarily reported in the 

Investment Management business. These fees, which 

include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of 

net sales, the relative mix of sales between share 

classes, the funds’ market values and money market 

fee waivers. 
The $5 million increase in distribution and servicing 

fee revenue in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily 

reflects higher market values and lower money market 

fee waivers. The impact of distribution and servicing 

fees on income in any one period is partially offset by 

distribution and servicing expense paid to other 

financial intermediaries to cover their costs for 

distribution and servicing of mutual funds. 

Distribution and servicing expense is recorded as non-

interest expense on the income statement. 
Financing-related fees 
Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported 
in the Other segment, include capital markets fees, 

loan commitment fees and credit-related fees. 

Financing-related fees increased $2 million from 2011 

primarily as a result of higher capital market fees 

primarily offset by lower credit related fees.

investments, lease residual gains, expense 

reimbursements from joint ventures, equity 

investment revenue, asset-related gains, transitional 

services agreements, gains and losses on private 

equity investments, and other income (loss). Expense 

reimbursements from joint ventures relate to expenses 

incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf of joint ventures. 

Asset-related gains include loan, real estate and other 

asset dispositions. Transitional services agreements 

primarily relate to the Shareowner Services business. 

Other income (loss) primarily includes foreign 

currency remeasurement gain (loss), other investments 

and various miscellaneous revenues. The decrease in 

investment and other income compared with 2011 
BNY Mellon 11 
Results of Operations (continued) primarily resulted from the pre-tax gain on the sale of 
Shareowner Services business recorded in 2011, lower 

gains on loans held for sale retained from a previously 

divested bank subsidiary and lower equity investment 

revenue, partially offset by higher seed capital gains 

and an improvement in foreign currency 

remeasurement in 2012 compared with 2011. 
Net securities gains 

Net securities gains totaled $162 million in 2012 
compared with $48 million in 2011. The low interest 

rate environment in 2012 created the opportunity for 

us to realize gains as we rebalanced and managed the 

duration risk of the investment securities portfolio. 

Gains realized on the sales of securities should be 

considered along with net interest revenue when 

evaluating our overall results. 
2011 compared with 2010 

Fee revenue increased 7% in 2011 compared with 
2010, primarily reflecting the full-year impact of the 

Acquisitions, higher average market values and higher 
net new business, partially offset by higher money 

market fee waivers and lower trading revenues. 
Fee and other revenue was also impacted by the 
following: Š Investment services fees increased 13% 

compared with 2010 reflecting the impact of the 

Acquisitions on assets servicing and clearing 

services fees, higher market values, net new 

business, higher Depositary Receipts revenue 

and higher securities lending revenue. This 

increase was partially offset by lower Corporate 

Trust fee revenue and lower money market 

related distribution fees and lower Shareowner 

Services revenue. 
Š Investment management and performance fees 

increased 5% compared with 2010 reflecting 

higher average market values and net new 

business, partially offset by higher money 

market fee waivers and lower performance fees. 
Š Foreign exchange and other trading revenue 

decreased 4% compared with 2010 driven by 

lower volatility and spreads, and lower fixed 

income trading revenue, partially offset by 

higher volumes.

$11 million compared with 2011 as higher average 

assets driven by higher client deposits, increased 

investment in higher quality investment securities, 

such as agency RMBS and state and political 

subdivisions, and higher loan levels were more than 

offset by narrower spreads, lower accretion, the 

elimination of interest on European Central Bank 

deposits and lower yields on the reinvestment of 

securities. The net interest margin (FTE) was 1.21% in 2012 
compared with 1.36% in 2011. The decline was 

primarily driven by lower reinvestment yields, the 

elimination of interest on European Central Bank 

deposits, lower accretion and increased client deposits 

which were invested in lower-yielding assets. 
Average interest-earning assets were $250 billion in 
2012, compared with $222 billion in 2011. The 

increase primarily reflects higher client deposits as a 

function of the continued European debt crisis and 

economic uncertainty in the global marketplace. 

Average total securities increased to $99 billion in 

2012, up from $74 billion in 2011, reflecting our 

strategy to invest in high-quality investment 

securities. Average interest-bearing deposits with the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks increased to 

$64 billion, up from $47 billion in 2011, reflecting 

higher client deposits. 
During 2012, the low interest rate environment 
continued to negatively impact net interest revenue. 

However, it has driven significant improvement in the 

value of the investment securities portfolio while 

creating the opportunity for us to realize gains as we 

rebalance and manage the duration risk of this 

portfolio. Gains realized on these sales should be 

considered along with net interest revenue when 

evaluating our overall results. In 2012, combined net 

interest revenue and net securities gains totaled $3.1 

billion compared with $3.0 billion in 2011. 
2011 compared with 2010 

Net interest revenue totaled $3.0 billion in 2011, a 2% 
increase compared with 2010. The net interest margin 

(FTE) was 1.36% in 2011 compared with 1.70% in 

2010. The trends of net interest revenue and net 

interest margin (FTE) primarily reflect growth in 

client deposits, which were placed with central banks, 

purchases of high quality securities and an increased 

level of secured loans, partially offset by lower 

spreads. BNY Mellon 13

Total noninterest expense increased $221 million, or 
2%, compared with 2011 primarily reflecting higher 

litigation expense and revenue mix. The lower interest 

rate environment and tepid capital markets have 

driven a decline in the revenue of our low variable 

cost businesses, such as Depositary Receipts, foreign 

exchange and other trading and net interest revenue. 

These revenue declines were more than offset by 

increases in investment management, asset servicing, 

clearing and treasury services fees, all of which come 
with higher variable costs. The increase in total 

noninterest expense also reflects the cost of generating 

certain tax credits in 2012, higher software 

amortization, employee benefits expense and business 

development expenses, the Meriten acquisition and 

the benefit of state investment tax credits which were 

recorded in 2011. Partially offsetting these increases 

was the impact of the sale of the Shareowner Services 

business. In addition, savings from our operational 

excellence initiatives primarily offset the impact of 
16 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) headwinds related to compensation and other 
operating expenses. Excluding amortization of 

intangible assets, merger and integration (“M&I”), 

litigation and restructuring charges and the direct 

expenses related to Shareowner Services, noninterest 

expense increased 3%, compared with 2011. 
Staff expense 

Given our mix of fee-based businesses, which are 
staffed with high-quality professionals, staff expense 

comprised 55% of total noninterest expense in 2012 

and 56% in 2011, excluding amortization of intangible 

assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges. 
Staff expense is comprised of: 
Šcompensation expense, which includes: 
–? salary expense, primarily driven by 
headcount; –? the cost of temporary services and overtime; 

and – severance expense;< 
Š incentive expense, which includes:< 
–? additional compensation earned under a wide 

range of sales commission and incentive 

plans designed to reward a combination of 

individual, business unit and corporate 

performance goals; as well as, 
–? stock-based compensation expense; and 
Šemployee benefit expense, primarily medical< 

benefits, payroll taxes, pension and other< 

retirement benefits.< 
Staff expense was $5.8 billion in 2012, an increase of 

1% compared with 2011. The increase in staff 

expense compared with 2011 primarily reflects higher 

pension expense, the annual employee merit increase 

effective in the third quarter of 2012, the Meriten 

acquisition and higher incentive expense driven by 

improved results in our Investment Management 

business, partially offset by the impact of the sale of 

the Shareowner Services business. 
Non-staff expense 
Non-staff expense includes certain expenses that vary 
with the levels of business activity and levels of 

expensed business investments, fixed infrastructure 
costs and expenses associated with corporate activities 

related to technology, compliance, legal, productivity 

initiatives and business development. 
Non-staff expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring 

charges, totaled $4.6 billion in both 2012 and 2011. 

Higher non-staff expense in 2012 resulting from the 

cost of generating certain tax credits, higher software 

amortization, business development expenses and the 

Meriten acquisition was primarily offset by the sale of 

the Shareowner Services business and the impact of 

our operational excellence initiatives. 
In 2012, we incurred $559 million of M&I, litigation 
and restructuring charges compared with $390 million 

in 2011. The increase primarily relates to higher 

litigation expense. A majority of the litigation expense 

in 2012 related to the Sigma and Medical Capital 

Corp. settlements. The financial services industry has seen a continuing 
increase in the level of litigation activity. As a result, 

we anticipate our legal and litigation costs to continue 

at elevated levels. 
For additional information on our legal proceedings, 
see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. In 2012, we recorded a net recovery of $16 million in 
restructuring charges. The net recovery in 2012 

reflects a gain on the sale of a property, which was 

primarily offset by additional severance charges and a 

lease restructuring. For additional information on 

restructuring charges, see Note 12 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
2011 compared with 2010 

Total noninterest expense was $11.1 billion in 2011, 
an increase of $942 million, or 9%, compared with 

2010 primarily reflecting the full-year impact of the 

Acquisitions, which impacted nearly all expense 

categories and accounted for approximately 50% of 

the increase year-over-year. The increase in 

noninterest expense also reflects higher staff expense, 

volume-related expenses and software expense, as 

well as higher professional, legal and other purchased 

services. BNY Mellon 17

Through Dec. 31, 2012, we accomplished the

Business Operations ŠConsolidated Treasury Services functions (e.g., 
check processing and lockbox operations) in our 

Pittsburgh Service Center. 
ŠContinued global footprint positions migration.

Š Consolidated storage platforms. 
Corporate ServicesŠ Consolidated offices and reduced real estate by 

565,000 square feet, primarily in the New York 

Metro region, EMEA region and Los Angeles. 
Š Benefited from our enhanced global procurement

Income taxes BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of 

$779 million (23.6% effective tax rate) in 2012 

compared with of $1.0 billion (29.0% effective tax 

rate) in 2011 and, on a continuing operations basis, 

$1.0 billion (28.3% effective tax rate) in 2010. 
We expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
25% to 26% in 2013, excluding the impact of the U.S. 

Tax Court ruling on Feb. 11, 2013. 
Under U.S. tax law, income from certain non-U.S. 
subsidiaries has not been subject to U.S. income tax as 

result of a deferral provision applicable to income that 

is derived in active conduct of a banking and 

financing business. In January 2013, the active 

financing deferral provision was extended 

retroactively to Jan. 1, 2012 through Dec. 31, 2013 

under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. 
Review of businesses We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and service lines for 

our two principal businesses and the Other segment. 
Organization of our business 

On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner 
Services business. In 2012, we reclassified the results 

of the Shareowner Services business from the 

Investment Services business to the Other segment. 

The reclassification did not impact the consolidated 

results of operations. All prior periods have been 

restated. For information on the accounting principles of our 
businesses, the primary types of revenue by business 

and how our businesses are presented and analyzed, 

see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. Information on our businesses is reported on a 
continuing operations basis for 2010. See Note 4 to 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a 

discussion of discontinued operations. 
18? BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) The results of our businesses may be influenced by 
client activities that vary by quarter. In the second 

quarter, we typically experience an increase in 

securities lending fees due to an increase in demand to 

borrow securities outside of the United States. In the 

third quarter, Depositary Receipts revenue is typically 

higher due to an increased level of client dividend 

payments paid in the quarter. Also in the third quarter, 

volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client 

activity. In our Investment Management business, 

performance fees are typically higher in the fourth 

quarter, as the fourth quarter represents the end of the 

measurement period for many of the performance fee-

eligible relationships. The results of our businesses in 2012 were driven by 
the following factors. The Investment Management 

business benefited from higher market values, net new 

business and higher seed capital gains, as well as 

higher performance fees. Results in the Investment 

Services business were impacted by lower foreign 

exchange revenue, Depository Receipts revenue and 

Corporate Trust fees, partially offset by higher asset 

servicing revenue resulting from net new business and 

higher market values, as well as higher Clearing 
Services revenue. Clearing services revenue increased 

despite a 19% decrease in NYSE and NASDAQ share 

volumes. Net securities gains (losses) are recorded in the Other 
segment. M&I and restructuring charges are corporate 

level items and are therefore recorded in the Other 

segment. Net interest revenue decreased as growth in client 
deposits and increased investment in high quality 

investment securities were more than offset by the 

continued impact of the low interest rate environment 

and lower accretion. 
Noninterest expense increased compared to 2011 
primarily driven by higher litigation expense, revenue 

mix and the cost of generating certain tax credits, 

partially offset by the impact of the sale of the 

Shareowner Services business and our operational 

excellence initiatives.

Results of Operations (continued) Business description 
Our Investment Management business is comprised of 
our affiliated investment management boutiques, 

wealth management business and global distribution 

companies. Our Investment Management business is responsible, 
through various subsidiaries, for U.S. and non-U.S. 

retail, intermediary and institutional investment 

management, distribution and related services. The 

investment management boutiques offer a broad range 

of equity, fixed income, cash and alternative/overlay 

products. In addition to the investment subsidiaries, 

this business includes BNY Mellon Asset 

Management International, which is responsible for 

the investment management and distribution of non-

U.S. products, and the Dreyfus Corporation and its 
affiliates, which are responsible for U.S. investment 

management and distribution of retail mutual funds, 

separate accounts and annuities. We are one of the 

world’s largest asset managers with a top-10 position 

in the U.S., Europe and globally. 
Through BNY Mellon Wealth Management, we offer 
a full array of investment management, wealth and 

estate planning and private banking solutions to help 

clients protect, grow and transfer their wealth through 

an extensive network of offices in the U.S., Canada, 

UK and Asia. Clients include high-net-worth 

individuals and families, charitable gift programs, 

endowments and foundations and related entities. 

BNY Mellon Wealth Management is ranked as the 

nation’s seventh largest wealth manager and third 

largest U.S. private bank. 
The results of the Investment Management business 
are driven by the period-end, average level and mix of 

assets managed and the level of activity in client 

accounts. The overall level of AUM for a given period 

is determined by: 
Š the beginning level of AUM; 
Š the net flows of new assets during the period 

resulting from new business wins and existing 

client enrichments, reduced by the loss of clients 

and withdrawals; and 
Š the impact of market price appreciation or 

depreciation, the impact of any acquisitions or 

divestitures and foreign exchange rates. 
The mix of AUM is determined principally by client 

asset allocation decisions among equities, fixed 

income, money market and alternative investments 

and overlay products. 
Managed equity assets typically generate higher 

percentage fees than money market and fixed-income 

assets. Also, actively managed assets typically 

generate higher management fees than indexed or 

passively managed assets of the same type. 
Management fees are typically subject to fee 
schedules based on the overall level of assets managed 

for a single client or by individual asset class and 

style. This is most prevalent for institutional assets 

where amounts we manage for individual clients are 

typically large. A key driver of organic growth in investment 
management and performance fees is the amount of 

net new AUM flows. Overall market conditions are 

also key drivers, with a significant long-term 

economic driver being the growth of global financial 

assets. Performance fees are generally calculated as a 
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a 

benchmark index or a peer group’s performance. 
Results for this business are also impacted by sales of 
fee-based products. Net interest revenue is determined 

by loan and deposit volumes and the interest rate 

spread between customer rates and internal funds 

transfer rates on loans and deposits. Expenses in this 

business are mainly driven by staffing costs, 

incentives and distribution and servicing expense. 
Review of financial results 

Investment management and performance fees are 
dependent on the overall level and mix of AUM and 

the management fees expressed in basis points (one=

hundredth of one percent) charged for managing those 

assets. Assets under management were a record $1.4 

trillion at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with $1.3 trillion at 

Dec. 31, 2011, an increase of 10%. The increase 

primarily reflects higher market values and net new 

business. Net long-term inflows were $56 billion in 

2012 and benefited from strength in liability-driven 

investments and fixed income funds. Net short-term 

outflows were $20 billion in 2012. Revenue generated 

in the Investment Management business includes 45% 

from non-U.S. sources in 2012 compared with 42% in 

2011. In 2012, Investment Management had pre-tax income 
of $923 million compared with $723 million in 2011. 

Excluding amortization of intangible assets, pre-tax 

income was $1.1 billion in 2012 compared with 

$937 million in 2011. Investment Management results 
22 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) for 2012 reflect higher market values, net new 
business in both the investment management 

boutiques and the wealth management business, 

higher seed capital gains and higher performance fees. 
Investment management fees in the Investment 
Management business were $3.1 billion in 2012 

compared with $3.0 billion in 2011. The increase was 

driven by higher market values, net new business and 

the Meriten acquisition. 
Performance fees were $137 million in 2012 
compared with $93 million in 2011. The increase 

reflects investment strategies that exceeded their 

benchmarks including a higher level of fees generated 

on liability-driven investments. 
In 2012, 36% of investment management fees in the 
Investment Management business were generated 

from managed mutual fund fees. These fees are based 

on the daily average net assets of each fund and the 

management fee paid by that fund. Managed mutual 

fund fee revenue increased 3% in 2012 compared with 

2011. The increase in managed mutual fund fees in 

the Investment Management business was due to 

higher market values and net new business. 
Distribution and servicing fees were $187 million in 
2012 compared with $181 million in 2011. The 

increase primarily reflects higher market values and 

lower money market fee waivers. 
Other fee revenue was $130 million in 2012 compared 
with $21 million in 2011. The increase primarily 

resulted from higher seed capital gains in 2012 and 

the write-down of an equity investment recorded in 

2011. Net interest revenue was $214 million in 2012, 

compared with $206 million in 2011. The increase 

primarily resulted from higher average loans and 

deposits, partially offset by narrower spreads and 

lower accretion. Average loans increased 14% in 2012 

compared with 2011 while average deposits increased 

16% in 2012 compared with 2011. 
Noninterest expense excluding amortization of 
intangible assets was $2.6 billion in 2012 and 

$2.5 billion in 2011. The increase was primarily 

driven by higher staff expense due to higher 

incentives expense resulting from an increase in 

performance fees and the annual employee merit 

increase effective in the third quarter of 2012, the 

Meriten acquisition and higher business development 

expenses. 2011 compared with 2010 

Income before taxes was $723 million in 2011, 
compared with $729 million in 2010. Income before 

taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets and 

support agreement charges was $937 million in 2011 

compared with $966 million in 2010. Fee and other 

revenue increased $67 million, primarily reflecting net 

new business and higher average equity markets, 

which were largely offset by higher money market fee 

waivers, lower non-U.S. markets and performance 

fees, a $30 million write-down of an equity 

investment, mark-to-market seed capital losses and 

lower securities gains. Noninterest expense (excluding 

amortization of intangible assets) increased $101 

million in 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of 

higher distribution and servicing and staff expenses, 

primarily resulting from net new business.

Results of Operations (continued) Business description 
Our Investment Services business provides global 
custody and related services, broker-dealer services, 

collateral services, alternative investment services, 

corporate trust and depositary receipt services, as well 

as clearing services and global payment/working 

capital solutions to institutional clients. 
Our comprehensive suite of financial solutions 
includes: global custody, global fund services, 

securities lending, investment manager outsourcing, 

performance and risk analytics, alternative investment 

services, securities clearance, collateral management, 

corporate trust, American and global depositary 

receipt programs, cash management solutions, 

payment services, liquidity services and other linked 

revenues, principally foreign exchange, global 

clearing and execution, managed account services and 

global prime brokerage solutions. Our clients include 

corporations, public funds and government agencies, 

foundations and endowments; global financial 

institutions including banks, broker-dealers, asset 

managers, insurance companies and central banks; 

financial intermediaries and independent registered 

investment advisors and hedge fund managers. We 

help our clients service their financial assets through a 

network of offices and operations centers in 36 

countries across six continents. 
The results of this business are driven by a number of 
factors which include: the level of transaction activity; 

the range of services provided, including custody, 

accounting, fund administration, daily valuations, 

performance measurement and risk analytics, 

securities lending, and investment manager back-

office outsourcing; the number of accounts; and the 

market value of assets under custody and/or 

administration. Market interest rates impact both 

securities lending revenue and the earnings on client 

deposit balances. Business expenses are driven by 

staff, technology investment, equipment and space 

required to support the services provided by the 

business and the cost of execution, clearance and 

custody of securities. 
We are one of the leading global securities servicing 
providers with $26.2 trillion of assets under custody 

and/or administration at Dec. 31, 2012. We are the 

largest custodian for U.S. corporate and public 

pension plans and we service 46% of the top 50 

endowments. We are a leading custodian in the UK 

and service 20% of UK pensions that require a 

custodian. European asset servicing continues to grow 

across all products, reflecting significant cross-border 
investment and capital flows. The changing regulatory 

environment is also driving demand for new products 

among clients. 
We are one of the largest providers of fund services in 
the world, the third largest fund administrator in the 

alternative investment services industry and service 

41% of the funds in the U.S. exchange-traded funds 

marketplace. BNY Mellon is a leader in both global securities and 
U.S. Government securities clearance. We clear and 
settle equity and fixed income transactions in over 100 

markets and handle most of the transactions cleared 

through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 17 

of the 21 primary dealers. We are an industry leader in 

collateral management, servicing on average $2.0 

trillion in global collateral, including tri-party repo 

collateral worldwide. We currently service 

approximately $1.4 trillion of the $1.8 trillion tri-party 

repo market in the U.S. 
BNY Mellon offers tri-party agent services to dealers 
and cash investors active in the tri-party repurchase, 

or tri-party repo, market. We currently have an 

approximately 80% market share of the U.S. tri-party 

repo market. As a tri-party repo agent, we facilitate 

settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) and 

investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and a cash 

investor agree to a tri-party repo trade and send 

instructions to us. We maintain custody of the 

collateral (the subject securities of the repo) and 

execute the payment and delivery instructions agreed 

to and provided by the principals. 
BNY Mellon is working to significantly reduce the 
risk associated with the secured intraday credit we 

provide with respect to the tri-party repo market. BNY 

Mellon has implemented several measures in that 

regard, including reducing the amount of time we 

extend intraday credit, implementing three-way trade 

confirmations, and automating the way dealers can 

substitute collateral in their tri-party repo trades. 

Additionally, in 2013, we have limited the eligibility 

for intraday credit associated with tri-party repo 

transactions to certain more liquid asset classes that 

will result in a reduction of exposures secured by less 

liquid forms of collateral by dealers. These efforts are 

consistent with the recommendations of the Tri-Party 

Repo Infrastructure Reform Task Force that was 

sponsored by the Payments Risk Committee of the 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York and included 

representatives from a diverse group of market 

participants, including BNY Mellon. We anticipate 
BNY Mellon 25 
Results of Operations (continued) that the combination of these measures will have 
reduced risks substantially in our tri-party repo 

activity in the near term and, together with technology 

enhancements currently in development, will achieve 

the practical elimination of intraday credit in this 

activity by the end of 2014. 
In 2012, we formed Global Collateral Services which 
serves broker-dealers and institutional investors facing 

expanding collateral management needs as a result of 

current and emerging regulatory and market 

requirements. Global Collateral Services brings 

together BNY Mellon’s global capabilities in 

segregating, optimizing, financing and transforming 

collateral on behalf of clients, including its market 

leading broker-dealer collateral management, 

securities lending, collateral financing, liquidity and 

derivatives services teams. 
In securities lending, we are one of the largest lenders 
of U.S. Treasury securities and depositary receipts and 

service a lending pool of approximately $3 trillion in 

29 markets. BNY Mellon provides the infrastructure, technology 
and processing services clients need to expertly 

navigate the ever-changing debt capital markets. We 

service $11.4 trillion in outstanding debt from 61 

locations in 20 countries. 
We serve as depositary for 1,379 sponsored American 
and global depositary receipt programs at Dec. 31, 

2012, acting in partnership with leading companies 

from 68 countries – a 60% global market share. 
Pershing LLC (“Pershing”), our clearing service, takes 
a consultative approach, working with more than 

1,500 financial organizations and 100,000 investment 

professionals who collectively represent 

approximately 5.5 million active accounts by 

delivering dependable operational support; robust 

trading services; flexible technology; an expansive 

array of investment solutions, including managed 

accounts, mutual funds and cash management; 

practice management support; and service excellence. 
Role of BNY Mellon, as a trustee, for mortgage-
backed securitizations 
BNY Mellon acts as trustee and document custodian 
for certain mortgage-backed security (“MBS”) 

securitization trusts. The role of trustee for MBS 

securitizations is limited; our primary role as trustee is 

to calculate and distribute monthly bond payments to 

bondholders. As a document custodian, we hold the 
mortgage, note, and related documents provided to us 

by the loan originator or seller and provide periodic 

reporting to these parties. BNY Mellon, either as 

document custodian or trustee, does not receive 

mortgage underwriting files (the files that contain 

information related to the creditworthiness of the 

borrower). As trustee or custodian, we have no 

responsibility or liability for the quality of the 

portfolio; we are liable only for performance of our 

limited duties as described above and in the trust 

documents. BNY Mellon is indemnified by the 

servicers or directly from trust assets under the 

governing agreements. BNY Mellon may appear as 

the named plaintiff in legal actions brought by 

servicers in foreclosure and other related proceedings 

because the trustee is the nominee owner of the 

mortgage loans within the trusts. 
Review of financial results 

On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner 
Services business. In 2012, we reclassified the results 

of the Shareowner Services business from the 

Investment Services business to the Other segment. 

All prior periods have been restated. 
AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2012 were 26.2 trillion, an 
increase of 4% from 25.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The increase was driven by higher market values and 

net new business. AUC/A were comprised of 33% 

equity securities and 67% fixed income securities at 

Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 32% equity securities 

and 68% fixed income securities at Dec. 31, 2011. 
Income before taxes was $2.3 billion in 2012 
compared with $3.0 billion in 2011. Income before 

taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was 

$2.4 billion in 2012 compared with $3.2 billion in 

2011. Investment Services results in 2012 compared 

with 2011 primarily reflect lower foreign exchange 

revenue, Depositary Receipts revenue, Corporate 

Trust fees and net interest revenue, as well as, higher 

litigation expense, partially offset by higher Asset 

Servicing revenue and Clearing Services revenue. 
Revenue generated in the Investment Services 
business includes 36% from non-U.S. sources in 2012 

compared with 38% in 2011. 
Investment services fees decreased $80 million, or 
1%, in 2012 compared with 2011. 
ŠAsset servicing revenue (global custody, broker-

dealer services and alternative investment 

services) was $3.7 billion in 2012 compared 
26 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) with $3.6 billion in 2011. The increase primarily 
reflects net new business and higher market 

values as well as higher securities lending 

revenue and higher collateral management 

revenue. ŠIssuer services revenue (Corporate Trust and 

Depositary Receipts) was $1.0 billion in 2012, 

down $203 million compared with 2011. The 

decrease primarily resulted from lower 

Depositary Receipts revenue driven by lower 

volumes, and lower Corporate Trust fees 

reflecting the continued net run-off of structured 

debt securitizations. We estimate this run-off 

could reduce the Company’s total annual 

revenue by approximately one-half to three-

quarters of 1% if the structured debt markets do 

not recover. 
ŠClearing services revenue (Pershing) was 

$1.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $34 million 

compared with 2011. Higher mutual fund fees 

driven by increases in positions and assets and 

higher cash management balances, were 

primarily offset by lower clearance revenue, 

higher money market fee waivers and a 6% 

decrease in DARTS volume. 
ŠTreasury services revenue was $543 million in 

2012, compared with $532 million in 2011. The 

increase reflects higher volumes in cash 

management services. 
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue decreased 

$203 million compared with 2011, driven by a sharp 

decline in volatility and a modest decrease in 

volumes. Net interest revenue decreased $123 million compared 
with 2011, primarily driven by lower accretion and 

narrower spreads, partially offset by higher average 

customer deposits. 
Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets, increased $342 million compared 

with 2011. The increase in expenses primarily resulted 

from higher litigation expense and higher software 

amortization expense, partially offset by lower 

volume-driven expenses and the impact of the 

operational excellence initiatives. 
2011 compared with 2010 

Income before taxes was $3.0 billion in 2011, 
compared with $3.1 billion in 2010. Income before 

taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets, was 

$3.2 billion in both 2011 and 2010. Fee and other 

revenue increased $693 million compared with 2010, 
primarily due to the full-year impact of the 

Acquisitions and net new business, partially offset by 

higher money market fee waivers and lower volumes. 

Net interest revenue increased $203 million compared 

with 2010, primarily driven by higher average 

customer deposits and loan levels, offset in part by 

narrower spreads. Noninterest expense, excluding 

amortization of intangible assets, increased 

$943 million compared with 2010. The increase in 

expenses primarily resulted from the full-year impact 

of the Acquisitions, higher litigation and volume-

driven expenses and increased expenses in support of 

business growth.

Expenses include: 
Š M&I and restructuring charges; 
Š direct expenses supporting credit-related 

services, leasing, investing and funding 

activities, and the Shareowner Services business; 

and Š certain corporate overhead not directly 

attributable to the operations of other businesses. 
Review of financial results 
On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner 
Services business. In 2012, we reclassified the results 

of the Shareowner Services business to the Other 

segment from the Investment Services business. All 

prior periods have been restated. 
Income before taxes was $52 million in 2012 
compared with a pre-tax loss of $153 million in 2011. 

The improvement primarily related to lower M&I and 

restructuring charges and a credit in the provision for 

credit losses in 2012 of $78 million. The credit was 

largely driven by a reduction in the allowance for 

credit losses related to the residential mortgage loan 

portfolio. Total revenue decreased $60 million in 2012 
compared with 2011 primarily reflecting the impact of 

the sale of the Shareowner Services business in 2011 

and lower gains on loans held-for-sale retained from a 

previously divested bank subsidiary, partially offset 

by higher net interest revenue, higher net securities 

gains and higher fixed income trading revenue. 
Noninterest expense (excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and M&I and restructuring charges) 

decreased $63 million in 2012 compared with 2011. 

The decrease was driven by the impact of the sale of 

the Shareowner Services business, partially offset by 

the costs of certain tax credits in 2012 and the benefit 

of state investment tax credits received in 2011. 
2011 compared with 2010 

Income before taxes was a loss of $153 million in 
2011 compared with a loss of $168 million in 2010. 
Total revenue decreased $102 million, primarily due 

to lower net interest revenue, lower leasing gains, 

financing related fees and private equity investment 

gains, partially offset by gains on loans held-for-sale 

retained from a previously divested bank subsidiary 

and the gain on the sale of the Shareowner Services 

business. Noninterest expense, excluding amortization 

of intangible assets and M&I and restructuring 

charges decreased $122 million in 2011 compared 

with 2010. The decrease was driven by lower 

litigation expense and the benefit of state investment 

tax credits in 2011. 
International operations Our primary international activities consist of 
securities services and global payment services in our 

investment services business, and asset management 

in our investment management business. 
Our clients include some of the world’s largest asset 
managers, insurance companies, corporations, 

financial intermediaries, local authorities and pension 

funds. Through our global network of offices, we have 

developed a deep understanding of local requirements 

and cultural needs and we pride ourselves in providing 

dedicated service through our multilingual sales, 

marketing and client service teams. 
We conduct business through subsidiaries, branches, 
and representative offices in 36 countries. We have 

operational centers based in Brussels, Cork, Dublin, 

Wexford, Luxembourg, Singapore, Wroclaw, 

throughout the UK including London, Manchester, 

Brentwood, Edinburgh and Poole, and Chennai and 

Pune in India. 
In January 2013, we received regulatory approval to 
establish a new issuer central securities depository 

based in Belgium. BNY Mellon CSD SA/NV will 

help integrate and simplify settlement and safekeeping 

services across Europe for the benefit of our 

customers. At Dec. 31, 2012, we had approximately 9,300 
employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa 

(“EMEA”), approximately 9,900 employees in the 

Asia-Pacific region (“APAC”) and approximately 800 

employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil. 
BNY Mellon Asset Management operates on a multi-
boutique model, bringing investors the skills of our 

specialist boutique asset managers, which together 

manage investments spanning virtually all asset 

classes. 28 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) We are one of the largest global asset managers, 
ranking 7th in the institutional marketplace and are the 

7th largest asset manager in Europe. We are also a 

market leader in the field of liability-driven 

investments. At Dec. 31, 2012, our international operations 
managed 41% of BNY Mellon’s AUM compared with 

38% at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase primarily resulted 

from higher market values and net new business. 
In Europe, we maintain a significant presence in the 
Undertakings for Collective Investment in 

Transferable Securities Directives (“UCITS”) 

servicing field. In Ireland, BNY Mellon is the largest 

administrator (by total net assets) for fund 

administration services across domiciled and non-

domiciled funds. We offer a full range of tailored 

solutions for investment companies, financial 

institutions and institutional investors in Germany. 

We clear and settle equity and fixed income 

transactions in over 100 markets. We are an industry 

leader in collateral management, servicing more than 

$2.0 trillion in global collateral, including tri-party 

repo collateral worldwide. 
We serve as the depositary for 1,379 sponsored 
American and global depositary receipt programs, 

acting in partnership with leading companies from 68 

countries. BNY Mellon provides the infrastructure 

technology and processing services clients need to 

expertly navigate the ever-changing debt capital 

markets. We service $11.4 trillion in outstanding debt 

from 61 locations in 20 countries. 
We have over 50 years of experience providing trade 
and cash services to financial institutions and central 

banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a broad 

range of servicing and fiduciary products to financial 

institutions, corporations and central banks depending 

on the state of market development. In emerging 

markets, we lead with global payments and issuer 

services, introducing other products as the markets 

mature. For more established markets, our focus is on 

global, not local, investment services. 
We are also a full-service global provider of foreign 
exchange services, actively trading in over 80 of the 

world’s currencies. We serve clients from ten trading 

rooms in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Revenue generated in the Investment Services 
business includes 36% from non-U.S. sources in 2012 

compared with 38% in 2011. 
Our financial results, as well as our level of AUM and 

AUC/A, are impacted by the translation of financial 

results denominated in foreign currencies to the 

U.S. dollar. We are primarily impacted by activities 
denominated in the British pound and the Euro. If the 

U.S. dollar depreciates against these currencies, the 
translation impact is a higher level of fee revenue, net 

interest revenue, noninterest expense and AUM and 

AUC/A. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the 

translated levels of fee revenue, net interest revenue, 

noninterest expense and AUM and AUC/A will be 

lower. Foreign exchange rates for

Net income from international operations was 

$1.4 billion in 2012 compared with net income of 

$1.5 billion in 2011 and net income from continuing 

operations of $1.5 billion in 2010. 
In 2012, revenues from EMEA were $3.7 billion, 
compared with $3.8 billion in 2011 and $3.5 billion in 

2010. Revenues from EMEA were down 3% for 2012 

compared to 2011. The decrease in 2012 primarily 

reflects lower Corporate Trust and Depositary 

Receipts revenue, partially offset by higher 

investment management revenue and performance 

fees. Investment Services generated 65% and 

Investment Management generated 34% of EMEA 

revenues. Net income from EMEA was $761 million 

in 2012 compared with net income of $867 million in 

2011 and net income from continuing operations of 

$916 million in 2010. 
Revenues from APAC were $902 million in 2012 
compared with $842 million in 2011 and $745 million 

in 2010. Revenues from APAC were up 7% for 2012 

compared to 2011. The increase in 2012 primarily 

resulted from net new business offset by lower 

Depositary Receipts revenue and lower Corporate 

Trust fees. Revenue from APAC in 2012 was 

generated by Investment Services 69% and 

Investment Management 27%. Net income from 

APAC was $349 million in 2012 compared with net 

income of $325 million in 2011 and net income from 

continuing operations of $295 million in 2010.

Exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and 
Greece The following tables present our on-and off-balance 
sheet exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal at 

Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011. We have provided 

expanded disclosure on these countries as they have 

experienced particular market focus on credit quality 

and are countries experiencing economic concerns. 

Where appropriate, we are offsetting the risk 

associated with the gross exposure in these countries 

with collateral that has been pledged, which primarily 

consists of cash or marketable securities, or by 

transferring the risk to a third-party guarantor in 

another country. 
BNY Mellon has a limited economic interest in the 
performance of assets of consolidated investment 
management funds, and therefore they are excluded 

from this presentation. The liabilities of consolidated 

investment management funds represent the interest of 

the noteholders of the funds and are solely dependent 

on the value of the assets. Any loss in the value of 

assets of consolidated investment management funds 

would be incurred by the fund’s noteholders. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, BNY Mellon had exposure of less 
than $1 million to Portugal. At Dec. 31, 2012 and 

Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon had no exposure to 

Greece. Additionally, BNY Mellon had no sovereign 

exposure to the countries disclosed below at either 

Dec. 31, 2012 or Dec. 31, 2011. 
Our exposure to Ireland is principally related to Irish 
domiciled investment funds. Servicing provided to 

these funds and fund families may result in overdraft 

exposure. See “Risk management” for additional information on 
how our exposures are managed.

BNY Mellon 33 
Results of Operations (continued) Allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments 
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for 
lending-related commitments represent management’s 

estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit 

portfolio. This evaluation process is subject to 

numerous estimates and judgments. 
We utilize a quantitative methodology and qualitative 
framework for determining the allowance for loan 

losses and the allowance for lending-related 

commitments. Within this qualitative framework, 

management applies judgment when assessing 

internal risk factors and environmental factors to 

compute an additional allowance for each component 

of the loan portfolio. 
The three elements of the allowance for loan losses 
and the allowance for lending-related commitments 

include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: 
Š an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million 

or greater; 
Š an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 

pass-rated credits; and 
Š an allowance for residential mortgage loans. 
Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. As 

a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 million. 

Therefore, the first element, impaired credits, is based 

on individual analysis of all impaired loans of $1 

million or greater. The allowance is measured by the 

difference between the recorded value of impaired 

loans and their impaired value. Impaired value is 

either the present value of the expected future cash 

flows from the borrower, the market value of the loan, 

or the fair value of the collateral. 
The second element, higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 

model. All borrowers are assigned to pools based on 

their credit ratings. The probable loss inherent in each 

loan in a pool incorporates the borrower’s credit 

rating, loss given default rating and maturity. The loss 

given default incorporates a recovery expectation. The 

borrower’s probability of default is derived from the 

associated credit rating. Borrower ratings are 

reviewed at least annually and are periodically 

mapped to third-party databases, including rating 

agency and default and recovery databases, to ensure 

ongoing consistency and validity. Higher risk-rated 

credits are reviewed quarterly. All loans over $1 

million are individually analyzed before being 

assigned a credit rating. 
The third element, the allowance for residential 

mortgage loans, is determined by segregating six 

mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging from 

current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 

default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. In 2012, BNY Mellon began 

assigning all residential mortgage pools, except home 

equity lines of credit, a probability of default and loss 

given default based on five years of default and loss 

data derived from our residential mortgage portfolio. 

Prior to 2012, estimates of probability of default and 

loss given default factors were based on a 

combination of external data from third-party 

databases and internal data. The decision to change 

was triggered when five years of historical data 

became available in 2012. The use of internal 

historical data provides a better estimate of the 

allowance, given that it is based on actual default and 

loss experience on our residential mortgage portfolio. 

The use of internal historical default and loss data 

resulted in a credit to the allowance for credit losses of 

$51 million in 2012. For each pool, the inherent loss is 

calculated using the above factors. The resulting 

probable loss factor (the probability of default 

multiplied by the loss given default) is applied against 

the loan balance to determine the allowance held for 

each pool. For home equity lines of credit, probability 

of default and loss given default are based on external 

data from third party databases due to the small size of 

the portfolio and insufficient internal data. 
The qualitative framework is used to determine an 
additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 

factors below: 
Internal risk factors: 
Š Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Š Criticized assets to total loans and lending-
related commitments; 
Š Ratings volatility; 
Š Borrower concentration; and 
Š Significant concentration in high risk industries. 
Environmental risk factors: 
Š U.S. non-investment grade default rate; 
Š Unemployment rate; and 
Š Change in real GDP. 
The objective of the qualitative framework is to 

capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 

captured in the quantitative reserve which is based 

primarily on historical data. Management determines 
34 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) the qualitative allowance each period based on 
judgment informed by consideration of internal and 

external risk factors. Once determined in the 

aggregate, our qualitative allowance is then allocated 

to each of our loan classes based on the respective 

classes’ quantitative allowance balances with the 

allocations adjusted, when necessary, for class 

specific risk factors. 
For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to 

evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 

The distribution of historical experience is compared 

to the risk factor’s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the 

portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 

relative to our historical experience. 
Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level-no 
impact, low, moderate, high and elevated – to each 

risk factor for the current quarter. Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine an 

aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the impact of 

any particular risk factor. Management’s assessment 

of the risk factors, as well as the trend in the 

quantitative allowance, supports management’s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 

allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 

reflected incurred losses associated with the aggregate 

risk level. A greater qualitative allowance may be 

required if our quantitative allowance does not yet 

reflect the incurred losses associated with the 

aggregate risk level. 
Our consideration of these factors has remained 
consistent for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012. In 

general, we have not seen significant trends in any of 

our risk factors resulting in a corresponding change in 

our qualitative allowance. As a result, the qualitative 

allowance balance as a percentage of the total 

allowance has remained stable from Dec. 31, 2011 to 

Dec. 31, 2012. 
To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or 
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit 

losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. 
The credit rating assigned to each credit is a 
significant variable in determining the allowance. If 

each credit were rated one grade better, the allowance 

would have decreased by $52 million, while if each 

credit were rated one grade worse, the allowance 

would have increased by $83 million. Similarly, if the 

loss given default were one rating worse, the 

allowance would have increased by $51 million, while 
if the loss given default were one rating better, the 

allowance would have decreased by $39 million. For 

impaired credits, if the net carrying value of the loans 

was 10% higher or lower, the allowance would have 

decreased or increased by $2 million, respectively. 
Fair value of financial instruments 

The guidance related to 
Fair Value Measurement 
included in Accounting Standards Codification 
(“ASC”) 820 defines fair value, establishes a 

framework for measuring fair value, and expands 

disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair 

value. The standard also established a three-level 

hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the 

transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or 

liability as of the measurement date. 
Fair value – Securities 
Level 1 – Securities 
– Recent quoted prices from 
exchange transactions are used for debt and equity 
securities that are actively traded on exchanges and 

for U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government 
securities that are actively traded in highly liquid 
over-the-counter markets. Level 2 – Securities – 
For securities where quotes 
from recent transact
ions are not available for identical 

securities, we determine fair value primarily based on 

pricing sources with reasonable levels of price 

transparency. The pricing sources employ financial 

models or obtain comparisons to similar instruments 

to arrive at “consensus” prices. 
Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 

vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 

ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 

prepayment for the type of transaction and apply such 

variables to similar types of bonds. We view these as 

observable transactions in the current market place 

and classify such securities as Level 2. 
In addition, we have significant investments in more 
actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 

securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 

observed trade price and other information feeds from 

the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial 
strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 

information is included in the fair value assessment 

for such securities. 
BNY Mellon 35 
Results of Operations (continued) The pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific 
security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 

price. The pricing sources did not discontinue pricing 

for any securities in our investment securities 

portfolio at Dec. 31, 2012. 
We obtain prices for our Level 1 and Level 2 
securities from multiple pricing sources. We have 

designed controls to develop an understanding of the 

pricing sources’ securities pricing methodology and 

have implemented specific internal controls over the 

valuation of securities. 
As appropriate, we review the quality control 
procedures and pricing methodologies used by the 

pricing sources, including the process for obtaining 

prices provided by the pricing sources, their valuation 

methodology and controls for each class of security. 
Prices received from pricing sources are subject to 
validation checks that help determine the completeness 

and accuracy of the prices. These validation checks are 

reviewed by management and, based on the results, 

may be subject to additional review and investigation. 

We also review securities with no price changes (stale 

prices) and securities with zero values. 
We have a surveillance process in place to monitor the 
accuracy of prices provided by the pricing sources. 

We utilize a hierarchy that compares security prices 

obtained from multiple pricing sources against 

established thresholds. Discrepancies that fall outside 

of these thresholds are challenged with the pricing 

services and adjusted if necessary. 
If further research is required, we review and validate 
these prices with the pricing sources. We also validate 

prices from pricing sources by comparing prices 

received to actual observed prices from actions such 

as purchases and sales, when possible. 
Level 3 – Securities 
– Where we have used our own 
cash flow models, w
hich included a significant input 
into the model that was deemed unobservable, to 

estimate the value of securities, we classify them in 

Level 3 of the ASC 820 hierarchy. More than 99% of 

our securities are valued by pricing sources with 

reasonable levels of price transparency. Less than 1% 

of our securities are priced based on economic models 

and non-binding dealer quotes, and are included in 

Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for details of our securities by ASC 820 

hierarchy level. 
Fair value – Derivative financial instruments 
Level 1 – Derivative financial instruments 
– Includes derivative financial instruments that are ac
tively 
traded on exchanges, principally foreign exchange 

futures, listed options and foreign exchange forward 

contracts. Level 2 – Derivative financial instruments 
– Includes the majority of our derivative financial ins
truments priced using internally developed models that use 

observable inputs for interest rates, foreign exchange 

rates, option volatilities and other factors. The 

valuation process takes into consideration factors such 

as counterparty credit quality, liquidity and 

concentration concerns. 
Level 3 – Derivative financial instruments 
– Certain derivatives that are highly structured requi
re significant judgment and analysis to adjust the value 

determined by standard pricing models. These 

derivatives are included in Level 3 of the ASC 820 

hierarchy and comprise less than 1% of our derivative 

financial instruments at fair value. 
To test the appropriateness of the valuations, we 
subject the models to review and approval by an 

independent internal risk management function, 

benchmark the models against similar instruments and 

validate model estimates to actual cash transactions. 

In addition, we perform detailed reviews and analyses 

of profit and loss. Valuation adjustments are 

determined and controlled by a function independent 

of the area initiating the risk position. As markets and 

products develop and the pricing for certain products 

becomes more transparent, we refine our valuation 

methods. Any changes to the valuation models are 

reviewed by management to ensure the changes are 

justified. To confirm that our valuation policies are consistent 
with exit prices as prescribed by ASC 820, we review 

our derivative valuations using recent transactions in 

the marketplace, pricing services and the results of 

similar types of transactions. In determining fair value 

for these instruments, observable inputs are utilized 

where available as required by ASC 820. 
For details of our derivative financial instruments by 
ASC 820 hierarchy level, see Note 21 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Fair value option 

ASC 825 provides the option to elect fair value as an 
alternative measurement basis for selected financial 

assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm 
36 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) commitments and written loan commitments which 
are not subject to fair value under other accounting 

standards. Under ASC 825, fair value is used for both 

the initial and subsequent measurement of the 

designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with 

the changes in fair value recognized in income. See 

Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for additional disclosure regarding the fair 

value option. 
Fair value – Judgments 

In times of illiquid markets and financial stress, actual 
prices and valuations may significantly diverge from 

results predicted by models. In addition, other factors 

can affect our estimate of fair value, including market 

dislocations, incorrect model assumptions, and 

unexpected correlations. These valuation methods 

could expose us to materially different results should 

the models used or underlying assumptions be 

inaccurate. See “Basis of presentation” in Note 1 to 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Other-than-temporary impairment 

The guidance included in ASC 320 defines the other=
than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model for 

investments in debt securities. Under this guidance, a 

debt security is considered impaired if its fair value is 

less than its amortized cost basis. An OTTI is 

triggered if (1) the intent is to sell the security, (2) the 

security will more likely than not have to be sold 

before the impairment is recovered, or (3) the 

amortized cost basis is not expected to be recovered. 

When an entity does not intend to sell the security 

before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the 

credit component of an OTTI of a debt security in 

earnings and the remaining portion in accumulated 

other comprehensive income. 
The determination of whether a credit loss exists is 
based on best estimates of the present value of cash 

flows to be collected from the debt security. 

Generally, cash flows are discounted at the effective 

interest rate implicit in the debt security at the time of 

acquisition. For debt securities that are beneficial 

interests in securitized financial assets and are not 

high credit quality, ASC 325 provides that cash flows 

be discounted at the current yield used to accrete the 

beneficial interest. 
For each security in the investment securities portfolio 
(including, but not limited to, those whose fair value 

is less than their amortized cost basis), an extensive, 

regular review is conducted to determine if an OTTI 
has occurred. For example, to determine if an 

unrealized loss on non-agency RMBS is other-than=

temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the 

underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 

calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 

upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 

in order to determine the projected collateral loss. We 

also evaluate the current credit enhancement 

underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash 

flows. If we determine that a given RMBS will be 

subject to a write-down or loss, we record the 

expected credit loss as a charge to earnings. 
In 2012, improving home prices helped to stabilize the 
credit performance of non-agency RMBS transactions. 

This in turn enabled us to maintain generally stable 

assumptions for these transactions throughout the year 

with regard to estimated defaults and the amount we 

expect to receive to cover the value of the original loan. 

See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for projected weighted-average default rates 

and loss severities at Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011 for the 

2007, 2006 and late-2005 non-agency RMBS and the 

securities previously held in the Grantor Trust we 

established in connection with the restructuring of our 

investment securities portfolio in 2009. If actual 

delinquencies, default rates and loss severity 

assumptions worsen, we would expect additional 

impairment losses to be recorded in future periods. 
Net securities gains in 2012 were $162 million 
compared with $48 million in 2011. The low interest 

rate environment in 2012 created the opportunity for 

us to realize gains as we rebalanced and managed the 

duration risk of the investment securities portfolio. 
If we were to increase or decrease each of our 
projected loss severity and default rates by 100 basis 

points on each of the positions in our Alt-A, subprime 

and prime RMBS portfolios, including the securities 

previously held by the Grantor Trust, credit-related 

impairment charges on these securities would have 

increased by $1 million (pre-tax) or decreased by less 

than $1 million (pre-tax) at Dec. 31, 2012. 
Goodwill and other intangibles 

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired in 
purchase acquisitions, including goodwill, indefinite-

lived intangibles and other intangibles, in accordance 

with ASC 805 
Business Combinations
. Goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are 

subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC 350 

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. 
The initial 
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires 

judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the 
BNY Mellon 37 
Results of Operations (continued) acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($18.1 billion at 
Dec. 31, 2012) and indefinite-lived intangible assets 

($2.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2012) are not amortized but 

subject to tests for impairment annually or more often if 

events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than 

not they may be impaired. Other intangible assets are 

amortized over their estimated useful lives and are 

subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate 

a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. 
BNY Mellon’s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment 

testing is done in accordance with ASC 350. The 

Investment Management segment is comprised of two 

reporting units; the Investment Services segment is 

comprised of four reporting units; and one reporting 

unit is included in the Other segment. 
The goodwill impairment test is performed in two 
steps. The first step compares the estimated fair value 

of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including 

goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting 

unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the 

reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if 

the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to 

exceed its estimated fair value, a second step would be 

performed that would compare the implied fair value of 

the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount 

of that goodwill. An impairment loss would be 

recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of 

goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. A substantial 

goodwill impairment charge would not have a 

significant impact on our financial condition, but could 

have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In 

addition, due to regulatory restrictions, the Company’s 

subsidiary banks could be restricted from distributing 

available cash to the Parent resulting in the Parent 

needing to issue additional long-term debt. 
GAAP also requires that an interim test be done 
whenever events or circumstances occur that may 

indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair 

value of any reporting unit might be less than its 

carrying value. The broad decline of stock prices 

throughout the U.S. stock market in the second half of 

2011 also impacted the Company’s stock price, which 

declined below the Company’s net book value per 

share. As a result of this sustained decline in the 

second half of 2011, the Company performed an 

interim goodwill test on the Asset Management 

business during the first quarter of 2012. We 

concluded the Asset Management reporting unit, 

which is one of the two reporting units in the 

Investment Management segment, exceeded its 

carrying value at that time. 
In the second quarter of 2012, we performed our 

annual goodwill test on all seven reporting units using 

an income approach to estimate the fair values of each 

reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in the 

income approach were based on management’s 

projections as of April 1, 2012. The discount rate 

applied to these cash flows ranged from 10% to 

12.25% and incorporated a 7% market equity risk 

premium. Estimated cash flows extend far into the 

future, and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate 

over such an extended time frame. 
As of the date of the annual test, the fair values of six 
of the Company’s reporting units were substantially in 

excess of the respective reporting units’ carrying 

value. The fair value of the Asset Management 

reporting unit, which is one of the two reporting units 

in the Investment Management segment, exceeded its 

carrying value by approximately 15%. The Asset 

Management reporting unit has $7.7 billion of 

allocated goodwill. For the Asset Management 

reporting unit, in the future, small changes in the 

assumptions could produce a non-cash goodwill 

impairment, which would have no effect on our 

regulatory capital ratios. In addition, certain money 

market fee waiver practices and changes in the level 

of assets under management could have an effect on 

Asset Management broadly, as well as the fair value 

of this reporting unit. 
Key judgments in accounting for intangibles include 
useful life and classification between goodwill and 

indefinite-lived intangibles or other intangibles 

requiring amortization. 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for 
impairment at least annually by comparing their fair 

values, estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, 

to their carrying values. Other amortizing intangible 

assets ($2.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2012) are evaluated for 

impairment if events and circumstances indicate a 

possible impairment. Such evaluation of other 

intangible assets is initially based on undiscounted 

cash flow projections. 
See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional information 

regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual 

and interim impairment testing. 
Pension accounting 

BNY Mellon has defined benefit pension plans 
covering approximately 20,900 U.S. employees and 

approximately 10,600 non-U.S. employees. 
38 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) BNY Mellon has two qualified and several non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and 

several pension plans overseas. As of Dec. 31, 2012, 

the U.S. plans accounted for 82% of the projected 

benefit obligation. The pension expense for BNY 

Mellon plans was $141 million in 2012 compared 

with $93 million in 2011 and $47 million in 2010. 
Effective Jan. 1, 2011, the U.S. pension plan was 
amended to reduce benefits earned by participants for 

service after 2010, and to freeze plan participation 

such that no new employees will enter the plan after 

Dec. 31, 2010. This change in the pension plan 

reduced pension expense by $40 million in 2011. 
A net pension expense of $187 million is expected to 
be recorded by BNY Mellon in 2013, assuming 

currency exchange rates at Dec. 31, 2012. The 

expected increase in pension expense in 2013 is 

primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate for 

the U.S. and foreign plans. The discount rate is 

discussed below. 
BNY Mellon made a discretionary contribution of 
$400 million to The Bank of New York Mellon 

Corporation Pension Plan in December 2012. The 

contribution did not impact pension expense in 2012. 
A number of key assumption and measurement date 
values determine pension expense. The key elements 

include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the 

discount rate, the market-related value of plan assets 

and the price used to value stock in the Employee 

Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Since 2010, these 

key elements have varied as follows:

except per share 

amounts) 2013 2012 2011 2010 
Domestic plans: Long-term rate of

are for the beginning of the plan year. See “Summary of 

significant accounting and reporting policies” in Note 1 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The discount rate for U.S. pension plans was 
determined after reviewing equivalent rates obtained 

by discounting the pension plans’ expected cash flows 

using various high-quality, long-term corporate bond 

yield curves. We also reviewed the results of several 

models that matched bonds to our pension cash flows. 

After reviewing the various indices and models, we 

selected a discount rate of 4.25% as of Dec. 31, 2012. 
The discount rates for foreign pension plans are based 
on high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that 

have an active corporate bond market. In those 

countries with no active corporate bond market, 

discount rates are based on local government bond 

rates plus a credit spread. 
Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 
based on anticipated returns for each applicable asset 

class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the expected 

allocation for each asset class. Anticipated returns are 

based on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity 

and fixed income markets, which should track the long=

term historical returns for these markets. We also consider 

the growth outlook for U.S. and global economies, as well 

as current and prospective interest rates. 
The market-related value of plan assets also 
influences the level of pension expense. Differences 

between expected and actual returns are recognized 

over five years to compute an actuarially derived 

market-related value of plan assets. 
Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized 
over the future service period of active employees if 

they exceed a threshold amount. BNY Mellon 

currently has $2.2 billion of unrecognized losses 

which are being amortized. 
The annual impacts of hypothetical changes in the key 
assumptions on pension costs are shown in the table

Results of Operations (continued) In addition to its pension plans, BNY Mellon has an 
ESOP. Benefits payable under The Bank of New York 

Mellon Corporation Pension Plan are offset by the 

equivalent value of benefits earned under the ESOP for 

employees who participated in the legacy Retirement 

Plan of The Bank of New York Company, Inc. 
Consolidated balance sheet review At Dec. 31, 2012, total assets were $359 billion 
compared with $325 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. Total 

assets averaged $315 billion in 2012, compared with 

$291 billion in 2011. The increase in period-end and 

average total assets primarily resulted from an 

increase in the level of client deposits. Deposits 

totaled $246 billion at Dec. 31, 2012, and $219 billion 

at Dec. 31, 2011. Total deposits averaged $204 billion 

in 2012 and $183 billion in 2011. At Dec. 31, 2012, 

total interest-bearing deposits were 52% of total 

interest-earning assets compared with 48% at Dec. 31, 

2011. At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $50 billion of liquid funds 
and $95 billion of cash (including $90 billion of 

overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve and other 

central banks) for a total of $145 billion of available 

funds. This compares with available funds of $135 

billion at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in available 

funds resulted from the higher level of customer 

deposits. Our percentage of available funds to total 

assets was 40% at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 42% 

at Dec. 31, 2011. The decrease in the percentage of 

available funds to total assets was primarily due to 

increased investments in high quality investment 

securities and higher loan levels. Of the $50 billion in 

liquid funds held at Dec. 31, 2012, $44 billion was 

placed in interest-bearing deposits with large, highly-

rated global financial institutions with a weighted-

average life to maturity of approximately 50 days. Of 

the $44 billion, $8 billion was placed with banks in 

the Eurozone. 
Investment securities were $101 billion or 28% of 
total assets at Dec. 31, 2012, compared with 

$82 billion or 25% of total assets at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The increase primarily reflects larger investments in 

agency RMBS and state and political subdivision 

securities, as well as an improvement in the unrealized 

gain of our investment securities portfolio. 
Loans were $47 billion or 13% of total assets at Dec. 
31, 2012, compared with $44 billion or 14% of total 
assets at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in loan levels 

primarily reflects higher wealth management loans 

and mortgages, margin loans and overdrafts. 
Long-term debt decreased to $18.5 billion at Dec. 31, 
2012 from $19.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, primarily 

due to the maturity of $3.2 billion of senior debt and 

$300 million of subordinated debt, as well as the 

redemption of $1.1 billion of junior subordinated 

debentures, partially offset by the issuance of $3.25 

billion of senior debt in 2012. 
Total shareholders’ equity applicable to BNY Mellon 
was $36.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2012 and $33.4 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in total shareholders’ 

equity primarily reflects earnings retention, the 

issuance of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 

and an increase in the valuation of our investment 

securities portfolio, partially offset by share 

repurchases. In 2012, we issued $1,068 million, net of 

issuance costs, of noncumulative perpetual preferred 

stock which qualifies as Tier 1 capital under the NPRs 

released in 2012. 
BNY Mellon, through its involvement in the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation, settles government 

securities transactions on a net basis for payment and 

delivery through the Fed wire system. As a result, at 

Dec. 31, 2012, the assets and liabilities of BNY 

Mellon were reduced by $137 million for the netting 

of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase 

agreement transactions executed with the same 

counterparty under standardized Master Repurchase 

Agreements. This netting is performed in accordance 

with the Financial Accounting Standards Board 

(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 41 (ASC Topic 210-20) 

“Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain 

Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements.” 
Investment securities In the discussion of our investment securities 
portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings 

information because the information indicates the 

degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, and 

significant changes in ratings classifications for our 

investment portfolio could indicate increased credit 

risk for us and could be accompanied by a reduction 

in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.

The fair value of our investment securities portfolio 
was $100.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$81.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in the fair 

value of the investment securities portfolio primarily 

reflects larger investments in agency RMBS and state 

and political subdivision securities, as well as an 

improvement in the unrealized gain of our investment 

securities. In 2012, we received $885 million of 

paydowns and sold $98 million of sub-investment 

grade securities. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, the total investment securities 
portfolio had an unrealized pre-tax net gain of $2.4 

billion compared with $793 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The improvement in the valuation of the investment 

securities portfolio was primarily driven by a decline 

in interest rates and improved credit spreads. The 

unrealized net of tax gain on our investment securities 

available-for-sale portfolio included in accumulated 
other comprehensive income was $1.3 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012, compared with $417 million at 

Dec. 31, 2011. 
At Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, 89% of the 
securities in our portfolio were rated AAA/AA-. 
We routinely test our investment securities for OTTI. 
(See “Critical accounting estimates” for additional 

disclosure regarding OTTI.) 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $871 million of accretable 
discount related to the restructuring of the investment 

securities portfolio. The discount related to these 

transactions had a remaining average life of 

approximately 5.3 years. The accretion of discount 

related to these securities increased net interest 

revenue and was recorded on a level yield basis. The 

discount accretion totaled $281 million in 2012 and 

$391 million in 2011. 
BNY Mellon 41 
Results of Operations (continued) Also, at Dec. 31, 2012, we had $2.5 billion of net 
amortizable purchase premium relating to investment 

securities with a remaining average life of 

approximately 4.2 years. For these securities, the 

amortization of net premium decreased net interest 

revenue and is recorded on a level yield basis. We 

recorded net premium amortization of $504 million in 

2012 and $294 million in 2011.

Equity investments Our equity investments are primarily categorized as 

other assets. Included in other assets are (parenthetical 

amounts indicate carrying values at Dec. 31, 2012): 

joint ventures and other equity investments ($1.5 

billion), seed capital ($158 million), Federal Reserve 

Bank stock ($436 million), private equity investments 

($99 million), and tax advantaged low-income 

housing investments ($489 million). For additional 

information on the fair value of our private equity 

investments and certain seed capital, see Note 8 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Our equity investment in Wing Hang, which is located 
in Hong Kong, had a fair value of $651 million (book 

value of $449 million) based on its share price at 

Dec. 31, 2012. An agreement with certain other 

shareholders of Wing Hang prohibits the sale of this 

interest without their permission. We received a stock 

dividend from Wing Hang with a value of $14 million 

(or 1.5 million shares) in 2012 and a stock dividend of 

$12 million (or 1.1 million shares) in 2011. In 2010, 

we received cash dividends from Wing Hang of $6 

million. Private equity activities consist of investments in 
private equity funds, mezzanine financings, and direct 

equity investments. Consistent with our policy to 

focus on our core activities, we continue to reduce our 

exposure to these activities. The carrying and fair 

value of our private equity investments was $99 

million at Dec. 31, 2012, down $23 million from $122 

million at Dec. 31, 2011. At Dec. 31, 2012, private 

equity investments consisted of investments in private 

equity funds of $91 million, direct equity of less than 

$1 million, and leveraged bond funds of $7 million. 

Investment income was $8 million in 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $13 million of unfunded 
investment commitments to private equity funds. If 

unused, the commitments expire between 2013 and 

2017. Commitments to private equity limited partnerships 
may extend beyond the expiration period shown 

above to cover certain follow-on investments, claims 

and liabilities, and organizational and partnership 

expenses. 42? BNY Mellon

an increase of 7% from $79.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The increase in total exposure was generally broad-

based across most portfolios and reflects: 
Š loan growth in Private Wealth, margin secured 

lending to financial institutions and commercial 

real estate; and 
Š an increase in unfunded commitments resulting 

from a renewed effort to grow our Public 
Financial institutions= 
Finance portfolio as well as to continue to 

support client relationships where revenue 

growth opportunities exist. 
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios 

comprise our largest concentrated risk. These 

portfolios make up 55% of our total lending exposure. 

Additionally, a substantial portion of our overdrafts 

relate to financial institutions and commercial 

customers. The diversity of the financial institutions portfolio is shown in the following table.<

billion at Dec. 31, 2011, primarily reflecting higher 

exposure to asset managers and governments, partially 

offset by lower exposure to banks and insurance 

companies. Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 

93% of the exposures meeting the investment grade 

equivalent criteria of our rating system at Dec. 31, 

2012. These exposures are generally short-term. Of 

these exposures, 69% expire within one year, and 33% 

expire within 90 days. In addition, 42% of the 

financial institutions exposure is secured. For 

example, securities industry and asset managers often

Dec. 31, 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in

Our goal is to maintain a predominantly investment 
grade portfolio. The table below summarizes the 

percent of the financial institutions and commercial 

exposures that are investment grade.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade 

names to support cross-selling opportunities and avoid 

single name/industry concentrations. Each customer is 

assigned an internal rating grade, which is mapped to 

an equivalent external rating agency grade based upon 

a number of dimensions which are continually 

evaluated and may change over time. The execution 

of our strategy has resulted in 93% of both our 

financial institutions and commercial portfolios rated 

as investment grade at Dec. 31, 2012. 
Wealth management loans and mortgages 

Our Wealth management exposure was $10.6 billion 
at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with $8.8 billion at Dec. 

31, 2011. Wealth management loans and mortgages 

are primarily comprised of loans to high-net-worth 
individuals, which are secured by marketable 

securities and/or residential property. Wealth 

management mortgages are primarily interest-only 

adjustable rate mortgages with an average loan to 

value ratio of 63% at origination. In the wealth 

management portfolio, 1% of the mortgages were past 

due at Dec. 31, 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, the wealth management mortgage 
portfolio was comprised of the following geographic 

concentrations: New York – 22%; California – 19%; 

Massachusetts – 17%; Florida – 8%; and other – 34%. 
Commercial real estate 

Our commercial real estate facilities are focused on 
experienced owners and are structured with moderate 

leverage based on existing cash flows. Our 

commercial real estate lending activities include both 

construction facilities and medium-term loans. Our 

client base consists of experienced developers and 

long-term holders of real estate assets. Loans are 

approved on the basis of existing or projected cash 

flow, and supported by appraisals and knowledge of 

local market conditions. Development loans are 

structured with moderate leverage, and in most 

instances, involve some level of recourse to the 

developer. Our commercial real estate exposure 

totaled $3.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$3.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, 57% of our commercial real estate 
portfolio is secured. The secured portfolio is diverse 
44 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) by project type, with 55% secured by residential 
buildings, 18% secured by office buildings, 10% 

secured by retail properties, and 17% secured by other 

categories. Approximately 91% of the unsecured 

portfolio is allocated to investment grade real estate 

investment trusts (“REITs”) under revolving credit 

agreements. At Dec. 31, 2012, our commercial real estate portfolio 
is comprised of the following concentrations: New 

York metro – 46%; investment grade REITs – 41%; 

and other – 13%. 
Lease financings 

The leasing portfolio exposure totaled $2.4 billion and 
included $191 million of airline exposures at Dec. 31, 

2012 compared with $2.6 billion of leasing exposures, 

including $197 million of airline exposures, at Dec. 

31, 2011. At Dec. 31, 2012, approximately 85% of the 

leasing exposure was investment grade. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, the $2.2 billion non-airline lease 
financing portfolio consisted of exposures backed by 

well-diversified assets, primarily large-ticket 

transportation equipment. The largest component is 

rail, consisting of both passenger and freight trains. 

Assets are both domestic and foreign-based, with 

primary concentrations in the United States and 

Germany. Approximately 48% of the non-airline 

portfolio is additionally secured by highly rated 

securities and/or letters of credit from investment 

grade issuers. Excluding airline lease financing, 

counterparty rating equivalents at Dec. 31, 2012, were 

as follows: 
Š 1% of the counterparties are AA, or equivalent; 
Š 56% were A; 
Š 28% were BBB; and 
Š 15% were non-investment grade. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, our $191 million of exposure to the 

airline industry consisted of $68 million to major U.S. 

carriers, $107 million to foreign airlines and $16 

million to U.S. regional airlines. 
Despite the significant improvement in revenues and 
yields that the U.S domestic airline industry achieved 

in the past year, high fuel prices pose a significant 

challenge for these carriers. Combined with their high 

fixed cost operating models, extremely high debt 

levels and sensitivity to economic cycles, the domestic 

airlines remain vulnerable. As such, we continue to 

maintain a sizable allowance for loan losses against 

these exposures and continue to closely monitor the 

portfolio. We utilize the lease financing portfolio as part of our 

tax management strategy. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily 
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 

totaled $1,632 million at Dec. 31, 2012, compared 

with $1,923 million at Dec. 31, 2011. Included in this 

portfolio at Dec. 31, 2012 are $497 million of 

mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 

quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 

mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans. 

As of Dec. 31, 2012, the purchased loans in this 

portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 

of 75% at origination and 24% of these loans were at 

least 60 days delinquent. The properties securing the 

prime and Alt-A mortgage loans were located (in 

order of concentration) in California, Florida, 

Virginia, Maryland and the tri-state area (New York, 

New Jersey and Connecticut). 
To determine the projected loss on the prime and Alt-
A mortgage portfolio, we calculate the total estimated 

defaults of these mortgages and multiply that amount 

by an estimate of realizable value upon sale in the 

marketplace (severity). 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $12 million in subprime 
mortgages included in the other residential mortgage 

portfolio. The subprime loans were issued to support 

our Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
Overdrafts 
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities 
clearance clients. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in 

the custody and securities clearance business and are 

generally repaid within two business days. 
Other loans 

Other loans primarily included loans to consumers 
that are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds 

and fixed income securities, as well as bankers’ 

acceptances. Margin loans 
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable 
securities and borrowers are required to maintain a 

daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value 

of the loan. Margin loans included $5.1 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012 and $5.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2011 of 

loans related to a term loan program that offers fully 

collateralized loans to broker-dealers.

and fixed rate loans totaled $432 million. International loans 
We have credit relationships in the international 
markets, particularly in areas associated with our 

securities servicing and trade finance activities. 

Excluding lease financings, these activities resulted in 

outstanding international loans of $9.1 billion at Dec. 

31, 2012 and $9.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. The 

increase primarily resulted from higher overdrafts, 

partially offset by a decrease in loans to financial 

institutions. Asset quality and allowance for credit losses Over the past several years, we have improved our 
risk profile through greater focus on clients who are 

active users of our non-credit services, de=

emphasizing broad-based loan growth. Our primary 

exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of 

funded loans, unfunded formal contractual 

commitments to lend, standby letters of credit and 

overdrafts associated with our custody and securities 

clearance businesses. 
The role of credit has shifted to one that complements 
our other services instead of as a lead product. Credit 

solidifies customer relationships and, through a 

disciplined allocation of capital, can earn acceptable 

rates of return as part of an overall relationship.

Results of Operations (continued) Net charge-offs were $30 million in 2012, $75 million 
in 2011 and $68 million in 2010. Net charge-offs in 

2012 included $16 million of other residential 

mortgages primarily located in California, Florida and 

New Jersey and $13 million of loans in the financial 

institutions portfolio. Net charge-offs in 2011 

included $53 million of other residential mortgages 

primarily located in California, Florida, New York 

and New Jersey, a $10 million loan in the media 

portfolio and $6 million related to a broker-dealer 

holding company that filed for bankruptcy. Net 

charge-offs in 2010 included $44 million of other 

residential mortgages primarily located in California, 

New York and Florida, $17 million related to a 

mortgage company, partially offset by $10 million of 

net recoveries from the media portfolio. 
The provision for credit losses was a credit of 
$80 million in 2012. The provision for credit losses 

was $1 million in 2011 and $11 million in 2010. The 

credit in 2012 primarily resulted from a reduction in 

the allowance for credit losses related to the 

residential mortgage loan portfolio. Our residential 

mortgage loan portfolio has experienced better 

performance compared with aggregate industry 

historical losses. In 2012, we began using our actual 

loan loss experience rather than industry data to 

estimate the allowance for credit losses. We anticipate 

the quarterly provision for credit losses to be 

approximately $0 to $15 million in 2013. 
The total allowance for credit losses was $387 million 
at Dec. 31, 2012 and $497 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was 

primarily driven by the use of BNY Mellon’s actual 

loan loss experience used to estimate future losses 

related to the residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
The ratio of the total allowance for credit losses to 
year-end non-margin loans was 1.16% at Dec. 31, 

2012 and 1.59% at Dec. 31, 2011. The ratio of the 

allowance for loan losses to year-end non-margin 
loans was 0.80% at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

1.26% at Dec. 31, 2011. The lower ratios at Dec. 31, 

2012 compared with Dec. 31, 2011 primarily reflect 

the decrease in the allowance for credit losses related 

to the residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
We had $13.4 billion of secured margin loans on our 
balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$12.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. We have rarely 

suffered a loss on these types of loans and do not 

allocate any of our allowance for credit losses to them. 

As a result, we believe that the ratio of total allowance 

for credit losses to non-margin loans is a more 

appropriate metric to measure the adequacy of the 

reserve. Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit 
losses, as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” 

and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements, we have allocated our allowance for credit 

losses as follows:

inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 

credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 

regardless of the nature of the loss.

2012 compared with $12.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2012 

and $6.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. The decrease in 

federal funds purchased and securities sold under 

repurchase agreements in the fourth quarter of 2012 

was primarily due to a decrease in overnight rate 

opportunities at year-end. The maximum daily 

balance in fourth quarter of 2012 was $20.0 billion 

compared with $15.7 billion in the third quarter of 

2012. This increase resulted from attractive overnight 

borrowing opportunities during the fourth quarter. At 

Dec. 31, 2012, we earned revenue on securities sold 

under repurchase agreements related to certain 

securities for which we were able to charge a higher 

rate for lending them.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings 
under lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries and 

overdrafts of sub-custodian account balances in our 

Investment Services businesses. Overdrafts in these 

accounts typically relate to timing differences for 

settlements. Other borrowed funds were $1.4 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012 compared with $1.1 billion at Sept. 30, 

2012 and $2.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. Other 

borrowed funds averaged $1.4 billion in 2012, 

$1.9 billion in 2011 and $2.0 billion in 2010. The 

decreases compared with both the prior period end 

and prior year average reflect a change in the source 

of funding for our Pershing subsidiaries. 
Liquidity and dividends BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the 
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or 

convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, 

especially during periods of market stress. Liquidity 

risk is the risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash 

and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both 

expected and unexpected cash flows, without 
BNY Mellon 51 
Results of Operations (continued) adversely affecting daily operations or financial 
conditions. Liquidity risk can arise from cash flow 

mismatches, market constraints from inability to 

convert assets to cash, inability to raise cash in the 

markets, deposit run-off, or contingent liquidity 

events. For additional information on our liquidity policy, see 
“Liquidity risk” in the “Risk Management” section. 
Our overall approach to liquidity management is to 
ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 

amount and diversity such that changes in funding 

requirements at the Parent and at the various bank 

subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without 

material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 

or our financial condition. 
BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments and 

seeks to diversify funding sources by line of business, 

customer and market segment. Additionally, we seek 

to maintain liquidity ratios within approved limits and 

liquidity risk tolerance, maintain a liquid asset buffer 

that can be liquidated, financed and/or pledged as 

necessary, and control the levels and sources of 

wholesale funds. 
Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of 
customer deposits and client drawdowns on unfunded 

credit or liquidity facilities. We actively monitor 

unfunded lending-related commitments, thereby 
reducing unanticipated funding requirements. 
When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics to ensure ample liquidity for expected and 

unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 

mismatches, asset maturities, access to debt and 

money markets, debt spreads, peer ratios, liquid 

assets, unencumbered collateral, funding sources and 

balance sheet liquidity ratios. We monitor the Basel 
III liquidity coverage ratio as applied to us, based on 

our current interpretation of Basel III. Ratios we 

currently monitor as part of our standard analysis 

include total loans as a percentage of total deposits, 

deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning 

assets, foreign deposits as a percentage of total 

interest-earnings assets, purchased funds as a 

percentage of total interest-earning assets, liquid 

assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, 

liquid assets as a percentage of purchased funds, and 

discount window collateral and central bank deposits 

as a percentage of total deposits. All of these ratios 

exceeded our minimum guidelines at Dec. 31, 2012. 
We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 

under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are based 

on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under 

unlikely but plausible events. The Company performs 

these tests under various time horizons ranging from 

one day to one year in a base case, as well as 

supplemental tests to determine whether the 

Company’s liquidity is sufficient for severe market 

events and firm-specific events. Under our scenario 

testing program, the results of the tests indicate that 

the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
We define available funds as liquid funds (which 
include interest-bearing deposits with banks and 

federal funds sold and securities purchased under 

resale agreements), cash and due from banks, and 

interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and 

other central banks. The table below presents our total 

available funds including liquid funds at period end 

and on an average basis. The higher level of available 

funds at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with Dec. 31, 2011 

resulted from a higher level of client deposits, 

partially offset by the redeployment of funds on our 

balance sheet from interest-bearing deposits with the 

Federal Reserve and other central banks as we 

increased the level of our securities portfolio.

Results of Operations (continued) On an average basis for 2012 and 2011, non-core 
sources of funds such as money market rate accounts, 

certificates of deposit greater than $100,000, federal 

funds purchased, trading liabilities and other 

borrowings were $21.5 billion and $17.2 billion, 

respectively. The increase primarily reflects higher 

levels of money market rate accounts, federal funds 

purchased and commercial paper, partially offset by 

lower levels of trading liabilities and other 

borrowings. Average foreign deposits, primarily from 

our European-based Investment Services business, 

were $90.9 billion in 2012 compared with 

$83.8 billion in 2011. The increase primarily reflects 

growth in client deposits. Domestic savings and other 

time deposits averaged $35.5 billion in 2012 

compared with $36.2 billion in 2011. Deposit volumes 

could be impacted by proposed money market fund 

reform. Average payables to customers and broker-dealers 
were $8.0 billion in 2012 and $7.3 billion in 2011. 

Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven 

by customer trading activity and market volatility. 

Long-term debt averaged $19.9 billion in 2012 and 

$18.1 billion in 2011. The increase in average long=

term debt was driven by planned capital actions and 

anticipated maturities. Average noninterest-bearing 

deposits increased to $70.0 billion in 2012 from 

$58.0 billion in 2011 reflecting growth in client 

deposits. A significant reduction in our Investment 

Services business would reduce our access to deposits. 
The Parent has four major sources of liquidity: 
Š cash on hand; 
Š dividends from its subsidiaries; 
Š access to the commercial paper market; and 
Š access to the long-term debt and equity markets. 
Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2012, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 

approximately $2.7 billion without the need for a 

regulatory waiver. Including the impact of the 

approximately $850 million charge related to the 

Feb. 11, 2013 U.S. Tax Court ruling, dividend paying 

capacity at our bank subsidiaries would decrease to 

$1.9 billion. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2012, non-bank 

subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 

approximately $1.4 billion. In 2012, BNY Mellon paid a quarterly cash dividend 
of $0.13 per common share. The Federal Reserve’s 

current guidance provides that, for large bank holding 

companies like us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 
30% of after-tax net income will receive particularly 

close scrutiny. BNY Mellon’s common stock dividend 

payout ratio was 26% in 2012. 
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our 
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in 

“Supervision and Regulation – Capital Planning-

Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other 

Capital Distributions” and in Note 20 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In 2012 and 2011, the Parent’s average commercial 
paper borrowings were $819 million and $98 million, 

respectively. The Parent had cash of $4.0 billion at 

Dec. 31, 2012, compared with $4.6 billion at Dec. 31, 

2011. In addition to issuing commercial paper for 

funding purposes, the Parent issues commercial paper, 

on an overnight basis, to certain custody clients with 

excess demand deposit balances. Overnight 

commercial paper outstanding issued by the Parent 

was $338 million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $10 million at 

Dec. 31, 2011. Net of commercial paper outstanding, 

the Parent’s cash position at Dec. 31, 2012, decreased 

by $902 million compared with Dec. 31, 2011, 

primarily reflecting increased loans to subsidiaries, 

which replaced external funding sources, and share 

repurchases. The Parent’s major uses of funds are payment of 
dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal 

and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions 

and additional investments in its subsidiaries. 
In 2012, we repurchased 49.8 million common shares 
in the open market at an average price of $22.38 per 

share for a total of $1.12 billion. 
The Parent’s liquidity policy is to have sufficient cash 
on hand to meet its obligations over the next 18 to 

24 months without the need to receive dividends from 

its bank subsidiaries or issue debt. As of Dec. 31, 

2012, the Parent was in compliance with its liquidity 

policy. In addition to our other funding sources, we also have 
the ability to access the capital markets. In June 2010, 

we filed shelf registration statements on Form S-3 

with the SEC covering the issuance of certain 

securities, including an unlimited amount of debt, 

common stock, preferred stock and trust preferred 

securities, as well as common stock issued under the 

Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment 

Plans. These registration statements will expire in 

June 2013, at which time we plan to file new shelf 

registration statements.

Results of Operations (continued) Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable 
terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit 

ratings, which, as of Dec. 31, 2012, were as follows:

As a result of Moody’s and S&P’s government 
support assumptions on U.S. financial institutions, the 

Parent’s Moody’s and S&P ratings benefit from one 

notch of “lift”. Similarly, The Bank of New York 

Mellon’s and BNY Mellon, N.A.’s ratings benefit 

from two notches of “lift” from Moody’s and one 

notch of “lift” from S&P. 
In March 2012, Moody’s downgraded BNY Mellon’s 
long-term senior and subordinated debt and trust-

preferred securities ratings as well as the long-term 

debt and deposit ratings of the bank subsidiaries. The 

Parent’s long-term senior debt rating declined from 

Aa2 to Aa3. The long-term senior debt ratings of both 

The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, 

N.A. declined from Aaa to Aa1. All short-term ratings 
for BNY Mellon were affirmed at Prime-1 and are 

unaffected by this action. 
In 2013, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and DBRS reaffirmed 
all of our credit ratings. 
Long-term debt decreased to $18.5 billion at Dec. 31, 
2012 from $19.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, primarily 

due to the maturity of $3.2 billion of senior debt and 

$300 million of subordinated debt, as well as the 

redemption of $1.1 billion of junior subordinated 

debentures, partially offset by the issuance of 

$3.25 billion of senior debt, summarized in the 

following table.

mature in 2013 and has the option to call $407 million 

of subordinated debt in 2013, which it may call and 

refinance if market conditions are favorable. 
At Dec. 31, 2011, our trust preferred securities 
included $500 million of Fixed-to-Floating Rate 

Normal Preferred Capital Securities (“PCS”) issued 

by Mellon Capital IV. As contractually obligated 

under the terms of the PCS, a remarketing occurred in 

May 2012. In this remarketing, junior subordinated 

notes issued by BNY Mellon and held by Mellon 

Capital IV were sold to third party investors and then 

exchanged for BNY Mellon’s senior notes, which 

were sold in a public offering. The proceeds of the 

sale of the senior notes were used to fund the purchase 

by Mellon Capital IV of $500 million of BNY 

Mellon’s Series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred 

stock (“Series A preferred stock”), which was issued 

on June 20, 2012. As a result of the remarketing, the 

PCS are expected to pay distributions at a rate per 

annum equal to the greater of (i) three-month LIBOR 

plus 0.565% for the related distribution period; or 

(ii) 4.000%. In 2012, BNY Mellon issued 23.3 million depositary 

shares (the “Series C Depositary Shares”), each 

representing a 1/4,000th interest in a share of BNY 

Mellon’s Series C Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred 

Stock (the “Series C preferred stock”). The proceeds 

of the offering totaled $568 million, net of issuance 

costs. BNY Mellon will pay dividends on the Series C 

preferred stock, if declared by our board of directors, 

at an annual rate of 5.2%. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $623 million of trust 
preferred securities outstanding that qualify as Tier 1 

capital, including $300 million that are currently 

callable. On Nov. 26, 2012, BNY Mellon redeemed 

all outstanding 6.875% Trust Preferred Securities, 

Series E, issued by BNY Capital IV (liquidation 

amount $25 per security and $200 million in the 

aggregate) and all outstanding 5.95% Trust Preferred 
54 BNY Mellon 
Results of Operations (continued) Securities, Series F, issued by BNY Capital V 
(liquidation amount $25 per security and $350 million 

in the aggregate). Any decision to take action with 

respect to the remaining trust preferred securities will 

be based on several considerations including interest 

rates, the availability of cash and capital, as well as 

the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-

Frank Act” or “Dodd-Frank”). 
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of investment in 
subsidiaries divided by our consolidated equity, which 

included our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock 

plus trust preferred securities. Our double leverage 

ratio was 109.9 % at Dec. 31, 2012 and 107.3% at 

Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in the ratio primarily 

reflects greater retained capital at our bank 

subsidiaries. The double leverage ratio is monitored 

by regulators and rating agencies and is an important 

constraint on our ability to invest in our subsidiaries 

and expand our businesses. 
Pershing LLC, an indirect subsidiary of BNY Mellon, 
has committed and uncommitted lines of credit in 

place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by 

the Parent. The committed line of credit of $750 

million extended by 17 financial institutions matures 

in March 2013. Average daily borrowings against 

these lines was $51 million in 2012. Pershing LLC has 

nine separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting 

to $1.6 billion in aggregate. Average daily borrowing 

under these lines was $237 million, in aggregate, 

during 2012. 
The committed line of credit maintained by Pershing 
LLC requires the Parent to maintain: 
Š shareholders’ equity of $10 billion; 
Š a ratio of Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for 

credit losses to nonperforming assets of at least 

2.5; and 
Š a double leverage ratio less than 130%. 
We are currently in compliance with these covenants.<

Statement of cash flows 

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion 
in 2012 compared to $2.2 billion in 2011 and $4.1 

billion in 2010. In 2012, cash flows from operations 

were principally the result of earnings, partially offset 

by changes in trading activities. In 2011 and 2010, the 

cash flows from operations were principally the result 

of earnings. 
In 2012, cash used for investing activities was $29.4 
billion compared to $80.2 billion in 2011 and $14.9 

billion in 2010. In 2012, purchases of securities, and 

increases in interest-bearing deposits with banks, 

partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of 

securities, were significant uses of funds. In 2011, 

increases in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal 

Reserve and other central banks, and the purchase of 

securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest-

bearing deposits with banks and sales, paydowns and 

maturities of securities, were significant uses of funds. 

In 2010, purchases of securities available-for-sale, an 

increase in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal 

Reserve and other central banks, and the Acquisitions, 

partially offset by sales, paydowns and maturities of 

securities, were a significant use of funds. 
In 2012, cash provided by financing activities was 
$28.3 billion compared with $78.8 billion in 2011 and 

$10.8 billion in 2010. In 2012, changes in deposits 

and payables to customers and broker dealers were 

significant sources of funds. In 2011, changes in 

deposits and payables to customers and broker-dealers 

and proceeds from issuances of long-term debt were 

significant sources of funds. In 2010, change in 

deposits, federal funds purchased and securities sold 

under repurchase agreements and other funds 

borrowed were significant sources of funds.

shareholders’ equity increased compared with 

Dec. 31, 2011. The increase primarily reflects 

earnings retention, the issuance of $1.1 billion of 

noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, net of 

issuance costs and the increased value of our 

investment securities portfolio, partially offset by 

share repurchases. 
During 2012, we repurchased 49.8 million common 
shares in the open market, at an average price of 

$22.38 per common share for a total of $1.12 billion. 

Our capital plan for 2012 authorized the repurchase of 

up to $1.16 billion worth of common shares, or no 

more than $290 million per quarter, including both 

open market purchases and employee benefit plan 

repurchases, from the second quarter of 2012 through 

the first quarter of 2013. Accordingly, in the first 

quarter of 2013, we continued to repurchase common 

shares under the 2012 capital plan. Through Feb. 27, 

2013, we repurchased 7.8 million common shares in 

the open market at an average price of $27.21 per 

common share for a total of $211 million. 
The unrealized net of tax gain on our available-for=

sale investment securities portfolio recorded in 

accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.3 

billion at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with $417 million 

at Dec. 31, 2011. The increase in the valuation of the 

investment securities portfolio was driven by a decline 

in interest rates and improved credit spreads. 
Capital adequacy 

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank 
holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon 

and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 

established quantitative measurements. For the Parent 

to maintain its status as a financial holding company, 

our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among 

other things, qualify as “well capitalized”. 
As of Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011, BNY Mellon and our 
bank subsidiaries were considered “well capitalized” 

on the basis of the Basel I Total and Tier 1 capital to 

risk-weighted assets ratios and the leverage ratio 

(Basel I Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets as 

defined for regulatory purposes).

ratio. (c)< When in this Annual Report we refer to BNY Mellon’s or our bank subsidiary’s “Basel I” capital measures (e.g., Basel I Total capital 

or Basel I Tier 1 capital), we mean Total or Tier 1 capital, as applicable, as calculated under the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital 

guidelines that are based on the 1988 Basel Accord, which is often referred to as “Basel I”. 
N/A – Not applicable at the consolidated company level. Well capitalized and adequately capitalized have not been defined for Basel III. 
Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio 
was 9.8% at Dec. 31, 2012 based on the NPRs and final 

market risk rule. The increase in the ratio from 7.1% at 

Dec. 31, 2011, which was calculated under prior Basel 

III guidance and the proposed market risk rule, was 

primarily due to a reduction in risk-weighted assets 

related to the treatment of sub-investment grade 

securities under the NPRs, earnings retention and an 

increase in the value of the investment portfolio, 

partially offset by balance sheet growth in 2012. We 

expect the charge related to the Feb. 11, 2013 U.S. Tax 

Court ruling will decrease the Basel III Tier 1 common 

equity ratio by approximately 55 basis points. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, the amounts of capital by which 
BNY Mellon and our largest bank subsidiary, The 

Bank of New York Mellon, exceed the “well 

capitalized” guidelines are as follows.

and “Risk Factors-Operational and Business Risk-

Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including “well 

capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital 

adequacy guidelines more generally, could result in 

limitations on our activities and adversely affect our 

financial condition.” 
The Basel I Tier 1 capital ratio varies depending on 
the size of the balance sheet at quarter-end and the 

level and types of investments. The balance sheet size 

fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on levels of 

customer and market activity. In general, when 

servicing clients are more actively trading securities, 

deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are 

higher. In addition, when markets experience 

significant volatility or stress, our balance sheet size 

may increase considerably as client deposit levels 

increase. 58? BNY Mellon

capital ratio was unchanged as earnings retention and 

the issuance of $1.1 billion of noncumulative 

perpetual preferred stock, net of issuance costs were 

offset by share repurchases, the repayment of trust 

preferred securities and higher risk-weighted assets. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, our Basel I risk-weighted assets 
were $111 billion compared with $102 billion at Dec. 

31, 2011. The increase in risk-weighted assets was 

primarily driven by higher investment securities, loans 

and interest-bearing deposits with banks. 
Our Basel I Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.3% at Dec. 31, 
2012 compared with 5.2% at Dec. 31, 2011. The 

leverage ratio of The Bank of New York Mellon was 

5.4% at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 5.3% at Dec. 

31, 2011. The improvement in the leverage ratio of 

BNY Mellon reflects the factors mentioned above. 

The improvement in the leverage ratio of The Bank of 

New York Mellon resulted from earnings retention.

of the PCS, we remarketed these securities in 2012. 

See “Liquidity and Dividends” for additional 

information on the remarketing and issuance of Series 

A as well as the issuance of our Series C preferred 

stock. The Series A and Series C preferred stock 

qualify as Tier 1 capital under the recently released 

NPRs. At Dec. 31, 2012, we had $623 million of trust 
preferred securities outstanding that qualify as Tier 1 

capital, including $300 million that are currently 

callable. Any decision to take action with respect to 

the remaining trust preferred securities will be based 

on several considerations including interest rates, the 

availability of cash and capital, as well as the 

implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.

shares of common stock. On March 22, 2011, the 

Board of Directors of BNY Mellon authorized the 

repurchase of up to an additional 13 million shares of 

common stock. On Feb. 14, 2012, in order to continue 

with share repurchases under our 2011 capital plan, 

the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an 

additional 12 million shares of common stock, of 

which 6.8 million shares of common stock remain 

available for repurchase under the Feb. 2012 board 

authorization. While there are no expiration dates on 

the prior share repurchase authorizations, BNY 

Mellon does not intend to use the prior authorizations 

for any future share repurchases. On March 13, 2012, 

in connection with the Federal Reserve’s non-

objection to our 2012 capital plan, the Board of 

Directors authorized a new stock purchase program 

providing for the repurchase of an aggregate of $1.16 

billion of common stock. The new share repurchase 

program may be executed through open market 

purchases or privately negotiated transactions at such 

prices, times and upon such other terms as may be 

determined from time to time. There is no expiration 

date on the share repurchase authorizations. In 2012, 

we repurchased 49.8 million common shares in the 

open market, at an average price of $22.38 per share 

for a total of $1.12 billion. 
Trading activities and risk management Our trading activities are focused on acting as a 
market maker for our customers and facilitating 

customer trades. Positions managed for our own 

account are immaterial to our foreign exchange and 

other trading revenue and to our overall results of 

operations. The risk from market-making activities for 

customers is managed by our traders and limited in 

total exposure through a system of position limits, a 

value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on a Monte 
Carlo simulation, stop loss advisory triggers, and 

other market sensitivity measures. See Note 24 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 

additional information on the VaR methodology.

Results of Operations (continued) The foreign exchange component of VaR represents 
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the 

level or volatility of currency exchange rates or 

interest rates. These instruments include, but are not 

limited to: currency balances, spot and forward 

transactions, currency options, and exchange traded 

futures and options, and other currency derivative 

products. The equity component of VaR is comprised of 
instruments that represent an ownership interest in the 

form of domestic and foreign common stock or other 

equity-linked instruments. These instruments include, 

but are not limited to: common stock, exchange traded 

funds, American Depositary Receipts, listed equity 

options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity 

total return swaps, equity index futures and other 

equity derivative products. 
The diversification component of VaR is the risk 
reduction benefit that occurs when combining 

portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the 

correlated behavior of risk factor movements. 
During 2012, interest rate risk generated 74% of 
average VaR, equity risk generated 14% of average 

VaR and foreign exchange risk accounted for 12% of 

average VaR. During 2012, our daily trading loss did 

not exceed our calculated VaR amount of the overall

=(a) Distribution of trading revenues (losses) does not reflect the 
impact of the CVA and corresponding hedge. Foreign exchange and other trading Under our mark-to-market methodology for derivative 
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is 

performed on each position assuming time-

discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition, 

we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of 

our derivatives. 
As required by ASC 820 – 
Fair Value Measurements 
and Disclosures, we reflect external credit ratings as 
well as observable credit default swap spreads for 

both ourselves as well as our counterparties when 

measuring the fair value of our derivative positions. 

Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions 

is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit 

spreads, as well as those of our counterparties. In 

addition, in cases where a counterparty is deemed 

impaired, further analyses are performed to value such 

positions. At Dec. 31, 2012, our over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivative assets of $5.1 billion included a CVA 

deduction of $103 million, including $7 million 

related to the credit quality of certain CDO 

counterparties and Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. 

(“Lehman”). Our OTC derivative liabilities of $7.0 

billion included a debit valuation adjustment (“DVA”) 

of $29 million related to our own credit spread. Net of 

hedges, the CVA decreased $80 million and the DVA 

decreased $16 million in 2012. The net impact of 

these adjustments increased foreign exchange and 

other trading revenue by $64 million in 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2011, our OTC derivative assets of $7.0 
billion included a CVA deduction of $182 million, 

including $8 million related to the credit quality of 

certain CDO counterparties and Lehman. Our OTC 

derivative liabilities of $7.4 billion included a DVA of 

$46 million related to our own credit spread. Net of 

hedges, the CVA increased $11 million and the DVA 

was unchanged in 2011. The net impact of these 

adjustments decreased foreign exchange and other 

trading revenue by $11 million in 2011. In 2011, we 

charged-off a $15 million realized loss against the 

CVA reserves.

Asset/liability management Our diversified business activities include processing 

securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities, 

lending, raising money as needed to fund assets, and 

other transactions. The market risks from these 

activities are interest rate risk and foreign exchange 

risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to 

movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain 

foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage 

interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation 

and discounted cash flow models to identify interest 

rate exposures. 
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used 
to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue. The 

model incorporates management’s assumptions 

regarding interest rates, balance changes on core 

deposits, market spreads, changes in the prepayment 

behavior of loans and securities and the impact of 

derivative financial instruments used for interest rate 

risk management purposes. These assumptions have 

been developed through a combination of historical 

analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are 

inherently uncertain. As a result, the earnings 

simulation model cannot precisely estimate net 

interest revenue or the impact of higher or lower 

interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results 

may differ from projected results due to timing, 

magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, and 

changes in market conditions and management’s 

strategies, among other factors. 
These scenarios do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 

interest rate expectations change. The table below relies 

on certain critical assumptions regarding the balance 

sheet and depositors’ behavior related to interest rate 
fluctuations and the prepayment and extension risk in 

certain of our assets. To the extent that actual behavior 

is different from that assumed in the models, there 

could be a change in interest rate sensitivity. 
We evaluate the effect on earnings by running various 
interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario. 

These scenarios are reviewed to examine the impact 

of large interest rate movements. Interest rate 

sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in 

pre-tax net interest revenue between the scenarios 

over a 12-month measurement period. 
The following table shows net interest revenue 
sensitivity for BNY Mellon: 
Estimated changes in net interest revenue 
at Dec. 31, 2012 

(dollar amounts in millions) up 200 bps parallel rate shift vs. baseline 
(a) $607 up 100 bps parallel rate shift vs. baseline 
(a) 435 Long-term up 50 bps, short-term unchanged 
(b) 128 Long-term down 50 bps, short-term unchanged 
(b) (93) (a)< In the parallel rate shift, both short-term and long-term rates 
move equally. 
(b)< Long-term is equal to or greater than one year. The 100 basis point ramp scenario assumes short-term 
rates increase 25 basis points in each of the next four 

quarters and the 200 basis point ramp scenario 

assumes a 50 basis point per quarter increase. 
Our net interest revenue sensitivity table above 
incorporates assumptions about the impact of changes 

in interest rates on depositor behavior based on 

historical experience. Given the exceptionally low 

interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates could 

lead to higher depositor withdrawals than historically 

experienced. BNY Mellon 63 
Results of Operations (continued) Growth or contraction of deposits could also be 
affected by the following factors: 
Š Global economic uncertainty, particularly in 

Europe; Š Our ratings relative to other financial 

institutions’ ratings; and 
Š Money market mutual fund reform. 
Any of these events could change our assumptions 

about depositor behavior and have a significant 

impact on our balance sheet and net interest revenue. 
We also project future cash flows from our assets and 
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount 

these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks 

to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the 

structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by 

discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of 

these discounted cash flows is the Economic Value of 

Equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how the 

EVE would change in response to changes in interest 

rates: Estimated changes in EVE at Dec. 31, 2012 
Rate change: up 200 bps vs. baseline (0.2)% up 100 bps vs. baseline 0.3% These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 

interest rate expectations change. 
The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact 
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may 

create a situation in which an increase in interest rates 

can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory 

capital, even though economically there may be no 

impact on our economic capital position. For example, 

an increase in rates will result in a decline in the value 

of our fixed income investment portfolio, which will 
be reflected through a reduction in other 

comprehensive income in our shareholders’ equity, 

thereby affecting our tangible common equity 

(“TCE”) ratios. Under current accounting rules, to the 

extent the fair value option provided in ASC 825 is 

not applied, there is no corresponding change on our 

fixed liabilities, even though economically these 

liabilities are more valuable as rates rise. 
We project the impact of this change using the same 
interest rate shock assumptions described earlier and 

compare the projected mark-to-market on the 

investment securities portfolio at Dec. 31, 2012, under 

the higher rate environments versus a stable rate 

scenario. The table below shows the impact of a 

change in interest rates on the TCE ratio: 
Estimated changes in the TCE ratio at Dec. 31, 2012 
(in basis points) 
up 200 bps vs. baseline (121) up 100 bps vs. baseline (57) These results do not reflect strategies that 
management could employ to limit the impact as 

interest rate expectations change. 
To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign 
currency-denominated assets with liability instruments 

denominated in the same currency. We utilize various 

foreign exchange contracts if a liability denominated 

in the same currency is not available or desired, and to 

minimize the earnings impact of translation gains or 

losses created by investments in foreign markets. The 

foreign exchange risk related to the interest rate 

spread on foreign currency-denominated asset/liability 

positions is managed as part of our trading activities. 

We use forward foreign exchange contracts to protect 

the value of our net investment in foreign operations. 

At Dec. 31, 2012, net investments in foreign 

operations totaled approximately $10 billion and were 

spread across 13 foreign currencies.

Risk managementRisk management overview 
Governance 
Risk management and oversight begins with the 
Board of Directors and two key Board committees: 

the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. 
The Risk Committee is comprised entirely of 
independent directors and meets on a regular basis to 

review and assess the control processes with respect to 

the Company’s inherent risks. They also review and 

assess the risk management activities of the Company 

and the Company’s fiduciary risk policies and 

activities. Policy formulation and day-to-day oversight 

of the Risk Management Framework is delegated to 

the Chief Risk Officer, who, together with the Chief 

Auditor and Chief Compliance Officer, helps ensure 

an effective risk management governance structure. 

The roles and responsibilities of the Risk Committee 

are described in more detail in its charter, a copy of 

which is available on our website, 
www.bnymellon.com. The Audit Committee is also comprised entirely of 
independent directors, all of whom are financially 

literate within the meaning of the NYSE listing 

standards, and one of whom has been determined to 

be an audit committee financial expert as set out in the 

rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange 

Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), with 

accounting or related financial management expertise 

within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards. All 

members of the Audit Committee have been 

determined to have banking and financial 

management expertise within the meaning of the 

FDIC rules. The Audit Committee meets on a regular 

basis to perform an oversight review of the integrity 

of the financial statements and financial reporting 

process, compliance with legal and regulatory 

requirements, our independent registered public 

accountant’s qualifications and independence, and the 

performance of our registered public accountant and 

internal audit function. The Audit Committee also 

reviews management’s assessment of the adequacy of 

internal controls. The functions of the Audit 

Committee are described in more detail in its charter, 

a copy of which is available on our website, 
www.bnymellon.com. The Senior Risk Management Committee (“SRMC”) 
is the most senior management body responsible for 

ensuring that emerging risks are weighed against the 

corporate risk appetite and that any material 
amendments to the risk appetite statement are 

properly vetted and recommended to the Executive 

Committee and the Board for approval. The SRMC 

also reviews any material breaches to our risk appetite 

and approves action plans required to remediate the 

issue. SRMC provides oversight for the risk 

management, compliance and ethics framework. The 

Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Chief 

Financial Officer are among SRMC’s members. 
Risk appetite statement 

BNY Mellon defines risk appetite as the level of risk it 
is normally willing to accept while pursuing the 

interests of our major stakeholders, including our 

clients, shareholders, employees and regulators. The 

Company has adopted the following as its risk appetite 

statement: “Risk taking is a fundamental characteristic 

of providing financial services and arises in every 

transaction we undertake. Our risk appetite is driven by 

the fact that our Company is the global leader in 

providing services that enable the management and 

servicing of financial assets in more than 100 markets 

worldwide and has been designated by international 

regulators as one of the 29 Global Systemically 

Important Financial Institutions (“G-SIFIs”). This 

designation recognizes our fundamental importance to 

the health and operation of the global capital markets 

and carries with it a responsibility to maintain the 

highest standards of excellence. As a result, we are 

committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet 

throughout market cycles and to delivering operational 

excellence to meet the expectations of our major 

stakeholders, including our clients, shareholders, 

employees and regulators. The balance sheet will be 

characterized by strong liquidity, superior asset quality, 

ready access to external funding sources at competitive 

rates and a strong capital structure that supports our risk 

taking activities and is adequate to absorb potential 

losses. These characteristics support our goal of having 

superior debt ratings among our peers. To that end, the 

Company’s Risk Management Framework has been 

designed to: 
Š ensure that appropriate risk tolerances (“limits”) 

are in place to govern our risk taking activities 

across all businesses and risk types; 
Š ensure that our risk appetite principles permeate 

the Company’s culture and are incorporated into 

our strategic decision-making processes; 
Š ensure rigorous monitoring and reporting of key 

risk metrics to senior management and the 

Board of Directors; and 
Š ensure that there is an on-going, and forward-

looking, capital planning process to support our 

risk taking activities.” BNY Mellon 65 
Risk management (continued) Primary risk types 
The understanding, identification and management of 
risk are essential elements for the successful 

management of BNY Mellon. Our primary risk 

categories are: 
Type of risk Description Operational/ business The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 

failed internal processes, human factors and 

systems, breaches of technology and 

information systems, or from external events. 

Also includes fiduciary risk, reputational risk, 

and litigation risk. 
Market The risk of loss due to adverse changes in the 

financial markets. Our market risks are 

primarily interest rate, foreign exchange, and 

equity risk. Market risk particularly impacts our 

exposures that are marked-to-market such as the 

securities portfolio, trading book, and equity 

investments. Credit The possible loss we would suffer if any of our 

borrowers or other counterparties were to 

default on their obligations to us. Credit risk is 

resident in the majority of our assets, but 

primarily concentrated in the loan and securities 

books, as well as off-balance-sheet exposures 

such as lending commitments, letters of credit, 

and securities lending indemnifications. 
Liquidity The risk that BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash 

and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost 

for both expected and unexpected cash flows, 

without adversely affecting daily operations or 

financial conditions. Liquidity risk can arise 

from cash flow mismatches, market constraints 

from inability to convert assets to cash, inability 

to raise cash in the markets, deposit run-off, or 

contingent liquidity events. Thus, liquidity risk 

can be inherent in the majority of our balance 

sheet exposures. The following table presents the primary type of risk 
typically embedded in on-and off-balance-sheet 

instruments. Risks of our on-and off-balance-sheet instruments

Operational/business risk Overview In providing a comprehensive array of products and 
services, we may be exposed to operational/business 

risk. Operational/business risk may result from, but is 

not limited to, errors related to transaction processing, 

breaches of internal control systems and compliance 

requirements, fraud by employees or persons outside 

BNY Mellon or business interruption due to system 

failures or other events. Operational/business risk may 

also include breaches of our technology and 

information systems resulting from unauthorized 

access to confidential information or from internal or 

external threats, such as cyber attacks. Operational/ 

business risk also includes potential legal or 

regulatory actions that could arise as a result of 

noncompliance with applicable laws and/or regulatory 

requirements. In the case of an operational event, we 

could suffer a financial loss as well as damage to our 

reputation. To address these risks, we maintain comprehensive 
policies and procedures and an internal control 
66 BNY Mellon 
Risk management (continued) framework designed to provide a sound operational 
environment. These controls have been designed to 

manage operational/business risk at appropriate levels 

given our financial strength, the business environment 

and markets in which we operate, the nature of our 

businesses, and considering factors such as 

competition and regulation. Our internal auditors and 

internal control group monitor and test the overall 

effectiveness of our internal controls and financial 

reporting systems on an ongoing basis. 
We have also established procedures that are designed 
to ensure compliance with generally accepted 

conduct, ethics and business practices which are 

defined in our corporate policies. These include 

training programs such as for our “Code of Conduct,” 

and “Know Your Customer” programs, and 

compliance training programs such as those regarding 

information protection, suspicious activity reporting, 

and operational risk. 
Operational/business risk management 

We have established operational/business risk 
management as an independent risk discipline. The 

Operational Risk Management (“ORM”) Group and 

Information Risk Management (“IRM”) Group reports 

to the Chief Risk Officer. The organizational 

framework for operational/business risk is based upon 

a strong risk culture that incorporates both governance 

and risk management activities comprising: 
ŠBoard Oversight and Governance – The Risk 

Committee of the Board approves and oversees 

our operational/business risk management 

strategy in addition to credit and market risk. 

The Risk Committee meets regularly to review 

and approve operational/business risk 

management initiatives, discuss key risk issues, 

and review the effectiveness of the risk 

management systems. 
ŠAccountability of Businesses – Business< 

managers are responsible for maintaining an< 

effective system of internal controls< 

commensurate with their risk profiles and in< 

accordance with BNY Mellon policies and< 

procedures.< ŠORM Group – The ORM Group is responsible 

for developing risk management policies and 

tools for assessing, measuring, monitoring and 

managing operational risk for BNY Mellon. The 

primary objectives of the ORM group are to 

promote effective risk management, identify 

emerging risks, create incentives for generating 

continuous improvement in controls, and to 

optimize capital. ŠIRM Group – The IRM Group is responsible for 

developing policies and tools for identifying, 

assessing, measuring and monitoring 

information and technology risk for BNY 

Mellon. The IRM Group partners with the 

businesses to focus on three primary areas: 

access, information protection, and technology 

controls. The primary objectives of the IRM 

Group are to help maintain and protect the 

confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the 

firm’s information and technology assets from 

internal and external threats such as cyber 

attacks. Market risk In addition to the Risk Committee and SRMC, 

oversight of market risk is performed by certain 

committees and through executive review meetings. 

Detailed reviews of derivative trading positions and of 

all model validations/stress tests results are conducted 

during the Global Markets Weekly Risk Review. 

Senior managers from Risk Management, Finance and 

Sales and Trading attend the review. 
Regarding the Treasury function, oversight is 
provided by the Treasury Risk Committee, bi-weekly 

Portfolio Management Group risk meetings, Business 

Risk meetings, and numerous portfolio reviews. 
Business Risk meetings for the Global Markets and 
Capital Markets businesses also provide a forum for 

market risk oversight. The goal of Business Risk 

meetings, which are held at least quarterly, is to 

review key risk and control issues and related 

initiatives facing all lines of business including Global 

Markets and Capital Markets. The following activities 

are also addressed during Business Risks meetings: 
Š Reporting of all new Monitoring Limits and 

changes to existing limits; 
Š Monitoring of trading exposures, VaR, market 

sensitivities and stress testing results; and 
Š Reporting results of all model validations. 
The Derivatives Documentation Committee reviews 

and approves variations in the Company’s 

documentation standards as it relates to derivative 

transactions. In addition, this committee reviews all 

outstanding confirmations to identify potential 

exposure to the Company. Finally, the Risk 

Quantification and Modeling Committee validates and 

reviews back-testing results. 
BNY Mellon 67 
Risk management (continued) Credit risk To balance the value of our activities with the credit 
risk incurred in pursuing them, we set and monitor 

internal credit limits for activities that entail credit 

risk, most often on the size of the exposure and the 

maximum maturity of credit extended. For credit 

exposures driven by changing market rates and prices, 

exposure measures include an add-on for such 

potential changes. We manage credit risk at both the individual exposure 
level as well as at the portfolio level. Credit risk at the 

individual exposure level is managed through our 

credit approval system of Credit Portfolio Managers 

(“CPMs”) and the Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”). The 

CPMs and CCO are responsible for approving the 

size, terms and maturity of all credit exposures as well 

as the ongoing monitoring of the exposures. In 

addition, they are responsible for assigning and 

maintaining the risk ratings on each exposure. 
Credit risk management at the portfolio level is 
supported by Enterprise Risk Architecture (“ERA”), 

within the Risk Management and Compliance Sector. 

The ERA is responsible for calculating two 

fundamental credit measures. First, we project a 

statistically probable credit loss, used to help 

determine the appropriate loan loss reserve and to 

measure customer profitability. Credit loss considers 

three basic components: the estimated size of the 

exposure whenever default might occur, the 

probability of default before maturity and the severity 

of the loss we would incur, commonly called “loss 

given default.” For corporate banking, where most of 

our credit risk is created, unfunded commitments are 

assigned a usage given default percentage. Borrowers/ 

Counterparties are assigned ratings by CPMs and the 

CCO on an 18-grade scale, which translate to a scaled 

probability of default. Additionally, transactions are 

assigned loss-given-default ratings (on a 12-grade 

scale) that reflect the transactions’ structures including 

the effects of guarantees, collateral, and relative 

seniority of position. 
The second fundamental measurement of credit risk 
calculated by the ERA is called economic capital. Our 

economic capital model estimates the capital required 

to support the overall credit risk portfolio. Using a 

Monte Carlo simulation engine and measures of 

correlation among borrower defaults, the economic 

model examines extreme and highly unlikely 

scenarios of portfolio credit loss in order to estimate 

credit-related capital, and then allocates that capital to 

individual borrowers and exposures. The credit-

related capital calculation supports a second tier of 
policy standards and limits by serving as an input to 

both profitability analysis and concentration limits of 

capital at risk with any one borrower, industry or 

country. The ERA is responsible for the calculation 
methodologies and the estimates of the inputs used in 

those methodologies for the determination of expected 

loss and economic capital. These methodologies and 

input estimates are regularly evaluated to ensure their 

appropriateness and accuracy. As new techniques and 

data become available, the ERA attempts to 

incorporate, where appropriate, those techniques or 

data. Credit risk is intrinsic to much of the banking 
business. However, BNY Mellon seeks to limit both 

on-and off-balance sheet credit risk through prudent 

underwriting and the use of capital only where risk-

adjusted returns warrant. We seek to manage risk and 

improve our portfolio diversification through 

syndications, asset sales, credit enhancements, credit 

derivatives, and active collateralization and netting 

agreements. In addition, we have a separate Credit 

Risk Review group, which is part of Internal Audit, 

made up of experienced loan review officers who 

perform timely reviews of the loan files and credit 

ratings assigned to the loans. 
Liquidity risk Our overall approach to liquidity management is to 
ensure that sources of liquidity are sufficient in 

amount and diversity such that changes in funding 

requirements at the Parent and at the various bank 

subsidiaries can be accommodated routinely without 

material adverse impact on earnings, daily operations 

or our financial condition. 
The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for 
the liquidity risk of the Company and approves the 

liquidity risk tolerances. The Asset Liability 

Committee (“ALCO”) is the senior management 

committee responsible for the oversight of liquidity 

management. ALCO is responsible to ensure that 

Board approved strategies, policies, and procedures 

for managing liquidity are appropriately executed. 

Senior management is also responsible for regularly 

reporting the liquidity position of the Company to the 

Board of Directors. The Treasury Risk Committee is 

responsible for reviewing liquidity stress tests and 

various liquidity metrics including contractual cash 

flow gaps for liquidity, foreign exchange, liquidity 

stress metrics and ratios, Liquidity Coverage Ratio, 

Net Stable Funding Ratio and client deposit 
68 BNY Mellon 
Risk management (continued) concentration. The Treasury Risk Committee 
approves and validates stress test methodologies and 

assumptions. BNY Mellon seeks to maintain an adequate liquidity 
cushion in both normal and stressed environments and 

seeks to diversify funding sources by line of business, 

customer and market segment. Additionally, we seek 

to maintain liquidity ratios within approved limits and 

liquidity risk tolerance, maintain a liquid asset buffer 

that can be liquidated, financed and/or pledged as 

necessary, and control the levels and sources of 

wholesale funds. 
Potential uses of liquidity include withdrawals of 
customer deposits and client drawdowns on unfunded 

credit or liquidity facilities. We actively monitor 

unfunded lending-related commitments, thereby 
reducing unanticipated funding requirements. 
When monitoring liquidity, we evaluate multiple 
metrics to ensure ample liquidity for expected and 

unexpected events. Metrics include cashflow 

mismatches, asset maturities, access to debt and 

money markets, debt spreads, peer ratios, liquid 

assets, unencumbered collateral, funding sources and 

balance sheet liquidity ratios. We monitor the Basel 

III liquidity coverage ratio as applied to us, based on 

our current interpretation of Basel III. Ratios we 

currently monitor as part of our standard analysis 

include total loans as a percentage of total deposits, 

deposits as a percentage of total interest-earning 

assets, foreign deposits as a percentage of total 

interest-earnings assets, purchased funds as a 

percentage of total interest-earning assets, liquid 

assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, 

liquid assets as a percentage of purchased funds, and 

discount window collateral and central bank deposits 

as a percentage of total deposits. All of these ratios 

exceeded our minimum guidelines at Dec. 31, 2012. 
We also perform liquidity stress tests to ensure the 
Company maintains sufficient liquidity resources 

under multiple stress scenarios. Stress tests are based 

on scenarios that measure liquidity risks under 

unlikely but plausible events. The Company performs 

these tests under various time horizons ranging from 

one day to one year in a base case, as well as 

supplemental tests to determine whether the 

Company’s liquidity is sufficient for severe market 

events and firm-specific events. Under our scenario 

testing program, the results of the tests indicate that 

the Company has sufficient liquidity. 
Stress Testing It is the policy of the company to perform Enterprise-

wide Stress Testing at regular intervals as part of its 

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 

(“ICAAP”). Additionally, the Company performs an 

analysis of capital adequacy in a stressed environment 

in its Enterprise-wide Stress Test Framework, as 

required by the enhanced prudential standards issued 

pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing performs analysis 
across the company’s Lines of Business, products, 

geographic areas, and risk types incorporating the 

results from the different underlying models and 

projections given a certain stress-test scenario. It is an 

important component of assessing the adequacy of 

capital (as in the ICAAP) as well as identifying any 

high risk touch points in business activities. 

Furthermore, by integrating enterprise-wide stress 

testing into the company’s capital planning process, 

the results provide a forward-looking evaluation of the 

ability to complete planned capital actions in a more=

adverse-than-anticipated economic environment. 
Economic capital required BNY Mellon has implemented a methodology to 
quantify economic capital. We define economic 

capital as the capital required to protect against 

unexpected economic losses over a one-year period at 

a level consistent with the solvency of a target debt 

rating. We quantify economic capital requirements for 

the risks inherent in our business activities using 

statistical modeling techniques and then aggregate 

them at the consolidated level. A capital reduction, or 

diversification benefit, is applied to reflect the 

unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss 

in each type of risk at the same time. Economic 

capital requirements are directly related to our risk 

profile. As such, it has become a part of our internal 

capital adequacy assessment process and, along with 

regulatory capital, is a key component to ensuring that 

the actual level of capital is commensurate with our 

risk profile, and is sufficient to provide the financial 

flexibility to undertake future strategic business 

initiatives. The framework and methodologies to quantify each of 
our risk types have been developed by the ERA and 

are designed to be consistent with our risk 

management principles. The framework has been 

approved by senior management and has been 

reviewed by the Risk Committee of the Board of 

Directors. Due to the evolving nature of quantification 
BNY Mellon 69 
Risk management (continued) techniques, we expect to continue to refine the 
methodologies used to estimate our economic capital 

requirements. The following table presents our economic capital 
required at Dec. 31, 2012, on a consolidated basis.

Global compliance Our global compliance function provides leadership, 
guidance, and oversight to help our businesses 

identify applicable laws and regulations and 

implement effective measures to meet the specific 

requirements. Compliance takes a proactive approach 

by anticipating evolving regulatory standards and 
remaining aware of industry best practices, legislative 

initiatives, competitive issues, and public expectations 

and perceptions. The function uses its global reach to 

disseminate information about compliance-related 

matters throughout BNY Mellon. The Chief 

Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Chief 

Risk Officer, is a member of key committees of BNY 

Mellon and provides regular updates to the Audit and 

Risk Committees of the Board of Directors. 
Internal audit Internal Audit is an independent, objective assurance 
function that reports directly to the Audit Committee 

of the Company’s Board of Directors. It assists the 

Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing 

a systematic, disciplined, risk-based approach to 

evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the 

Company’s risk management, control, and governance 

processes. The scope of Internal Audit’s work 

includes the review and evaluation of the adequacy, 

effectiveness, and sustainability of risk management 

procedures, internal control systems, information 

systems and governance processes. 
70 BNY Mellon 
Risk FactorsMaking or continuing an investment in securities 
issued by us, including our common stock, involves 

certain risks that you should carefully consider. The 

following discussion sets forth the most significant 

risk factors that could affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. However, other 

factors, besides those discussed below, or in other of 

our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, also 

could adversely affect our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. We cannot assure 

you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere 

in our reports address all potential risks that we may 

face. These risk factors also serve to describe factors 

which may cause our results to differ materially from 

those described in forward-looking statements 

included herein or in other documents or statements 

that make reference to this Annual Report. See 

“Forward-looking Statements.” 
Operational and Business Risk We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, including regulation and supervision in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may limit our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions and violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment, and are 
subject to a comprehensive statutory and regulatory 

regime as well as oversight by governmental agencies. 

In light of the current conditions in the global 

financial markets and economy, the Obama 

Administration, Congress and regulators have 

increased their focus on the regulation of the financial 

services industry. New or modified regulations and 

related regulatory guidance, including under Basel III 
(and the related NPRs) and the Dodd-Frank Act, may 
have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the 
financial services industry. We are also required to 
submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan 
outlining our planned capital actions for the following 
year. Our ability to take capital actions, including our 
ability to make acquisitions, declare dividends or 

repurchase our common stock, is subject to Federal 

Reserve approval, which is dependent on our 

successful demonstration that such actions would not 

adversely affect our regulatory capital position in the 

event of a stressed market environment. For example, 

any increase in quarterly dividends not contemplated 
in the annual capital plan will also require Federal 
Reserve approval. The Federal Reserve’s current 
guidance provides that, for large bank holding 
companies (“BHCs”) like us, common stock dividend 
payout ratios exceeding 30% of after-tax net income 
will receive particularly close scrutiny. In addition, 
the implementation of certain regulations with regard 
to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect 
our regulatory capital position relative to that of our 
competitors, including those who may not be subject 
to the same regulatory requirements, which could put 
further pressure on the price of our common stock. 
Finally, in October 2012, U.S. regulatory agencies 

finalized regulations implementing stress testing 

requirements required under the Dodd-Frank Act, 

requiring us to undergo regulatory stress tests 

conducted by the Federal Reserve annually, and to 

conduct our own internal stress tests pursuant to 

regulatory requirements twice annually. 
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies 
could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil 
money penalties and reputational damage, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operations. Although 
we have policies and procedures designed to prevent 
any such violations, there can be no assurance that 
such violations will not occur. If violations do occur, 
they could damage our reputation, increase our legal 

and compliance costs, and ultimately adversely impact 

our results of operations. Laws, regulations or policies 

currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change 

at any time. Regulatory authorities may also change 

their interpretation of these statutes and regulations. 

Therefore, our business may also be adversely 

affected by future changes in laws, regulations, 

policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to 
compliance and enforcement. See “Supervision and 
Regulation” in this Annual Report. 
Recent legislative and regulatory actions may have an adverse effect on our operations. In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the 
Dodd-Frank Act. This law broadly affects the financial 
services industry, particularly those entities considered to 
be “systemically important”, such as BHCs with assets 
of over $50 billion, including BNY Mellon, by 

establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight, 

creating a liquidation authority, mandating higher capital 

and liquidity requirements, requiring banks to pay 

increased fees to regulatory agencies and numerous 

other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound 

operation of the financial services sector. Further, in 

November 2012, the Basel Committee and the Financial 

Stability Board indicated that we were provisionally 
assigned to the 1.5% global systemically important 
banks (“G-SIBs”) capital surcharge bucket, which 
remains subject to interpretation and implementation by 
BNY Mellon 71 
Risk Factors (continued) U.S. regulatory authorities. Additionally, in its proposed 
rules regarding systemically important financial 

institutions, the Federal Reserve indicated that it intends 

to propose, in a separate rulemaking, a Tier 1 common 

equity surcharge for G-SIBs based on the Basel 

Committee’s proposal. 
Among numerous other provisions of recent 
legislative and regulatory changes that could have an 

effect on BNY Mellon are: 
Šthe Basel Committee’s heightened capital and 

liquidity requirements, including the related U.S. 

notices of proposed rulemaking; 
Šthe potential requirement to register as a 

“municipal advisor”. Depending upon the SEC’s 

final interpretation of the statutory requirement, 

BNY Mellon and a large number of employees 

located throughout the country may be required 

to register as a municipal adviser, which would 

impose increased costs and burdens on, and 

changes to, our business and may necessitate a 

re-evaluation of the affected services; 
Šrequirements designed to provide for the orderly 

resolution of certain large financial institutions, 

including requirements to submit resolution 

plans, which if found to be deficient could 

subject BNY Mellon to more stringent capital, 

leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on 

growth, activities or operations, or divestiture of 

assets or operations; 
Šcurrent proposals designed to enhance money 

market fund regulation, including requiring 

capital support or reserves, limitations on 

redemptions, and requiring money market funds 

to price their shares at net asset value; 
Šthe Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure 

Reform’s review of the risks in the tri-party repo 

market, and associated recommendations; 
Šthe required registration of swap dealers and 

associated compliance duties, reporting and 

record-keeping with respect to swaps and 

clearing and execution obligations, among other 

duties; and 
Švarious features of the “Volcker Rule” element 

of the Dodd-Frank Act, including: 
–? establishment of a costly heightened 

compliance regime; 
–? the need to liquidate investments in certain 

funds at an accelerated pace at unfavorable 

pricing; and 
–? preclusion from launching new funds to meet 

customer demand, and the competitive 

disadvantage vis-à-vis other managers not 

subject to the Volcker Rule. 
U.S. regulatory agencies – banking, securities and 
commodities – are steadily publishing notices of 

proposed regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act, 

and new bodies created by Dodd-Frank (including the 

FSOC and the CFPB) are commencing operations. 

The related findings of various regulatory and 

commission studies, the interpretations issued as part 

of the rulemaking process and the final regulations 

that are issued with respect to various elements of the 

new law may cause changes that impact the 

profitability of our business activities and require that 

we change certain of our business practices and plans, 

including those relating to cross-selling our products 

and services. These changes could also expose us to 

additional regulatory costs and require us to invest 

significant management attention and resources to 

make any necessary changes, all of which could 

impact our profitability. See “Supervision and 

Regulation” in this Annual Report for additional 

information regarding the potential impact of the 

Dodd-Frank Act on our business. 
Adverse publicity, regulatory actions or litigation with respect to us, other well-known companies and the financial services industry generally could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our businesses or reputation. We are subject to reputational, legal and regulatory 
risk in the ordinary course of our business. The 2008 

financial crisis and current political and public 

sentiment regarding financial institutions have 

resulted in a significant amount of adverse media 

coverage of financial institutions. Harm to our 

reputation can result from numerous sources, 

including adverse publicity arising from events in the 

financial markets, our perceived failure to comply 

with legal and regulatory requirements, the purported 

actions of our employees or alleged financial 

reporting irregularities involving ourselves or other 

large and well-known companies. Additionally, a 

failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and 

quality or a failure to appropriately describe our 

products and services can result in customer 

dissatisfaction, lost revenue, higher operating costs 

and litigation. Actions by the financial services 

industry generally or by other members of or 

individuals in the financial services industry can also 

negatively impact our reputation. For example, public 

perception that some consumers may have been 

treated unfairly by financial institutions has damaged 

the reputation of the financial services industry as a 

whole. Should any of these or other events or factors 

that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no 

assurance that the additional costs and expenses that 
72 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise 
to the reputational harm would not adversely affect 

our earnings and results of operations. 
We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, 
lawsuits and proceedings by counterparties, clients, 

other third parties and regulatory and other 

governmental agencies in the United States and 

abroad, as well as the Department of Justice and state 

attorneys general. See “Legal proceedings” in Note 23 

of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

in this Annual Report for a discussion of material 

legal and regulatory proceedings in which we are 

involved. Responding to such inquiries, 

investigations, lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of 

the ultimate outcome of the matter, is time-consuming 

and expensive and can divert the attention of our 

senior management from our business. The outcome 

of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or 

estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last 

several years. 
Actions brought against us may result in lawsuits, 
enforcement actions, injunctions, settlements, 

damages, fines or penalties, which could have a 

material adverse effect on our financial condition or 

results of operations or require changes to our 

business. Claims for significant monetary damages are 

often asserted in many of these legal actions, while 

claims for disgorgement, penalties and/or other 

remedial sanctions may be sought in regulatory 

matters. Although we establish accruals for our 

litigation and regulatory matters in accordance with 

applicable accounting guidance when those matters 

proceed to a stage where they present loss 

contingencies that are both probable and reasonably 

estimable, nonetheless there may be a possible 

exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. 

Any or all of these risks could result in increased 

regulatory supervision and affect our ability to attract 

and retain customers or maintain access to the capital 

markets. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny 

and legal proceedings can also adversely impact the 

morale and performance of our employees. 
Continued litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings involving our foreign exchange standing instruction program and resulting adverse publicity could affect our reputation and negatively impact our foreign exchange business. Beginning in 2009, our foreign exchange standing 
instruction program became the subject of litigation 

and regulatory investigations and proceedings. See 

“Legal proceedings” in Note 23 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. These litigation and regulatory investigations 

and proceedings have generated substantial scrutiny 

of, and adverse publicity concerning, our foreign 

exchange standing instruction program. Continued 

litigation involving our foreign exchange standing 

instruction program, and the resulting scrutiny and 

adverse publicity, could affect our reputation and 

discourage clients from doing business with us. For 

example, these proceedings have resulted in the loss 

of Ohio public fund custody clients, which has 

attracted media attention and led to inquiries from 

other clients, investors and employees. If we continue 

to be subject to these proceedings and the resulting 

adverse publicity relating to our foreign exchange 

standing instruction program, our reputation could be 

further affected, adversely impacting our business and 

results of operations. For example, pressure on pricing 

may cause our foreign exchange revenue to decline. 

See “Foreign exchange and other trading revenue” in 

the MD&A – Results of Operations section of this 

Annual Report for more information regarding our 

foreign exchange business, including business 

practices, results of operations and trends. 
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or capital adequacy guidelines more generally, could result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and 
other regulatory requirements, BNY Mellon and our 

subsidiary banks and broker-dealers must meet 

guidelines that include quantitative measures of 

assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, 

subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about 

components, risk weightings and other factors. As 

discussed under “Supervision and Regulation” in this 

Annual Report, BNY Mellon is regulated as a BHC 

and a financial holding company (“FHC”). Our ability 

to maintain our status as an FHC is dependent upon a 

number of factors, including our U.S. depository 

institution subsidiaries qualifying on an ongoing basis 

as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under the 

banking agencies’ prompt corrective action 

regulations and upon BNY Mellon qualifying on an 

ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well 

managed” under applicable Federal Reserve 

regulations. Failure by BNY Mellon or one of our 

U.S. bank subsidiaries to qualify as “well capitalized” 
and “well managed”, if unremedied over a period of 

time, would cause us to lose our status as an FHC and 

could affect the confidence of clients in us, 

compromising our competitive position. Additionally, 
BNY Mellon 73 
Risk Factors (continued) an FHC that does not continue to meet all the 
requirements for FHC status could lose the ability to 

undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are 

not generally permissible for BHCs without FHC 

status or to continue such activities. 
The Bank of New York Mellon is required to maintain 
a leverage ratio of at least 5% in order to maintain its 

“well capitalized” status, and BNY Mellon manages 

its leverage ratio to a similar level. The leverage ratio 

measures the ratio of Basel I Tier 1 capital to quarterly 

average consolidated total assets, as defined under 

Basel I regulatory guidelines. During periods of 

market uncertainty, our balance sheet size may 

increase considerably when custody customers choose 

to hold cash balances in our bank subsidiaries in a 

“flight to safety.” Such inflows of cash deposits 

increase The Bank of New York Mellon’s quarterly 

average consolidated total assets and, absent remedial 

actions, could adversely impact its leverage ratio. 
Our bank subsidiaries are also subject to capital 
requirements, administered by the Federal Reserve in 

the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the 

OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, 

BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York 

Mellon Trust Company, National Association. Failure 

by one of our bank subsidiaries to maintain its status 

as “well capitalized” could lead to, among other 

things, higher FDIC assessments. A further failure by 

BNY Mellon or one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to 

maintain its status as “adequately capitalized” would 

lead to regulatory sanctions and limitations and could 

lead the federal banking agencies to take “prompt 

corrective action.” 
If our company, our subsidiary banks or broker-
dealers failed to meet these minimum capital 

guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may 

not be able to deploy capital in the operation of our 

business or distribute capital to stockholders, which 

may adversely affect our business. The capital 

requirements applicable to us as well as to our 

subsidiary banks are in the process of being 

substantially revised, in connection with Basel III and 

the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and BNY 

Mellon, and our subsidiary banks will be required to 

satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy 

standards. We cannot fully predict the final form, or 

the effects, of these regulations. See “Supervision and 

Regulation” and the “Liquidity and dividends” and 

“Capital – Capital adequacy” sections in the MD&A – 

Results of Operations section in this Annual Report. 
Our business may be materially adversely affected by operational risk. We are exposed to operational risk as a result of 
conducting various fee-based services including 

certain securities servicing, global payment services, 

private banking and asset management services. 

Examples of operational risk include: the risk of loss 

resulting from errors related to transaction processing, 

breaches of the internal control system and 

compliance requirements, fraud by employees or 

persons outside BNY Mellon, business interruption 

due to system failures, natural disasters or other 

events, or other risk of loss resulting from inadequate 

or failed internal processes, people and systems or 

from external events. Operational risk may also 

include breaches of our technology and information 

systems resulting from unauthorized access to 

confidential information or from internal or external 

threats, such as cyber attacks. Operational risk also 

includes potential legal or regulatory actions that 

could arise as a result of non-compliance with 

applicable laws, regulatory requirements or contracts 

which could have an adverse effect on our reputation. 
An important aspect of managing our operational risk 
is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully 

understand that there is risk in every aspect of our 

business and the importance of managing risk as it 

relates to their job functions. We continue to enhance 

our risk management program to support our risk 

culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate 

to our role as a major financial institution. 

Nonetheless, if we fail to create the appropriate 

environment that sensitizes all of our employees to 

managing risk, our business could be adversely 

impacted. We regularly assess and monitor 

operational risk in our business and provide for 

disaster and business recovery planning, including 

geographical diversification of our facilities. 

However, the occurrence of various events, including 

unforeseeable and unpreventable events such as 

systems failures or natural disasters, could damage our 

physical facilities or our computer systems or 

software, cause delay or disruptions to operational 

functions, impair our clients, vendors and 

counterparties and ultimately negatively impact our 

results of operations due to potentially higher 

expenses and lower revenues. For a discussion of 

operational risk see “Risk management – Operational/ 

business risk” and “Business Continuity” in the 

MD&A – Results of Operations section in this Annual 

Report. 74 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Management regularly reviews and updates our 
internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, 

and corporate governance policies and procedures. 

Any system of controls, however well designed and 

operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and 

can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances 

that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure 

or circumvention of our controls and procedures or 

failure to comply with regulations related to controls 

and procedures could have a material adverse effect 

on our business, results of operations and financial 

condition. If we identify material weaknesses in our 

internal control over financial reporting or are 

otherwise required to restate our financial statements, 

we could be required to implement expensive and 

time-consuming remedial measures and could lose 

investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness 

of our financial reports. 
If our information systems experience a disruption or breach in security that results in a loss of confidential client information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We rely on communications and information systems 
to conduct our business. Our businesses that rely 

heavily on technology, such as our Investment 

Services and clearing businesses, are particularly 

vulnerable to security breaches and technology 

disruptions. While our information systems have been 

subjected to cyber threats, including hacker attacks, 

viruses, denial of service efforts and unauthorized 

access attempts, we deploy a broad range of 

sophisticated defenses and we have avoided a material 

breach. The security of our computer systems, 

software and networks, and those functions that we 

may outsource, may continue to be subjected to cyber 

threats that could result in failures or disruptions in 

our business. Despite our efforts to ensure the 

integrity of our systems and information, it is possible 

that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement 

effective preventive measures against all cyber 

threats, especially because the techniques used change 

frequently or are not recognized until launched, and 

because security attacks can originate from a wide 

variety of sources, including outside third parties such 

as persons who are involved with organized crime or 

associated with external service providers or who may 

be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign 
governments. Those parties may also attempt to 

fraudulently induce employees, customers or other 

users of our systems to disclose sensitive information 

in order to gain access to our data or that of our 

customers or clients. 
Breaches of security may occur through intentional or 
unintentional acts by those having authorized or 

unauthorized access to our systems or our clients’ or 

counterparties’ confidential information, including 

employees and customers, as well as hackers. A 

breach of security that results in the loss of 

confidential client information may require us to 

reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and 

credit monitoring efforts, may result in loss of 

customer business, would be costly and time-

consuming, and may negatively impact our results of 

operations and reputation. Additionally, security 

breaches or disruptions of our information systems, or 

those of our service providers, could impact our 

ability to provide services to our clients, which could 

expose us to liability for damages, result in the loss of 

customer business, damage our reputation, subject us 

to regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation, 

any of which could have a material adverse effect on 

our financial condition and results of operations. In 

addition, the failure to upgrade or maintain our 

computer systems, software and networks, as 

necessary, could also make us susceptible to breaches 

and unauthorized access and misuse. There can be no 

assurance that any such failures, interruptions or 

security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, 

that they will be adequately addressed. We may be 

required to expend significant additional resources to 

modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or 

other exposures arising from information systems 

security risks. Furthermore, even if not directed at us 

specifically, attacks on other large financial 

institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the 

financial system to the detriment of other financial 

institutions, including us. 
As a result of the importance of communications and 
information systems to our business, we could also be 

adversely affected if attacks affecting the third party 

providers of our communications services impair our 

ability to process transactions and communicate with 

customers and counterparties. For a discussion of 

operational risk, see “Risk management – 

Operational/business risk” and “Business Continuity” 

in the MD&A – Results of Operations section in this 

Annual Report. 
BNY Mellon 75 
Risk Factors (continued) We depend on our technology; if we fail to update our technology our business may be adversely affected. We are dependent on technology because many of our 
products and services involve processing large 

volumes of data. Our technology platforms must 

therefore provide global capabilities and scale. Rapid 

technological changes require significant and ongoing 

investments in technology to develop competitive new 

products and services or adopt new technologies. 

Technological advances which result in lower 

transaction costs may adversely impact our revenues. 

In addition, unsuccessful implementation of 

technological upgrades and new products may 

adversely impact our ability to service and retain 

customers. Developments in the securities processing industry, 
including shortened settlement cycles and straight=

through-processing, will necessitate ongoing changes 

to our business and operations and will likely require 

additional investment in technology. Our financial 

performance depends in part on our ability to develop 

and market new and innovative services, to adopt or 

develop new technologies that differentiate our 

products or provide cost efficiencies and to deliver 

these products and services to the market in a timely 

manner at a competitive price. 
Rapid technological change in the financial services 
industry, together with competitive pressures, require 

us to make significant and ongoing investments. We 

cannot provide any assurance that our technology 

spending will achieve gains in competitiveness or 

profitability, and the costs we incur in product 

development could be substantial. Accordingly, we 

could incur substantial development costs without 

achieving corresponding gains in profitability. 
Furthermore, if a third party were to assert a claim of 
infringement or misappropriation of its proprietary 

rights, obtained through patents or otherwise, against us 

with respect to one or more of our products, systems, or 

methods of doing business or conducting our 

operations, we could be required to spend significant 

amounts to defend such claims, develop alternative 

methods of operations, pay substantial money damages 

or obtain a license from the third party. 
Change or uncertainty in monetary, tax and other governmental policies may impact our profitability and ability to compete. The monetary, tax and other policies of the 
government and its agencies, including the Federal 
Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates 

and overall financial market performance. The Federal 

Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in 

the United States and its policies determine in large 

part our cost of funds for lending, investing and 

capital raising activities and the return we earn on 

those loans and investments, both of which affect our 

net interest margin. The actions of the Federal 

Reserve also can materially affect the value of 

financial instruments we hold, and its policies also can 

affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk 

that they may fail to repay their loans. The Federal 

Reserve has been engaging in quantitative economic 

easing since 2008. In late 2012, the Federal Reserve 

announced “QE3” and “QE4” programs to buy 

mortgaged backed securities and long-term U.S. 

Treasury securities until such time as certain criteria 

relating to unemployment and inflation are met. These 

policies have resulted in some reduction in nominal 

yield and accelerated run-off on certain interest-

earning assets. To the extent that we are not able to 

manage our reinvestment risk relating to the impact of 

these monetary policies, our net interest revenue could 

be adversely affected. 
Our business and earnings may also be adversely 
affected by the monetary, tax and other governmental 

policies that are adopted by various U.S. regulatory 

authorities, non-U.S. governments and international 

agencies. Changes in monetary, tax and other 

governmental policies could impose additional 

compliance, legal, review and response costs that may 

impact our profitability and may allow additional 

competition, facilitate consolidation of competitors, or 

attract new competitors into our businesses. Changes 

in monetary, tax and other governmental policies are 

beyond our control and difficult to predict and we 

cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such 

changes would have upon our business, financial 

condition or results of operations. 
We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Many businesses in which we operate are intensely 
competitive around the world. Competitors include 

other banks, trading firms, broker dealers, investment 

banks, asset managers, insurance companies and a 

variety of other financial services and advisory 

companies whose products and services span the 

local, national and global markets in which we 

conduct operations. In addition, technological 

advances and the growth of internet-based commerce 

have made it possible for other types of institutions, 
76 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) such as outsourcing companies and data processing 
companies, to offer a variety of products and services 

competitive with certain areas of our business. 

Increased competition in any one or all of these areas 

may require us to make additional capital investments 

in our businesses in order to remain competitive. 
Furthermore, pricing pressures, as a result of the 
ability of competitors to offer comparable or improved 

products or services at a lower price and customer 

pricing reviews, particularly in our asset servicing 

businesses, may result in a reduction in the price we 

can charge for our products and services, which could 

negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase 

our profitability. 
Recently enacted and proposed legislation and 
regulation may impact our ability to conduct certain of 

our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all, 

including legislation relating to restrictions on the 

types of activities in which financial institutions are 

permitted to engage, such as seed capital investing. 

See “Supervision and Regulation” in this Annual 

Report. This legislation and other regulations may not 

apply to all of our competitors, which could adversely 

impact our ability to compete effectively. A decline in 

our competitive position could adversely affect our 

ability to maintain or increase our profitability. 
New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks, and the failure to grow our existing businesses could affect our results of operations. From time to time, we may implement new lines of 
business or offer new products and services within 

existing lines of business. There are substantial risks 

and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We 

invest significant time and resources in developing 

and marketing new lines of business, products and 

services. Initial timetables for the introduction and 

development of new lines of business and/or new 

products or services may not be achieved and price 

and profitability targets may not be met or prove 

feasible. Our revenues and costs may fluctuate 

because generally new businesses require start-up 

expenses but take time for revenues to develop. As a 

result of the uncertainties associated with the entry 

into new businesses, our business may be adversely 

impacted. In addition, our internal strategies and forecasts may 
assume a growing client base and increasing client 

usage of our services across business lines. A decline 

in the pace at which we attract new clients and a 
decline in the pace at which existing and new clients 

use additional services and assign additional assets to 

us for management or custody could adversely affect 

our future results of operations. A decline in the rate 

at which our clients outsource functions could also 

adversely affect our results of operations. 
Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to 
attract new employees, retain and motivate our 

existing employees, and continue to compensate our 

employees competitively amid intense public and 

regulatory scrutiny of the compensation practices of 

large financial institutions. Competition for the best 

employees in most activities in which we engage can 

be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will 

be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key 

personnel. Factors that affect our ability to attract and 

retain key employees include our compensation and 

benefits programs, our profitability and our reputation 

for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. 

Our ability to attract and retain key executives and 

other employees may be hindered as a result of 

regulations applicable to incentive compensation and 

other aspects of our compensation programs 

promulgated by the Federal Reserve and other 

regulators in the United States and worldwide, 

regulations on incentive compensation to be 

promulgated by various U.S. regulators pursuant to 

the Dodd-Frank Act and other existing and potential 

regulations. These regulations, which include and are 

expected to include mandatory deferral and clawback 

requirements, do not and will not apply to some of our 

competitors and to other institutions with which we 

compete for talent. Our ability to recruit and retain 

key talent may be adversely affected by these 

regulations. In addition, aspects of our compensation 

programs are performance-based. If we do not achieve 

applicable performance thresholds for a relevant 

period, employee compensation may be adversely 

affected. We are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating globally and which may adversely affect our business. 
In conducting our business and maintaining and 
supporting our global operations, we are subject to 

risks of loss from the outbreak of hostilities and 

various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other 

developments, including social or political instability, 

changes in governmental policies or policies of central 
BNY Mellon 77 
Risk Factors (continued) banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of 
assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange 

controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Our 

international businesses are regulated in the 

jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. 

These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to 

non-domestic companies, which can reduce our 

flexibility as to intercompany transactions, 

investments and other aspects of business operations 

and adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and 

regulatory capital. The failure to properly mitigate 

such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support 

such international activities could result in operational 

failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could 

cause our earnings or stock price to decline. Further, 

our businesses and operations from time to time enter 

into new regions throughout the world, including 

emerging markets. Various emerging market countries 

have experienced severe economic and financial 

disruptions, including significant devaluations of their 

currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on 

sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange 

controls, and low or negative growth rates in their 

economies. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, 

and a lack of an established legal and regulatory 

framework are additional challenges in certain 

emerging markets. Revenue from international 

operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other 

obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as 

a result of the above considerations. The possible 

effects of any of these conditions may adversely affect 

our business and increase volatility in global financial 

markets generally. 
Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, global 
conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could 

have a negative impact on our business and 

operations. While we have in place business 

continuity and disaster recovery plans, such events 

could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the 

normal operations of our business (including 

communications and technology), result in harm or 

cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a 

similar impact on our clients, suppliers and 

counterparties. These events could also negatively 

impact the purchase of our products and services to 

the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced 

capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or 

disruptions in general economic activity in the United 

States or abroad, or in financial market settlement 

functions. For example, in October 2012 several of 
our facilities in the northeastern U.S. were impacted 

by Superstorm Sandy and the New York Stock 

Exchange was closed for two trading days. While our 

business continuity plans functioned well and we did 

not experience a material financial impact from the 

storm, nonetheless the recovery required significant 

resources and we experienced some lost revenue 

opportunities. War, terror attacks, political unrest, 

global conflicts, the national and global efforts to 

combat terrorism and other potential military activities 

and outbreaks of hostilities may negatively impact 

economic growth, which could have an adverse effect 

on our business and operations, and may have other 

adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to 

predict. Our failure to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives, 
we have acquired or invested in other companies or 

businesses, and may do so in the future. Each 

acquisition poses integration challenges, including 

successfully retaining and assimilating clients and key 

employees, capitalizing on certain revenue synergies, 

integrating the acquired company’s accounting 

management information, internal controls and other 

administrative systems and technology. We may be 

required to spend a significant amount of time and 

resources to integrate these acquisitions and the 

anticipated benefits may take longer to achieve than 

projected. Additionally, for a period of time after an 

acquisition we may be required to use the seller’s 

technology systems until we are able to convert the 

acquired business to our own technology systems. In 

the event that such technology conversion takes 

longer than anticipated, we may incur significant costs 

for the continued usage of the seller’s technology. 

Moreover, to the extent we enter into an agreement to 

buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the 

transaction will close when anticipated, or at all. In 

particular, in certain instances we must seek 

regulatory approvals before we can acquire another 

organization, which can delay or disrupt such 

acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate 

strategic acquisitions on a timely basis or in a cost-

effective manner, we may not meet our expectations 

regarding the profitability of such acquisitions, which 

could have an adverse impact on our business, 

financial condition and results of operations. 
78 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) Market Risk The ongoing Eurozone crisis, the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties in Europe, or a breakup of the European Monetary Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The financial markets remain concerned about the 
ability of certain European countries, particularly 

Greece, Ireland and Portugal, but also others such as 

Spain and Italy, to finance their deficits and service 

growing debt burdens amidst difficult economic 

conditions. This loss of confidence has led to rescue 

measures for Greece, Ireland and Portugal by 

Eurozone countries and the International Monetary 

Fund as well as the newly established European 

Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank’s 

Outright Monetary Transactions program to stabilize 

Eurozone governments. Despite these efforts, yields 

on government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, 

including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, 

have remained volatile. The actions required to be 

taken by those countries as a condition to rescue 

packages, and by other countries to mitigate similar 

developments in their economies, have resulted in 

increased political discord within and among 

Eurozone countries. We are primarily exposed to 

disruptions in European markets in three principal 

areas – on our balance sheet, in certain interest 

bearing deposits with banks, loans, trading assets and 

investment securities, as well as our Investment 

Management and Investment Services fee revenue. 

Additionally, continued disruptions in Europe could 

lead to increased client deposits and a larger balance 

sheet, which could adversely impact our leverage 

ratio. For additional information regarding our 

exposure, please see “International Operations – 

Exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and 

Greece” in the MD&A – Results of Operations section 

in this Annual Report. 
The partial or full break-up of the European Monetary 
Union would be unprecedented and its impact highly 

uncertain. The exit of one or more countries from the 

European Monetary Union or the dissolution of the 

European Monetary Union could lead to 

redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in 

exiting countries. Any such exit and redenomination 

would cause significant uncertainty with respect to 

outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors 

in any exiting country, whether sovereign or 

otherwise, and lead to complex and lengthy disputes 

and litigation. The resulting uncertainty and market 

stress could also cause, among other things, severe 
disruption to equity markets, significant increases in 

bond yields generally, potential failure or default of 

financial institutions, including those of systemic 

importance, a significant decrease in global liquidity, 

a freeze-up of global credit markets and a potential 

worldwide recession. The interdependencies among European economies 
and financial institutions have contributed to concerns 

regarding the stability of European financial markets 

generally and certain institutions in particular. 

Financial services institutions are interdependent as a 

result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other 

relationships. We routinely execute transactions with 

European counterparties, including brokers and 

dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual 

and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a 

result, defaults or non-performance by, or even 

rumors or questions about, one or more European 

financial institutions, or the financial markets 

generally, have in the past led to market-wide 

liquidity problems and could lead to losses by us or by 

other institutions in the future. Given the scope of our 

European operations, clients and counterparties, 

persistent disruptions in the European financial 

markets, the attempt of a country to abandon the Euro, 

the failure of a significant European financial 

institution, even if not an immediate counterparty to 

us, or persistent weakness in the Euro could have a 

material adverse impact on our business or results of 

operations. Continuing uncertainty in financial markets and weakness in the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
Our results of operations may be materially affected 
by conditions in the domestic and global financial 

markets and the economy generally, both in the 

United States and elsewhere around the world. A 

variety of factors raise concern over the course and 

strength of the economic recovery, including 

depressed home prices and continuing foreclosures, 

volatile equity market values, high unemployment, 

governmental budget deficits (including, in the United 

States, at the federal, state and municipal level), 

contagion risk from possible default by other 

countries on sovereign debt, declining business and 

consumer confidence and the risk of increased 

inflation. The resulting economic pressure on 

consumers and lack of confidence in the financial 

markets may adversely affect certain portions of our 

business, financial condition and results of operations. 

A worsening of these conditions would likely 
BNY Mellon 79 
Risk Factors (continued) exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market 
conditions on us and others in the financial services 

industry. In particular, we face the following risks in 

connection with these events, some of which are 

discussed at greater length in separate risk factors: 
ŠThe fees earned by our Investment Management 

business – that is, Asset Management and Wealth 

Management – are higher as assets under 

management increase. Those fees are also 

impacted by the composition of the assets under 

management, with higher fees for some asset 

categories as compared to others. Uncertain and 

volatile capital markets could result in reductions 

in assets under management because of 

investors’ decisions to withdraw assets or from 

simple declines in the value of assets under 

management as markets decline. Uncertain and 

volatile financial markets may also result in 

changes in customer allocations of funds among 

money market, equity, fixed income or other 

investment alternatives. Those changes in 

allocation may be from higher fee investments to 

lower fee investments. For example, at Dec. 31, 

2012, using the S&P 500 Index as a proxy for the 

global equity markets, we estimate that a 100=

point change in the value of the S&P 500 Index 

spread evenly throughout the year, would impact 

fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings 

per common share by $0.03 to $0.05. 
ŠContinuing run-off of structured debt< 

securitizations could reduce our total annual< 

revenue if the structured debt markets do not< 

recover.< ŠUncertain and volatile capital markets, 

particularly declines, could reduce the value of 

our investments in equity and debt securities, 

including pension and other post-retirement plan 

assets. ŠOur ability to continue to operate certain 

commingled investment funds at a net asset value 

of $1.00 per unit and to allow unrestricted cash 

redemptions by investors in those commingled 

funds (or by investors in other funds managed by 

us which are invested in those commingled 

investment funds) may be adversely affected by 

depressed mark-to-market prices of the 

underlying portfolio securities held by such 

funds, or by material defaults on such securities 

or by the level of liquidity that could be achieved 

from the portfolio securities in such funds; and 

we may be faced with claims from investors and 

exposed to financial loss as a result of our 

operation of such funds. 
ŠLow interest rates may result in the voluntarily 

waiving of fees on certain money market mutual 

funds and related distribution fees by us and 

others in order to prevent clients’ yields on such 

funds from becoming uneconomic, which could 

have an adverse impact on our revenue and 

results of operations. 
ŠThe process we use to estimate our projected 

credit losses and to ascertain the fair value of 

securities held by us is subject to uncertainty in 

that it requires use of statistical models and 

difficult, subjective and complex judgments, 

including forecasts of economic conditions and 

how these conditions might impair the ability of 

our borrowers and others to meet their 

obligations. In uncertain and volatile capital 

markets, our ability to estimate our projected 

credit losses may be impaired, which could 

adversely affect our overall profitability and 

results of operations. 
Low or volatile interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our net interest revenue and cash flows are sensitive 

to interest rate changes and changes in valuations in 

the debt or equity markets over which we have no 

control. Our net interest revenue is the difference 

between the interest income earned on our interest-

earning assets, such as the loans we make and the 

securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and the 

interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing 

liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed money. We 

also earn net interest revenue on interest-free funds we 

hold. The global market crisis has triggered a series of cuts 
in interest rates. During the last three fiscal years, the 

Federal Open Market Committee has kept the target 

federal funds rate between 0% and 0.25%. In late 

2012, the Federal Reserve announced “QE3” and 

“QE4” programs to buy mortgaged backed securities 

and long-term U.S. Treasury securities. The Federal 

Reserve indicated that it would keep these measures in 

place and that it anticipated keeping the target federal 

funds rate between 0% and 0.25% until such time as 

certain criteria relating to unemployment and inflation 

are met. In July 2012, the Governing Council of the 

European Central Bank lowered the deposit facility 

rate to 0%. The low interest rate environment has 

compressed our net interest spread and reduced our 

spread-based revenues. It has also resulted in the 

voluntary waiving of fees on certain money market 

mutual funds and related distribution fees by us and 

others in order to prevent the yields on such funds 
80 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) from becoming uneconomic, which has an adverse 
impact on our revenue and results of operations. 
Changes in interest rates could affect the interest 
earned on assets differently than interest paid on 

liabilities. A rising interest rate environment may 

result in our earning a larger net interest spread. 

Conversely, a falling interest rate environment may 

result in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If 

we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate 

risk, it could have a material adverse effect on our 

profitability. Further rapid increases in interest rates 

could also trigger one or more of the following 

additional effects, which could impact our business, 

results of operations and financial condition: 
Š changes in net interest revenue depending on our 

balance sheet position at the time of change. See 

discussion under “Asset/liability management” in 

the MD&A – Results of Operations section in 

this Annual Report; 
Š an increased number of delinquencies, 

bankruptcies or defaults and more nonperforming 

assets and net charge-offs as a result of abrupt 

increases in interest rates; 
Š a decline in the value of our fixed-income 

investment portfolio as a result of increasing 

interest rates; and 
Š increased borrowing costs. 
A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and 

market risks we face is contained in the “Risk 

management” section in the MD&A – Results of 

Operations in this Annual Report. 
Continued market volatility may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to manage risk. The capital and credit markets continue to experience 
volatility and disruption. Under these conditions, our 

hedging and other risk management strategies may not 

be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they 

would be under less volatile market conditions. 

Further market volatility could produce downward 

pressure on our stock price and credit availability 

without regard to our underlying financial strength. 

The broad decline in stock prices throughout the 

financial services industry since 2008, which has 

affected our common stock, could require us to 

perform further goodwill impairment testing. While a 

substantial goodwill impairment charge would not 

have a significant impact on our financial condition, it 

would have an adverse impact on our results of 

operations. For a discussion of goodwill, see “Critical 
accounting estimates – Goodwill and other 

intangibles” in the MD&A – Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report. In addition, severe 

market events have historically been difficult to 

predict and we could realize significant losses if 

unprecedented extreme market events were to reoccur. 

If markets experience further upheavals, there can be 

no assurance that we will not experience an adverse 

effect, which may be material, on our ability to 

manage risk and on our business, financial condition 

and results of operations. For a discussion of our 

management of market risk, see “Risk management-

Market risk” in the MD&A – Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report. 
We may experience further write-downs of financial instruments that we own and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions, reducing our earnings. 
We maintain an investment securities portfolio of 
various holdings, types and maturities. These 

securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale 

and, consequently, are recorded on our balance sheet 

at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported 

as a component of accumulated other comprehensive 

income, net of tax. Our portfolio includes U.S. 

Agency RMBS, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, 

sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed debt, non-agency 

U.S. and non-U.S. residential mortgage-backed 
securities, European floating rate notes, commercial 

mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, 

foreign covered bonds, corporate bonds, collateralized 

loan obligations, consumer asset backed securities and 

other securities, the values of which are subject to 

market price volatility to the extent unhedged. This 

volatility affects the amount of our capital. In 

addition, if such investments suffer credit losses, as 

we experienced with some of our investments in 2009, 

we may recognize in earnings the credit losses as an 

other-than-temporary impairment which could impact 

our revenue in the quarter in which we recognize the 

losses. For example, net securities losses totaled $4.8 

billion in the third quarter of 2009, primarily as a 

result of a charge related to restructuring the 

investment securities portfolio, which resulted in 

negative earnings per share that quarter. The losses in 

2009 reflected both credit-and non-credit-related 

losses on our investment securities portfolio. We 

could experience losses related to our investment 

securities portfolio in the future, which could 

ultimately adversely affect our results of operations 

and capital levels. For information regarding our 

investment securities portfolio, refer to “Consolidated 

balance sheet review – Investment securities” and for 
BNY Mellon 81 
Risk Factors (continued) information regarding the sensitivity of and risks 
associated with the market value of portfolio 

investments and interest rates, refer to the “Risk 

management – Market risk” sections both of which 

are in the MD&A – Results of Operations section in 

this Annual Report and Note 5 of the Notes to the 

Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. We are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by a slowing in capital market activity, weak financial markets or negative trends in savings rates or in individual investment preferences. Our principal operational focus is on fee-based 
business, which is distinct from commercial banking 

institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans 

and other traditional interest-generating products and 

services. Our fee-based businesses include investment 

management, custody, corporate trust, depositary 

receipts, clearing, collateral management and treasury 

services. Fees for many of our products and services are based 
on the volume of transactions processed, the market 

value of assets managed and administered, securities 

lending volume and spreads, and fees for other 

services rendered. Corporate actions, cross-border 

investing, global mergers and acquisitions activity, 

new debt and equity issuances, and secondary trading 

volumes all affect the level of our revenues. If the 

volumes of these activities decrease, our revenues will 

also decrease, which would negatively impact our 

results of operations. 
Asset-based fees are typically determined on a sliding 
scale so that, as the value of a client portfolio grows, 

we receive a smaller percentage of the increasing 

value as fee income. This is particularly important to 

our asset management, global funds services and 

global custody businesses. In addition, weak financial 

markets could result in reduced market values in some 

of the assets that we manage and administer and result 

in a corresponding decrease in the amount of fees we 

receive and therefore would have an adverse effect on 

our results of operations. Similarly, significant 

declines in the volume of capital markets activity 

would reduce the number of transactions we process 

and the amount of securities lending we do and 

therefore would also have an adverse effect on our 

results of operations. 
Our business generally benefits when individuals 

invest their savings in mutual funds and other 

collective funds, in defined benefit plans, unit 

investment trusts or exchange traded funds. If there is 

a decline in the savings rates of individuals, or if there 

is a change in investment preferences that leads to less 

investment in mutual funds, other collective funds, 

defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans, 

our revenues could be adversely affected. 
Our foreign exchange revenues may continue to be adversely affected by a stable exchange-rate environment or decreased cross-border investing activity. 
The degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can 
affect the amount of our foreign exchange trading 

revenue. Most of our foreign exchange revenue is 

derived from our securities servicing client base. 

Activity levels and spreads are generally higher when 

there is more volatility. Accordingly, we benefit from 

currency volatility and our foreign exchange revenue 

is likely to decrease during times of decreased 

currency volatility. 
Continuing declines in foreign exchange volatility 
could continue to impact our foreign exchange 

revenue. In addition, our future revenue may increase 

or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or 

decreases in cross-border or other investments made 

by our clients. Economic and political uncertainties 

resulting from terrorist attacks, military actions or 

other events, including changes in laws or regulations 

governing cross-border transactions, such as currency 

controls, could result in decreased cross-border 

investment activity. 
Credit and Liquidity Risk Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our debt and trust preferred securities and the debt 
and deposits of our subsidiaries, The Bank of New 
York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., are currently 
rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. 
These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our 
rated subsidiaries and their outlook on us and our 
rated subsidiaries. Their credit ratings are based on a 
number of factors, including our financial strength, as 

well as factors not entirely within our control, 
82 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) including conditions affecting the financial services 
industry generally as well as the U.S. Government. In 

addition, rating agencies employ different models and 

formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated 

company, and from time to time rating agencies have, 

in their discretion, altered these models. Changes to 

rating agency models, general economic conditions, or 

other circumstances outside of our control could 

impact a rating agency’s judgment of the rating or 

outlook it assigns us or our rated subsidiaries. In view 

of the difficulties experienced in recent years by many 

financial institutions, we believe that the rating 

agencies have heightened their level of scrutiny, 

increased the frequency and scope of their credit 

reviews, have requested additional information, and 

have adjusted upward the capital and other 

requirements employed in their models for 

maintenance of rating levels. For example, in March 

2012, Moody’s downgraded our long-term senior and 

subordinated debt and trust-preferred securities ratings 

as well as the long-term debt and deposit ratings of 

our bank subsidiaries by one notch. 
Moreover, Moody’s has indicated that regulatory 
changes in the Dodd-Frank Act could result in lower 

debt and deposit ratings for U.S. banks and other 

financial institutions, including us, whose ratings 

currently benefit from assumed government support. 

Currently, our ratings benefit from one notch of “lift” 

and The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, 

N.A. benefit from two notches of “lift” as a result of 
the rating agency’s government support assumptions. 

Moody’s continues to evaluate whether to reduce its 

support assumptions to below pre-financial crisis 

levels for banks that currently benefit from ratings 

uplift. There can be no assurance that we or our rated 

subsidiaries will maintain our respective credit ratings 

or outlook on our securities. 
A material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit 
ratings of our rated subsidiaries could have a material 

adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the 

related cost of funding and borrowing, our credit 

spreads, our liquidity and on certain trading revenues, 

particularly in those businesses where counterparty 

creditworthiness is critical. Our credit spreads, which 

is the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. 

Treasury securities (or other benchmark securities) of 

the same maturity that we need to pay our debt 

investors, may be impacted by our credit ratings and 

market perceptions of our creditworthiness. In 

addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter 

derivatives contracts and other trading agreements, 

counterparties may require us to provide additional 

collateral or to terminate these contracts and 
agreements and collateral financing arrangements in 

the event of a material credit ratings downgrade below 

certain ratings levels. Termination of these contracts 

and agreements could impair our liquidity by 

requiring us to find other sources of financing or to 

make significant cash payments or securities 

movements. An increase in the costs of our funding 

and borrowing, or an impairment of our liquidity, 

could have a material adverse effect on our results of 

operations and financial condition. We cannot predict 

what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions 

we may be required to take in response to the actions 

of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us. For 

further discussion on the impact of a credit rating 

downgrade, see Note 24 of the Notes to the 

Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties, many of whom are major financial institutions, and our assumption of credit and counterparty risk, could expose us to loss and adversely affect our business. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions 
could be adversely affected by the actions and 

commercial soundness of other financial institutions. 

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a 

result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other 

relationships. We have exposure to many different 

industries and counterparties, particularly with other 

financial institutions, and we routinely execute 

transactions with counterparties in the financial 

industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial 

banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and 

other institutional clients. As a result, defaults or non=

performance by, or even rumors or questions about, 

one or more financial services institutions, or the 

financial services industry generally, have in the past 

led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead 

to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in 

the future. For example, as a result of our membership 

in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges, 

we may be required to guarantee obligations and 

liabilities or provide financial support in the event that 

other members do not honor their obligations or 

default. These obligations may be limited to members 

who dealt with the defaulting member or to the 

amount (or a multiple of the amount) of our 

contribution to a member’s guarantee fund, or, in a 

few cases, the obligation may be unlimited. The 

consolidation of financial service firms and the 

failures of other financial institutions have increased 

the concentration of our counterparty risk. 
BNY Mellon 83 
Risk Factors (continued) The degree of client demand for short-term credit also 
tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, 

exposing us to further counterparty-related risks. For 

example, investors in collective investment vehicles 

for which we act as custodian may engage in 

significant redemption activity due to adverse market 

or economic news that was not anticipated by the 

fund’s manager. Our relationship with our clients, the 

nature of the settlement process and our systems may 

result in our extension of short-term credit in such 

circumstances. For some types of clients, we provide 

credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which 

may expose us to potential loss if the client 

experiences credit difficulties. In addition to our 

exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to 

time exposed to concentrated credit risk at the 

industry or country level, potentially exposing us to a 

single market or political event or a correlated set of 

events. As a consequence, we may incur a loss in 

relation to one entity or product even though our 

exposure to one of its affiliates or across product types 

is over-collateralized. Moreover, not all of our 

counterparty exposure is secured and, when our 

exposure is secured, the realizable market value of the 

collateral may have declined by the time we exercise 

rights against that collateral. This risk may be 

particularly acute if we are required to sell the 

collateral into an illiquid or temporarily impaired 

market. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to 

the valuation of collateral significantly increase in 

times of market stress and illiquidity. 
We act as agent for securities lending arrangements 
between customers and financial counterparties, 

including broker-dealers, wherein securities are 

sourced from our customers versus cash or securities 

posted by such financial counterparties. We invest the 

proceeds from such securities lending transactions 

pursuant to certain instructions or guidelines from 

customers. In certain cases, we agree to indemnify our 

customers against defaults on the securities lending 

agreements and may have to buy-in the securities with 

the cash collateral or the proceeds from the liquidation 

of the collateral. In those instances, we, rather than 

our customers, are exposed to the risks of the 

defaulting counterparty on the securities lending 

transaction. Although our overall business is subject to these 
interdependencies, several of our business units are 

particularly sensitive to them, including our currency 

and other trading activities, our securities lending and 

tri-party repo businesses and our investment 

management business. There is no assurance that any 

such losses would not materially and adversely affect 

our results of operations. 
We have credit, regulatory and reputation risks as a result of our tri-party repo agent services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. BNY Mellon offers tri-party agent services to dealers 
and cash investors active in the tri-party repurchase, 

or repo, market. BNY Mellon currently has 

approximately 80% of the market share of the U.S. tri=

party repo market. As a tri-party repo agent, we 

facilitate settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) 

and investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and a cash 

investor agree to a tri-party repo trade and send 

instructions to us. We maintain custody of the 

collateral (the subject securities of the repo) and 

execute the payment and delivery instructions agreed 

to and provided by the principals. 
Providing these tri-party repo agent services to dealers 
and cash investors involves credit risk at certain points 

in time. To facilitate the tri-party repo market, we 

extend secured intraday credit to dealers. In the event 

of a default by a dealer to whom we have extended 

secured intraday credit, we would be at risk for the 

market value of the collateral securing such intraday 

credit, and to the defaulting dealer for any shortfall 

after the liquidation of such collateral, which could 

adversely affect our results of operations. Once a tri=

party trade settles, however, BNY Mellon is no longer 

exposed to that dealer default risk. 
BNY Mellon is working to reduce significantly the 
risk associated with the secured intraday credit we 

provide with respect to the tri-party repo market. We 

have implemented several measures in that regard, 

including: reducing the amount of time we extend 

intraday credit, implementing three-way trade 

confirmations, and automating the way dealers can 

substitute collateral in their tri-party repo trades. 

Additionally in 2013, we have limited the eligibility 

for intraday credit associated with tri-party repo 

transactions to certain more liquid asset classes that 

will result in a reduction of exposures secured by less 

liquid forms of collateral by dealers. These efforts are 

consistent with the recommendations by the Tri-Party 

Repo Infrastructure Reform Task Force that was 

sponsored by the Payments Risk Committee of the 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York and included 

representatives from a diverse group of market 

participants, including BNY Mellon. 
We anticipate that the combination of these measures 
will have reduced risks substantially in our tri-party 

repo activity in the near term and, together with 
84 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) technology enhancements currently in development 
will achieve the practical elimination of intraday 

credit in this activity, by the end of 2014. We believe 

the steps we are taking are responsive to recent 

concerns voiced publicly by regulators that dealers 

and investors should reduce reliance on intraday credit 

provided by their tri-party repo agents and make risk 

management practices more resilient to a stress event 

in the tri-party repo market. We anticipate that 

regulators will continue to monitor the actions of 

market participants and use available supervisory 

tools to encourage constructive and timely action to 

reduce sources of risk in the tri-party market. Failure 

to meet regulatory expectations could result in 

regulatory and reputation risk and additional costs. 
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity. Our business is dependent in part on our ability to 
meet our cash and collateral obligations at a 

reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected 

cash flows. We rely on our client deposits as a low-

cost and stable source of funding. If we lost a 

significant amount of deposits (because, for example, 

we received a material downgrade in our credit 

ratings) we may need to replace such funding with 

more expensive funding and/or reduce assets, which 

would reduce our net interest revenue. In addition, the 

Parent’s access to both short-term money markets and 

long-term capital markets are significant sources of 

liquidity. Events or circumstances often outside of our 

control, such as market disruptions or loss of 

confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties in us 

or in the funds markets, could limit our access to 

capital markets, increase our cost of borrowing, 

adversely affect our liquidity, or impair our ability to 

execute our business plan. In addition, our ability to 

raise funding could be impaired if investors develop a 

negative perception of our financial prospects. Such 

negative perceptions could be developed if we suffer a 

significant decline in the level of our business activity, 

we are materially downgraded, regulatory authorities 

take significant action against us, or we discover 

significant employee misconduct or illegal activity, 

among other reasons. If we are unable to raise funding 

using the methods described above, we would likely 

need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets, 

such as our investment portfolio, to meet funding 

needs. We may be unable to sell some of our assets, or 

we may have to sell assets at a discount from market 

value, either of which could adversely affect our 

financial condition and results of operations. 

Additionally, if we experience cash flow mismatches, 
market constraints from our inability to convert assets 

to cash or raise cash in the markets or deposit run-off, 

our liquidity could be severely impacted. For a further 

discussion of our liquidity, see “Liquidity and 

dividends” in the MD&A – Results of Operations 

section in this Annual Report. 
We could incur income statement charges through provision expense if our reserves for credit losses, including loan reserves, are inadequate. When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter 
into a letter of credit or other contract with a 

counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses 

if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our 

counterparties fail to perform according to the terms 

of their agreements. Our credit exposure is comprised 

of six classes of financing receivables: financial 

institutions, commercial, commercial real estate, lease 

financings, wealth management loans and mortgages, 

and other residential mortgages. Though credit risk is 

inherent in lending activities, our revenues and 

profitability are adversely affected when our 

borrowers default in whole or in part on their loan 

obligations to us or when there is a significant change 

in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We reserve 

for credit losses by establishing an allowance through 

a charge to earnings. The allowance for loan losses 

and allowance for lending related commitments 

represents management’s estimate of probable losses 

inherent in our credit portfolio. We utilize a 

quantitative methodology, which is supplemented 

with a qualitative framework that takes into account 

internal and external environmental factors that are 

not captured within the quantitative methodology. The 

quantitative methodology and qualitative framework 

determine the allowance for credit losses. We cannot 

provide any assurance as to whether charge-offs 

related to our credit exposure may occur in the future. 

Current market and economic developments may 

increase default and delinquency rates and negatively 

impact the quality of our credit portfolio, which may 

impact our charge-offs. If the allowance for credit 

losses is inadequate due to deterioration in the credit 

quality of the portfolio or significant charge-offs, we 

would be required to record credit loss provisions 

against current earnings, which could adversely 

impact our net income. 
BNY Mellon 85 
Risk Factors (continued) Other Risk Tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income, effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition. In the course of our business, we receive inquiries and 
challenges from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax 

authorities on the amount of taxes we owe. If we are 

not successful in defending these inquiries and 

challenges, we may be required to adjust the timing or 

amount of taxable income or deductions or the 

allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of 

which can require a greater provision for taxes or 

otherwise negatively affect earnings. Probabilities and 

outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and 

adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary, 

but the reserves may prove inadequate because we 

cannot necessarily accurately predict the outcome of 

any challenge, settlement or litigation or to what 

extent it will negatively affect us or our business. In 

addition, changes in tax laws or the interpretation of 

existing tax laws worldwide could have a material 

impact on our net income. See Notes 13 and 23 to 

Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report for further information. 
Changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements. From time to time, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board, the International Accounting 

Standards Board, the SEC and bank regulators change 

the financial accounting and reporting standards 

governing the preparation of our financial statements 

such as the potential adoption of International 

Financial Reporting Standards. In some cases, we 

could be required to apply a new or revised standard 

retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period 

financial statements. See “Recent Accounting 

Developments” in the MD&A section and Note 2 to 

Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual 

Report. These changes are difficult to predict and can 

materially impact how we record and report our 

financial condition and results of operations and other 

financial data. 
We are a non-operating holding
 company, and as a result, are dependent on dividends from
 our subsidiaries, including
 our subsidiary
 banks, to
 meet
 our obligations, including
 our obligations with respect to our securities,
 and to
 provide funds for
 payment of dividends to
 our stockholders and stock
 repurchases. We are a non-operating holding company, whose 
principal assets and sources of income are our 
principal bank subsidiaries – The Bank of New York 

Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A. – and our other 

subsidiaries. We are a legal entity separate and 

distinct from our banks and other subsidiaries and, 

therefore, we rely primarily on dividends and interest 

from these banking and other subsidiaries to meet our 

obligations, including our obligations with respect to 

our securities, and to provide funds for payment of 

common and preferred dividends to our stockholders, 

to the extent declared by our Board of Directors. 
There are various legal limitations on the extent to 
which these banking and other subsidiaries can 

finance or otherwise supply funds to us (by dividend 

or otherwise) and certain of our affiliates. Many of our 

subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, are 

subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or 

authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the 

flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent 

company or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank 

subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability 

to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum 

regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well 

as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited 

with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their 

businesses. Although we maintain cash positions for liquidity at 
the holding company level, if our principal banking 

subsidiaries or other subsidiaries were unable to 

supply us with cash over time, we could be unable to 

meet our obligations, including our obligations with 

respect to our securities, declare or pay dividends in 

respect of our capital stock, or perform stock 

repurchases. See “Supervision and Regulation”, the 

“Liquidity and Dividends” section in the MD&A – 

Results of Operations section and Note 20 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this 

Annual Report. 
Because we are a holding company, our rights and the 
rights of our creditors, including the holders of our 

securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary 

upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the 

subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of the 

subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of our 

banking subsidiaries, their depositors) except to the 

extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with 

recognized claims against the subsidiary. The rights of 

holders of our securities to benefit from those 

distributions will also be junior to those prior claims. 

Consequently, our securities will be effectively 

subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our 

subsidiaries. 86 BNY Mellon 
Risk Factors (continued) Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by the Federal Reserve, applicable provisions of Delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to 
receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may 

declare out of funds legally available for such 

payments. Although we have historically declared 

cash dividends on our common stock, we are not 

required to do so. In addition, any increase in BNY 

Mellon’s ongoing quarterly dividend would require 

approval from the Federal Reserve. A failure to 

increase dividends along with our competitors, or any 

reduction of, or elimination of, our common stock 

dividend would likely adversely affect the market 

price of our common stock and market perceptions of 

BNY Mellon. 
Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or 
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our 

common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to 

the preferred stock as to the payment of dividends 

and/or the distribution of any assets on any 

liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of BNY Mellon 

will be prohibited, subject to certain restrictions, in the 
event that we do not declare and pay in full preferred 

dividends for the then current dividend period of our 

Series A preferred stock or the last preceding dividend 

period of our Series C preferred stock. 
Anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Provisions of Delaware law and provisions of our 
certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it 

more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 

or have the effect of discouraging a third party from 

attempting to acquire control of us. Additionally, our 

certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of 

Directors to issue additional series of preferred stock 

and such preferred stock could be issued as a 

defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. 

These provisions could make it more difficult for a 

third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might 

be in the best interest of our stockholders. These 

provisions could also potentially deprive stockholders 

of an opportunity to sell their shares of common stock 

at a premium over prevailing market prices as a result 

of a takeover bid or merger. 
BNY Mellon 87 
Supervision and RegulationEvolving Regulatory Environment BNY Mellon, together with its subsidiaries, engages 
in banking, investment advisory and other financial 

activities in the U.S. and 35 other countries, and is 

subject to extensive regulation. Global supervisory 

authorities generally are charged with ensuring the 

safety and soundness of financial institutions, 

protecting the interests of customers, including 

depositors in banking entities and investors in mutual 

funds and other pooled vehicles, and safeguarding the 

integrity of securities and other financial markets and 

promoting systemic resiliency and financial stability 

in the relevant country. They are not, however, 

generally charged with protecting the interests of our 

stockholders or non-deposit creditors. This discussion 

outlines the material elements of selected laws and 

regulations applicable to us. Changes in these 

standards, or in their application, cannot be predicted, 

but may have a material effect on our businesses and 

results of operations. 
The financial services industry has been the subject of 
enhanced regulatory scrutiny in recent years and we 

expect this trend to continue in the future. Our 

business has been subject to myriad new global 

reform measures. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, 

when fully implemented, will significantly restructure 

the financial regulatory regime in the United States 

and enhance supervision and prudential standards for 

BHCs like BNY Mellon. The implications of the 

Dodd-Frank Act for our businesses will depend to a 

large extent on the manner in which forthcoming rules 

are implemented by the primary U.S. financial 

regulatory agencies – the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, 

the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the 

“OCC”), the SEC and the Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). The implications 

will also depend upon changes in market practices and 

structures in response to the requirements of the 

Dodd-Frank Act and financial reforms in other 

jurisdictions. Many aspects of Dodd-Frank remain 

subject to further rulemaking, take effect over various 

transition periods, or contain other elements that make 

it difficult to precisely anticipate their final impact. 

Dodd-Frank contains many major domestic reforms 

that will eventually be applicable to BNY Mellon; 

however, there are additional national and global 

reform measures being considered by various 

policymakers that may materially impact us, including 

the U.S. implementation of the Basel III accord and 

several more general non-U.S. regulatory initiatives. 

Relevant regulatory initiatives, whether national or 

global, are discussed further below. 
Enhanced Prudential Standards Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act direct 

the Federal Reserve to enact heightened prudential 

standards applicable to financial institutions with total 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more (generally 

referred to as “systemically important financial 

institutions” or “SIFIs”), such as BNY Mellon. Dodd-

Frank mandates that the requirements applicable to 

systemically important financial institutions be more 

stringent than those applicable to other financial 

companies. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve 

issued for public comment a notice of proposed 

rulemaking, which we refer to as the “Proposed SIFI 

Rules,” establishing enhanced prudential standards 

for: Š risk-based capital requirements and leverage 

limits; Š stress testing of capital; 
Š liquidity requirements; 
Š overall risk management requirements; and 
Š single-counterparty credit exposure limits. 
Only the rules addressing the stress testing of capital 

have been finalized and the ultimate impacts of the 

other proposals remain uncertain. The Proposed SIFI 

Rules also include draft requirements to address 

Dodd-Frank’s early remediation provisions. Those 

rules, as released, would require institutions to take 

remedial actions during the early stages of a 

company’s financial distress, if specified trigger 

events occur. 
Capital Planning Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other 
Capital Distributions 
The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from 
its bank subsidiaries and other subsidiaries. Dividends 

and interest from its subsidiaries are its principal 

sources of funds to make capital contributions or loans 

to its subsidiaries, to service its own debt, to honor its 

guarantees of debt issued by its subsidiaries or of trust 

preferred securities issued by a trust or to make its 

own capital distributions. Various federal and state 

statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends 

that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries 

without regulatory consent. If, in the opinion of the 

applicable federal regulatory agency, a depository 

institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is 

about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice 

(which, depending on the financial condition of the 

bank, could include the payment of dividends), the 
88 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) regulator may require, after notice and hearing, that 
the bank cease and desist from such practice. The 

OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have 

indicated that the payment of dividends would 

constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the 

payment would reduce a depository institution’s 

capital to an inadequate level. Moreover, under the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDI 

Act”), an insured depository institution may not pay 

any dividends if the institution is undercapitalized or 

if the payment of the dividend would cause the 

institution to become undercapitalized. In addition, the 

federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy 

statements which provide that FDIC-insured 

depository institutions and their holding companies 

should generally pay dividends only out of their 

current operating earnings. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid 
by The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, 

N.A., The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 

National Association and BNY Mellon Trust 

Company of Delaware is limited to the lesser of the 

amounts calculated under a “recent earnings” test and 

an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings 

test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all 

dividends declared and paid by the entity in any 

calendar year exceeds the current year’s net income 

combined with the retained net income of the two 

preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior 

regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, 

a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s 

“undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net 

profits that have not been paid out as dividends or 

transferred to surplus). The ability of it’s bank 

subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent may also 

be affected by various minimum capital requirements 

for banking organizations. 
BNY Mellon’s capital distributions are subject to 
Federal Reserve oversight. The major component of 

that oversight is the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive 

Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). The Federal 

Reserve’s capital planning rules also include new 

Dodd-Frank stress testing requirements, which were 

included in the Proposed SIFI Rules and adopted in 

final form in October 2012. The CCAR and stress 

testing requirements substantially overlap, and the 

Federal Reserve implements them at the BHC level on 

a coordinated basis. 
The rules require certain BHCs (including BNY 
Mellon) to submit annual capital plans to their 

respective Federal Reserve Bank. We are also 

required to collect and report certain related data on a 
quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve to 

monitor progress against the annual capital plans. 

BNY Mellon and other affected BHCs may pay 

dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital 

distributions only in accordance with a capital plan 

that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as 

to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The 

Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the 

plan does not show that the covered BHC will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio 

of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted 

assets of at least 5% on a 
pro forma 
basis under 
expected and stressful conditions throughout the nine-

quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. 

The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered 

BHC may not make a capital distribution unless after 

giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio 

of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted 

assets of at least 5%. As part of this process, BNY 

Mellon also provides the Federal Reserve with 

estimates of the composition and levels of regulatory 

capital, risk-weighted assets and other measures under 

Basel III under an identified scenario. We submitted 

our 2013 capital plan to the Federal Reserve on Jan. 7, 

2013. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it 

expects to publish either its objection or non-objection 

to the capital plan and proposed capital actions, such 

as dividend payments and share repurchases, no later 

than March 14, 2013. We anticipate announcing our 

2013 capital plan shortly thereafter. 
The purpose of CCAR is to ensure that these BHCs 
have robust, forward-looking capital planning 

processes that account for their unique risks and that 

permit continued operations during times of economic 

and financial stress. The CCAR rule, consistent with 

prior Federal Reserve Board guidance, provides that 

capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios 

exceeding 30% of projected after-tax net income will 

receive particularly close scrutiny. BNY Mellon’s 

common stock dividend payout ratio was 26% in 

2012. Regulatory Stress-Testing Requirements 

In October 2012, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC 
finalized regulations implementing the stress testing 

requirements required under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Under these regulations, we are required to undergo 

regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal 

Reserve annually, and to conduct our own internal 

stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements twice 

annually. In addition, both BNY Mellon, N.A. and 

The Bank of New York Mellon are required to 
BNY Mellon 89 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) conduct their own annual internal stress tests 
(although these banks are permitted to combine 

certain reporting and disclosure of their stress test 

results with the results of BNY Mellon). These 

requirements, which began in the fourth quarter of 

2012, involve both company-run and supervisory-run 

testing of capital under various scenarios, including 

baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios 

provided by the appropriate banking regulator. Results 

from our annual company-run stress tests will be 

reported to the appropriate regulators and we will be 

required to publish summaries of the results of the 

company-run stress tests under the severely adverse 

scenario beginning in March 2013. In addition, the 

Federal Reserve will publish summaries of the results 

of the Federal Reserve-run stress tests under the 

severely adverse scenario beginning in March 2013. 
Capital Requirements – Basel III Accord and Existing U.S. Requirements As a BHC, we are subject to consolidated regulatory 
capital rules administered by the Federal Reserve. Our 

bank subsidiaries are subject to similar capital 

requirements, administered by the Federal Reserve in 

the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the 

OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries, 

BNY Mellon, N.A. and The Bank of New York 

Mellon Trust Company, National Association. These 

requirements are intended to ensure that banking 

organizations have adequate capital given the risk 

levels of their assets and off-balance sheet financial 

instruments. Since the late 1980s, the U.S. banking agencies’ 
capital rules have been based on accords agreed to by 

the Basel Committee. These frameworks include: 
ŠRisk-based capital guidelines applicable to all 

BHCs and banks based on the Basel I agreement. 

The banking agencies refer to these rules as the 

“general risk-based capital rules”. 
ŠRisk-based capital rules applicable to BHCs 

(including BNY Mellon) and banks having $250 

billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 

billion or more in foreign exposures, based upon 

the advanced internal ratings-based approach for 

credit risk and the advanced measurement 

approach for operational risk within the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision’s 

comprehensive June 2006 release entitled 

“International Convergence of Capital 

Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised 

Framework”, known as “Basel II”. The agencies 

refer to these rules as the “Advanced Approaches 

risk-based capital rules”. 
In addition, the risk-based capital guidelines 

incorporate a measure for market risk in foreign 

exchange and commodity activities and in the trading 

of debt and equity instruments. The market risk-based 

capital guidelines require banking organizations with 

significant trading activities to maintain capital for 

market risk in an amount calculated by using the 

banking organizations’ own internal value-at-risk 

models, subject to parameters set by the regulators. In 

January 2011, certain of the federal banking agencies 

published proposed amendments to their market risk 

rules, implementing revisions to the Basel framework, 

commonly known as “Basel II.5”. In June 2012, 

federal banking agencies issued the final Market Risk 

rules that amend the Basel I Market Risk rules 

effective Jan. 1, 2013. 
In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its 
final framework for strengthening international capital 

and liquidity regulation in response to the financial 

crisis, now officially identified by the Basel 

Committee as “Basel III”. On June 7, 2012, the 

federal banking agencies issued three NPRs that 

would substantially revise the agencies’ existing 

capital rules (both general and advanced approaches). 

The NPRs would (i) implement Basel III for U.S. 

BHCs and banks (including by redefining the 

components of capital and establishing higher 

minimum percentages for applicable capital ratios) 

and (ii) substantially revise the agencies’ general risk-

based capital rules to make them more risk sensitive. 

Comments on the NPRs were due on Oct. 22, 2012. 

As proposed by the NPRs, the Basel III-based 

amendments would have become effective Jan. 1, 

2013, with phase-in periods that are consistent with 

Basel III. On Nov. 9, 2012, the agencies confirmed 

that the proposed rules would not become effective on 

Jan. 1, 2013, but without specifying the effectiveness 

date that would apply. If these rules when adopted 

preserve the Basel III implementation schedule, they 

are expected to be fully phased-in by Jan. 1, 2019. 

The NPRs provided that the risk-weightings in the 

new standardized approach, discussed below, would 

not become effective until Jan. 1, 2015. 
General Risk-Based Capital Rules 

Under the general risk-based capital rules, the risk-
based capital ratio is determined by dividing the sum 

of the capital components described further below, by 

risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance 

sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). The 

general risk-based capital rules provide that voting 

common stockholders’ equity should be the 

predominant element within Tier 1 capital and that 
90 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) banks should avoid over-reliance on non-common 
equity elements. Risk-adjusted assets are determined 

by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet 

items into weighted categories. The required 

minimum ratio of Total capital (the sum of Tier 1 and 

Tier 2 capital) to risk-adjusted assets is currently 

8.0%. The required minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to 

risk-adjusted assets is 4.0%. These rules are minimum 

standards based primarily on broad credit-risk 

considerations and do not take into account the other 

types of risk to which a banking organization may be 

exposed. The federal banking agencies retain 

significant discretion to set higher capital 

requirements for categories of banks, or for an 

individual bank as situations warrant. At Dec. 31, 

2012, BNY Mellon’s Basel I Tier 1 capital to risk-

adjusted assets and Total capital to risk-adjusted 

assets ratios were 15.0% and 16.3%, respectively. 
Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rules 

The U.S. banking agencies’ Advanced Approaches 
risk-based capital rules, which, as noted above are 

based on Basel II’s Advanced Approaches, became 

effective on April 1, 2008. Under these rules, 2009 

was the first year that a bank could begin its first of 

three transitional floor periods during which banks 

calculate their capital requirements under both the old 

regulations and new regulations. The rules originally 

provided that Advanced Approaches banks would 

calculate their capital requirements only under the 

new Basel II-based requirements after completion of a 

successful parallel run and the three transitional floor 

periods. In the U.S., we began the parallel run of 

calculations under both the old and new guidelines in 

the second quarter of 2010. Our capital models are 

currently with the Federal Reserve for their approval. 

In response to a Dodd-Frank requirement, the federal 

banking agencies have amended their capital rules to 

provide that minimum capital as required under the 

general risk-based capital rules will act as a floor for 

minimum capital requirements calculated in 

accordance with the advanced approaches rules. 

Accordingly, the three-year transition to calculations 

only under the Basel II-based requirements will be 

eliminated. The NPRs – Basel II and the New Standardized 
Approach The NPRs released by the U.S. banking agencies are 
generally consistent with the Basel III accord and 

would redefine the components of capital in the 

numerators of regulatory capital ratios in a more 

narrow way than existing standards, increase the 
minimum risk-based capital ratios under both the 

agencies’ advanced approaches and general risk-based 

capital guidelines, and primarily, with respect to 

securitizations and exposures to certain counterparties, 

change the measure of risk-weighted assets in the 

denominators of regulatory capital ratios. The NPRs, 

like Basel III, provide for a number of new deductions 

from and adjustments to Tier 1 common equity. These 

include, for example, providing that unrealized gains 

and losses on all available for sale debt securities 

would not be filtered out for regulatory capital 
purposes, and the requirement that mortgage servicing 

rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future 

taxable income, defined pension fund assets and 

significant investments in non-consolidated financial 

entities be deducted from Tier 1 common equity to the 

extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of Tier 

1 common equity or all such categories in the 

aggregate exceed 15% of Tier 1 common equity. At 

Dec. 31, 2012, we did not exceed either threshold. In 

addition, the NPRs would redefine regulatory capital 

elements resulting in, among other things, cumulative 

perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred 

instruments no longer qualifying as Tier 1 capital, 

subject to a phase-out schedule. 
The NPRs, consistent with Basel III require higher 
capital ratios for all banking institutions. As a result, 

when fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2019, banking 

institutions will be required to satisfy three risk-based 

capital ratios: 
Š A Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 7.0%, 

4.5% attributable to a minimum Tier 1 common 

equity ratio and 2.5% attributable to a “capital 

conservation buffer”; 
Š A Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, exclusive 

of the capital conservation buffer (8.5% upon full 

implementation of the capital conservation 

buffer); and 
Š A total capital ratio of at least 8.0%, exclusive of 

the capital conservation buffer (10.5% upon full 

implementation of the capital conservation 

buffer). All banking institutions will be subject to a minimum 

leverage ratio of 4.0% after giving effect to the NPRs 

(calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly 

average consolidated total assets as reflected on the 

institution’s consolidated financial statements, net of 

amounts deducted from capital). Additionally, the 

NPRs, consistent with Basel III, would subject 

Advanced Approaches banking institutions to a 

supplementary leverage ratio commencing Jan. 1, 

2015 with full implementation on Jan. 1, 2018. The 
BNY Mellon 91 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) new supplementary leverage ratio would be calculated 
as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average balance sheet 

exposures plus certain average off-balance sheet 

exposures. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb 
losses during periods of economic stress. Banking 

institutions with a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to 

risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below 

the conservation buffer (or below the combined 

capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital 

buffer, when the latter is applied) are expected to face 

constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and 

compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
The NPRs apply Basel III’s capital conservation 
buffer to all banking institutions, but apply its 

countercyclical capital buffer, when applicable, only 

to advanced approaches banks. The NPRs permit 

advanced approaches institutions, such as BNY 

Mellon, to calculate both the capital conservation 

buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer using 

solely Advanced Approaches risk-weightings, rather 

than applying a floor based on the general risk-based 

capital rules. 
In November 2011, the Basel Committee announced 
the final framework for applying a new Tier 1 

common equity surcharge to certain global 

systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), including 

BNY Mellon. In its Proposed SIFI Rules and the 

NPRs, the Federal Reserve indicated that it intends to 

propose, in a separate rulemaking, a Tier 1 common 

equity surcharge for G-SIBs based on the Basel 

Committee’s final rules. In November 2012, the Basel 

Committee and the Financial Stability Board updated 

the list of G-SIBs, and identified provisional Tier 1 

common equity surcharges applicable to each G-SIB, 

including BNY Mellon. Each G-SIB would initially 

be assigned to one of four “buckets”, with the capital 

surcharges for those buckets ranging from 1% to 

2.5%. In November 2012, BNY Mellon was 

provisionally assigned to the 1.5% capital surcharge 

bucket. At Dec. 31, 2012, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 
common equity ratio was 9.8%, on a fully phased-in 

basis, based on our understanding of the NPRs and the 

final market risk rules and calculated under the 

Advanced Approaches basis, as proposed to be 

amended by the NPRs. The increase in the ratio from 

7.1% at Dec. 31, 2011, which was calculated under 

prior Basel III guidance and the proposed market risk 

rule, was primarily due to a reduction in risk-weighted 

assets related to the treatment of sub-investment grade 
securities under the NPRs, earnings retention and an 

increase in the value of the investment portfolio, 

partially offset by balance sheet growth in 2012. We 

expect the approximately $850 million charge related 

to the Feb. 11, 2013 U.S. Tax Court ruling will 

decrease the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio by 

approximately 55 basis points. We believe that our 

fee-based model enables us to maintain a relatively 

low risk asset mix, primarily composed of high-

quality securities, central bank deposits, liquid 

placements and predominantly investment grade 

loans. The components of the NPRs related to the 
standardized approach would amend the agencies’ 

Basel I risk-based capital guidelines and replace the 

risk-weighting categories currently used to calculate 

risk-weighted assets in the denominator of capital 

ratios with a broader array of risk weighting 

categories that are intended to be more risk sensitive. 

The new risk-weights for the standardized approach 

range from 0% to 600% compared with the risk-

weights of 0% to 100%, in general, in the agencies’ 

existing Basel I risk-based capital guidelines. Higher 

risk-weights would apply to a variety of exposures, 

including certain securitization exposures, equity 

exposures, claims on securities firms and exposures to 

counterparties on OTC derivatives. Compared with 

Basel I, the risk-weighting changes likely to have 

significance for BNY Mellon are the replacement of 

the 20% risk-weight for banks with OECD country 

risk classification ratings, increased risk-weights for 

residential mortgages, the removal of the 50% risk-

weight cap on derivative transactions, the 100% risk-

weight for exposures to securities firms, and the 

elimination of the 0% risk-weight for commitments of 

less than one year. In addition, advanced approaches 

banking organizations will calculate risk-based capital 

ratios under both the generally applicable standardized 

approach and the advanced approaches rule, and then 

use the lower of each capital ratio to determine 

whether it meets its minimum risk-based capital 

requirements. Liquidity Ratios under Basel III Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and 
BHC liquidity have been addressed as a supervisory 

matter, both in the U.S. and internationally, without 

required formulaic measures. The Basel III final 

framework requires banks and BHCs to measure their 

liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although 

similar in some respects to liquidity measures 

historically applied by banks and regulators for 

management and supervisory purposes, going forward 

will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as 
92 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”), is designed to 
ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate 

level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal 

to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day 

time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total 

cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. 

The other, referred to as the net stable funding ratio 

(“NSFR”), is designed to promote more medium-and 

long-term funding of the assets and activities of 

banking entities over a one-year time horizon. The 

Basel III liquidity framework, as modified in January 

2013, contemplates that the LCR will be introduced 

Jan. 1, 2015 with the minimum requirement beginning 

at 60%, rising in equal annual steps of 10 percentage 

points to reach 100% on Jan. 1, 2019. Similarly, it 

contemplates that the NSFR will be subject to an 

observation period through mid-2016 and, subject to 

any revisions resulting from the analyses conducted 

and data collected during the observation period, 

implemented as a minimum standard by Jan. 1, 2018. 
The Proposed SIFI Rules address liquidity 
requirements for certain U.S. BHCs, including BNY 

Mellon. In the release accompanying those rules, the 

Federal Reserve states a general intention to 

incorporate the Basel III liquidity framework for the 

BHCs covered by the Proposed SIFI Rules or a 

“subset” of those BHCs. Although the Proposed SIFI 

Rules do not include prescriptive ratios like the LCR 

and NSFR, they do include detailed liquidity-related 

requirements, including requirements for cash flow 

projections, liquidity stress testing (including, at a 

minimum, over time horizons that include an 

overnight time horizon, a 30-day time horizon, a 90=

day time horizon and a one-year time horizon), and a 

requirement that covered BHCs maintain a liquidity 

buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets sufficient 

to meet projected net cash outflows and the projected 

loss or impairment of existing funding sources for 30 

days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios. 
Prompt Corrective Action The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 

(“FDICIA”), requires the federal banking agencies to 

take “prompt corrective action” in respect of 

depository institutions that do not meet specified 

capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital 

categories for FDIC-insured banks: “well capitalized”, 

“adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, 

“significantly undercapitalized” and “critically 

undercapitalized”. A depository institution is deemed 

to be “well capitalized” if the depository institution 

has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, 
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, 

and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and the 

institution is not subject to an order, written 

agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective 

action directive to meet and maintain a specific level 

for any capital measure. The FDI Act imposes 

progressively more restrictive constraints on 

operations, management and capital distributions, 

depending on the capital category in which an 

institution is classified. The U.S. banking agencies’ 

capital NPRs, discussed above under “Capital 

Requirements”, would amend the prompt corrective 

action requirements in certain respects, including 

adding the Basel III Tier 1 common equity risk-based 

capital ratio as one of the metrics (with a minimum of 

6.5% for “well capitalized” status), increasing the Tier 

1 risk-based capital ratio required at various levels 

(for example, from 6.0% to 8.0% for “well 

capitalized” status), and, for advanced approaches 

banks only, adding the Basel III-based supplementary 

leverage ratio at a minimum of 3% for “adequately 

capitalized” status. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, all of our bank subsidiaries were 
“well capitalized” based on the ratios and guidelines 

noted above. A bank’s capital category, however, is 

determined solely for the purpose of applying the 

prompt corrective action rules and may not be an 

accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial 

condition or prospects. 
Volcker Rule Dodd-Frank mandated that the U.S. banking agencies, 
the SEC and CFTC adopt rules that prohibit banks and 

their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading 

and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds 

and private equity funds. This provision is commonly 

called the Volcker Rule. While the Volcker Rule’s 

statutory provisions became effective on July 21, 

2012, the Federal Reserve issued interim guidance on 

April 19, 2012 that provided that banks and their 

affiliates must conform their covered activities and 

investments with the final Volcker Rule regulations 

by July 21, 2014. Banks and their affiliates are 

expected to engage in good-faith efforts that will 

result in conformance of all of their covered activities 

and investments by no later than the end of the 

conformance period. The Volcker Rule regulations 

have yet to be finalized and adopted. Regulators have 

proposed rules to implement the Volcker Rule, and 

until those rules are finalized, their application and 

impact will remain uncertain. BNY Mellon may be 

affected by an overly inclusive designation of covered 

funds, which could affect our ability to provide seed 
BNY Mellon 93 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) capital to launch new hedge funds, private equity 
funds and other covered funds. In addition, our ability 

to engage in certain transactions with covered funds 

(including, without limitation, certain U.S. funds for 

which BNY Mellon acts as both sponsor/manager and 

custodian) could be affected. This latter provision may 

also affect BNY Mellon’s ability to perform certain 

traditional custodial operational activities for these 

covered funds. 
Derivatives 
U.S. regulators are in the process of implementing 
comprehensive rules governing the supervision, 
structure, trading and regulation of cleared and over=

the-counter derivatives markets and participants. 

Dodd-Frank requires a large number of rulemakings 

in this area, many of which are not yet final. Once 

these rules are finalized, they could affect the way 

various BNY Mellon subsidiaries operate, and 

changes to the markets and participants will impact 

business models and profitability of certain BNY 

Mellon subsidiaries. 
Money Market Fund Reforms Authorities have also focused on risks that money 
market funds may pose to financial stability. In 

November 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council proposed several recommendations for 

money market mutual fund reform, which include 

requiring money market funds to use a floating net 

asset value, requiring them to maintain a capital buffer 

of up to 1% of a fund’s value coupled with a holdback 

of 3 to 5% on redemptions to create a “first loss” 

position and discourage runs, and requiring them to 

maintain a capital buffer of up to 3% of a fund’s value 

combined with other measures, such as investment 

diversification requirements, minimum liquidity 

levels, and/or more robust diversification 

requirements. It is premature to predict the outcome of 

these discussions and proposals, but regulatory 

changes to the money market fund industry could 

materially impact the operations and profitability of 

BNY Mellon. 
Tri-Party Repo Reform BNY Mellon offers tri-party agent services to dealers 
and cash investors active in the tri-party repurchase, 

or repo, market. As a tri-party repo agent, we facilitate 

settlement between dealers (cash borrowers) and 

investors (cash lenders). Our involvement in a 

transaction commences after a dealer and a cash 

investor agree to a tri-party repo trade and send 
instructions to us. We maintain custody of the 

collateral (the subject securities of the repo) and 

execute the payment and delivery instructions agreed 

to and provided by the principals. 
Regulatory agencies worldwide have begun to re=
examine systemic risks in various financial markets, 

including the tri-party repo market, in which we act as 

a tri-party repo agent. The Payment Risk Committee 

of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sponsored 

a Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure Reform 

to examine the risks in the tri-party repo market and to 

decide what changes should be implemented so that 

such risks may be mitigated or avoided in the future. 

The Task Force issued its recommendations on 

May 17, 2010 and its final report regarding the tri=

party repo market on Feb. 15, 2012. BNY Mellon is 

working to implement recommendations by the Task 

Force to significantly reduce the risk associated with 

the secured intraday credit we provide with respect to 

the tri-party repo market. BNY Mellon has 

implemented several measures in that regard, 

including reducing the amount of time we extend 

intraday credit, implementing three-way trade 

confirmations, and automating the way dealers can 

substitute collateral in their tri-party repo trades. 

Additionally, in 2013, we have limited the eligibility 

for intraday credit associated with tri-party repo 

transactions to certain more liquid asset classes that 

will result in a reduction of exposures secured by less 

liquid forms of collateral by dealers. We anticipate 

that the combination of these measures will have 

reduced risks substantially in our tri-party repo 

activity in the near term and, together with technology 

enhancements currently in development, will achieve 

the practical elimination of intraday credit in this 

activity by the end of 2014. 
Since May 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York has released monthly reports on the tri-party 

repo market, including information on aggregate 

volumes of collateral used in all tri-party repo 

transactions by asset class, concentrations, and margin 

levels, which is available at http:// 

www.newyorkfed.org/tripartyrepo/margin_data.html. Resolution Planning As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal 
Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a final rule requiring 

certain organizations, including each BHC with 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, to report 

periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid 

and orderly resolution in the event of material 

financial distress or failure. In addition, the FDIC 
94 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) issued a final rule that requires insured depository 
institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, 

such as The Bank of New York Mellon, to submit to 

the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of 

the institution’s failure. 
The two resolution plan rules are complementary and 
we submitted our initial resolution plan in conformity 

with both rules on Oct. 1, 2012. The public portions of 

our resolution plan are available on the FDIC’s 

website. We are required to submit updated resolution 

plans annually by July 1. Resolution planning efforts 

might also become required in foreign jurisdictions 

where we have operations, and we submitted the first 

phase of our UK resolution pack to the Financial 

Services Authority (“FSA”) in June of 2012. 
Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a Bank Holding Company If the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for 
an insured depository institution such as The Bank of 

New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., upon its 

insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the 

power: Š to transfer any of the depository institution’s 

assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a 

newly formed “bridge” bank without the 

approval of the depository institution’s creditors; 
Š to enforce the terms of the depository 

institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms 

without regard to any provisions triggered by the 

appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or 
Š to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to 

which the depository institution is a party, the 

performance of which is determined by the FDIC 

to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or 

repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC 

to promote the orderly administration of the 

depository institution. 
In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of 

domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for 

administrative expenses against an insured depository 

institution would be afforded a priority over other 

general unsecured claims against such an institution, 

including claims of debt holders of the institution, in 

the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an 

institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not 

the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt 

obligations of The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A., the debt holders would be treated 

differently from, and could receive, if anything, 

substantially less than, the depositors of the bank. 
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new resolution regime 

(known as the “orderly liquidation authority”) for 

systemically important non-bank financial companies, 

including BHCs and their affiliates. Under the orderly 

liquidation authority, the FDIC may be appointed as 

receiver for the systemically important institution, and 

its failed non-bank subsidiaries, for purposes of 

liquidating the entity if, among other conditions, it is 

determined at the time of the institution’s failure that 

it is in default or in danger of default and the failure 

poses a risk to the stability of the U.S. financial 

system. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver under the orderly 
liquidation authority, then the powers of the receiver, 

and the rights and obligations of creditors and other 

parties who have dealt with the institution, would be 

determined under the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, and 

not under the insolvency law that would otherwise 

apply. The powers of the receiver under the orderly 

liquidation authority were based on the powers of the 

FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the 

FDI Act. However, the provisions governing the 

rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation 

authority were modified in certain respects to reduce 

disparities with the treatment of creditors’ claims 

under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as compared to the 

treatment of those claims under the new authority. 

Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of 

creditors exist as between these two regimes, 

including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict 

priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the 

use of an administrative claims procedure to 

determine creditors’ claims (as opposed to the judicial 

procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the 

right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” 

entity. The orderly liquidation authority provisions of the 
Dodd-Frank Act became effective upon enactment. 

However, a number of rulemakings are required under 

the terms of Dodd-Frank, and a number of provisions 

of the new authority require clarification. The FDIC 

has completed its initial phase of rulemaking under 

the orderly liquidation authority, but additional rules 

are under consideration. These rules may affect the 

manner in which the new authority is applied, 

particularly with respect to broker-dealer and futures 

commission merchant subsidiaries of BHCs. 
Depositor Preference Under federal law, depositors and certain claims for 
administrative expenses and employee compensation 

against an insured depository institution are afforded a 
BNY Mellon 95 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such an institution, including federal funds and letters 

of credit, in the “liquidation or other resolution” of 

such an institution by any receiver. The FSA 

published a consultation paper in Sept. 2012 

concerning the implications of national depositor 

preference regimes of countries not within the 

European Economic Area (“EEA”) (including, among 

others, the U.S.) that prioritize the claims of home-

country depositors over those of depositors outside the 

home country if a deposit taking banking organization 

becomes insolvent. The proposed new FSA rules 

would prohibit firms, including BNY Mellon, from 

non-EEA countries that operate such regimes from 

accepting deposits through a UK branch, unless 

measures are introduced to eliminate the perceived 

disadvantage to UK depositors caused by the 

subordination of their claims in favor of home country 

depositors. The proposal would also require certain 

depositor notice undertakings. The FSA initially 

intended that these new standards would start to take 

effect by January 2013, with a full compliance 

deadline of January 2015, but the consultation period 

for its proposal was extended to Jan. 31, 2013. The 

FDIC recently initiated a related rulemaking to clarify 

the treatment of non-U.S. deposits in a bank resolution 

and for deposit insurance purposes. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders Transactions between BNY Mellon’s bank 
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and BNY Mellon and 

its non-bank subsidiaries, on the other, are regulated 

by the Federal Reserve. These regulations limit the 

types and amounts of transactions (including loans 

due and extensions of credit from the U.S. bank 

subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require 

those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. 

These regulations generally do not apply to 

transactions between a U.S. bank subsidiary and its 

subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require that 

any extensions of credit by a BNY Mellon bank 

subsidiary to BNY Mellon or to a BNY Mellon non-

bank subsidiary must be secured by designated 

amounts of specified collateral and are limited, as to 

any one of BNY Mellon or such non-bank affiliates, 

to 10% of the lending bank’s capital stock and 

surplus, and, as to BNY Mellon and all such non-bank 

affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of such lending 

bank’s capital stock and surplus. 
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the 
coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate 

transactions within a banking organization. For 

example, commencing in July 2012, the Dodd-Frank 
Act required that the 10% of capital limit on covered 

transactions apply to financial subsidiaries. 

Commencing in July 2012, Dodd-Frank also 

expanded the definition of a “covered transaction” to 

include derivatives transactions and securities lending 

transactions with a non-bank affiliate under which a 

bank (or its subsidiary) has credit exposure (with the 

term “credit exposure” to be defined by the Federal 

Reserve under its existing rulemaking authority). 

Collateral requirements will apply to such transactions 

as well as to certain repurchase and reverse repurchase 

agreements. Deposit Insurance Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of 
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., accept 

deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC 

insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit 

for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 

for each depositor account. For noninterest-bearing 

transaction accounts, temporary unlimited deposit 

insurance coverage ceased on January 1, 2013. Under 

the FDI Act, insurance of deposits may be terminated 

by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured 

depository institution has engaged in unsafe and 

unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound 

condition to continue operations or has violated any 

applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition 

imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. 
The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) is 
funded by assessments on insured depository 

institutions. The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based 

on a bank’s average consolidated total assets, less the 

average tangible equity of the insured depository 

institution during the assessment period. For larger 

institutions, such as The Bank of New York Mellon 

and BNY Mellon, N.A., assessments are determined 

based on CAMELS ratings and forward-looking 

financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, 

which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the 

assessment base. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FDIC to 
determine whether and to what extent adjustments to 

the assessment base are appropriate for custody banks. 

During 2011, the FDIC concluded that certain liquid 

assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance 

assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain 

institutional eligibility criteria. This has the effect of 

reducing the amount of DIF insurance premiums due 

from custody banks. The Bank of New York Mellon is 

a custody bank for this purpose. The custody bank 

assessment adjustment may not exceed total 
96 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) transaction account deposits identified by the 
institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or 

custody and safekeeping asset. 
Source of Strength and Liability of Affiliates Federal Reserve policy historically has required BHCs 
to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries 

and to commit capital and financial resources to 

support those subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act 

codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Such 

support may be required by the Federal Reserve at 

times when we might otherwise determine not to 

provide it. In addition, any loans by BNY Mellon to 

its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of 

payment to depositors and to certain other 

indebtedness of its banks. In the event of a BHC’s 

bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal 

bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary 

bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and 

entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, in certain 

circumstances BNY Mellon’s insured depository 

institutions could be assessed for losses incurred by 

another BNY Mellon insured depository institution. In 

the event of impairment of the capital stock of one of 

BNY Mellon’s national banks or The Bank of New 

York Mellon, BNY Mellon, as the banks’ stockholder, 

could be required to pay such deficiency. 
Incentive Compensation Arrangements Proposal The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to 
prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding 

incentive-based compensation practices at certain 

financial institutions. On April 14, 2011, federal 

regulators including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve 

and the SEC, issued a proposed rule which, among 

other things, would require certain executive officers 

of covered financial institutions with total 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as 

ours, to defer at least 50% of their annual incentive-

based compensation for a minimum of three years. 

The comment period on the proposed rule closed 

May 31, 2011. Final regulations have not been issued 

as of this date. 
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act A major focus of governmental policy on financial 
institutions has been aimed at combating money 

laundering and terrorist financing. The USA 

PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains numerous anti-money 

laundering requirements for financial institutions that 

are applicable to BNY Mellon’s bank, broker-dealer 

and investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds 
and private investment companies advised or 

sponsored by our subsidiaries. Those regulations 

impose obligations on financial institutions to 

maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls 

to detect, prevent and report money laundering and 

terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their 

customers. Certain of those regulations impose 

specific due diligence requirements on financial 

institutions that maintain correspondent or private 

banking relationships with non-U.S. financial 

institutions or persons. 
Privacy 
The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including 

BNY Mellon, from disclosing nonpublic personal 

financial information of consumer customers to third 

parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 

unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of 

the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts 

information sharing among affiliates for marketing 

purposes. Acquisitions 
Federal and state laws impose notice and approval 
requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving 

depository institutions or BHCs. The BHC Act 

requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for 

the direct or indirect acquisition by a BHC of more 

than 5% of any class of the voting shares or all or 

substantially all of the assets of a commercial bank, 

savings and loan association or BHC. In reviewing 

bank acquisition and merger applications, the bank 

regulatory authorities will consider, among other 

things, the competitive effect of the transaction, 

financial and managerial issues including the capital 

position of the combined organization, convenience 

and needs factors, including the applicant’s record 

under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 

which requires U.S. banks to help serve the credit 

needs of their communities (including credit to low 

and moderate income individuals and geographies) 

and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in 

combating money laundering activities. In addition, 

prior Federal Reserve approval would be required for 

certain large non-banking acquisitions and 

investments. Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements BNY Mellon is regulated as a BHC and a financial 
holding company (“FHC”) under the Bank Holding 
BNY Mellon 97 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) Company Act of 1956, as amended by the Gramm=
Leach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the 

“BHC Act”). We are subject to supervision by the 

Federal Reserve. In general, the BHC Act limits a 

BHC’s business activities to banking, managing or 

controlling banks, performing certain servicing 

activities for subsidiaries, engaging in activities 

incidental to banking, and engaging in any activity, or 

acquiring and retaining the shares of any company 

engaged in any activity, that is either financial in 

nature or complementary to a financial activity and 

does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and 

soundness of depository institutions or the financial 

system generally. 
A BHC’s ability to maintain FHC status is dependent 
upon a number of factors, including: 
Š its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries 

qualifying on an ongoing basis as “well 

capitalized” and “well managed” under the 

prompt corrective regulations of the appropriate 

regulatory agency (discussed above under 

“Prompt Corrective Action”); and 
Š the BHC itself, qualifying on an ongoing basis as 

“well capitalized” and “well managed” under 

applicable Federal Reserve regulations. 
An FHC that does not continue to meet all the 

requirements for FHC status will, depending on which 

requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to 

undertake new activities, or make acquisitions, that 

are not generally permissible for BHCs without FHC 

status or to continue such activities. 
The Bank of New York Mellon, which is BNY 
Mellon’s largest bank subsidiary, is a New York state 

chartered bank, a member of the Federal Reserve 

System and subject to regulation, supervision and 

examination by the Federal Reserve and the New 

York State Department of Financial Services. BNY 

Mellon’s national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, 

N.A. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust 
Company, National Association, are chartered as 

national banking associations subject to primary 

regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. 
We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in 
securities underwriting and other broker-dealer 

activities in the United States. These companies are 

SEC-registered broker-dealers and members of 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. 

(“FINRA”), a securities industry self-regulatory 

organization. BNY Mellon’s non-bank subsidiaries 

engaged in securities-related activities are regulated 
by supervisory agencies in the countries in which they 

conduct business. Certain of BNY Mellon’s public 

finance and advisory activities are regulated by the 

Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. Certain of 

BNY Mellon’s subsidiaries are registered with the 

CFTC as commodity pool operators or commodity 

trading advisors and, as such, are subject to CFTC 

regulation. BNY Mellon also has a subsidiary that 

clears futures and derivatives trades on behalf of 

institutional clients and is registered with the CFTC as 

a futures commission merchant and is a member of 

the National Futures Association. The Bank of New 

York Mellon provisionally registered as a Swap 

Dealer (as defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) with the 

CFTC, through the National Futures Association. As a 

Swap Dealer, The Bank of New York Mellon is 

subject to regulation, supervision and examination by 

the CFTC. In connection with certain Dodd-Frank 

clearing requirements, The Bank of New York Mellon 

became a member of LCH Clearnet Limited’s 

SwapClear interest rate swap clearing service in 2012. 
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment 
advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 

as amended, and as such are supervised by the SEC. 

They are also subject to various U.S. federal and state 

laws and regulations and to the laws and regulations 

of any countries in which they conduct business. Our 

subsidiaries advise both public investment companies 

which are registered with the SEC under the 

Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “’40 Act”), 

including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, and 

private investment companies which are not registered 

under the ‘40 Act. 
Certain of our investment management, trust and 
custody operations provide services to employee 

benefit plans that are subject to the Employee 

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 

(“ERISA”), administered by the U.S. Department of 

Labor. ERISA imposes certain statutory duties, 

liabilities, disclosure obligations, and restrictions on 

fiduciaries, as applicable, related to the services being 

performed and fees being paid. Certain proposed 

expansions of the definition of a fiduciary could 

require certain BNY Mellon businesses to modify 

their practices, which could adversely affect results of 

such businesses. 
Operations and Regulations Outside of the United 
States In Europe, The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV 
(“BNY Mellon SA/NV”) is a public limited liability 

company incorporated under the laws of Belgium. 
98 BNY Mellon 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) BNY Mellon SA/NV, which has been granted a 
banking license by the National Bank of Belgium, is 

authorized to carry out all banking and savings 

activities as a credit institution. BNY Mellon SA/NV 

conducts its activities in Belgium as well as through 

branch offices in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, 

the Netherlands, France and Germany. 
Effective Feb. 1, 2013, The Bank of New York 
Mellon (Ireland) Limited (the “Irish Bank”) merged 

with the BNY Mellon SA/NV. As part of the merger 

process, BNY Mellon SA/NV established a branch in 

Ireland. As of and from Feb. 1, 2013, this branch 

carries on the business activity in Ireland which was 

previously conducted by the Irish Bank. 
Certain of our financial services operations in the UK 
are subject to regulation by and supervision of the 

FSA. The FSA has broad supervisory and disciplinary 

powers, which include the power to revoke the 

authorization to carry on regulated business following 

a breach of the UK Financial Services and Markets 

Act 2000 (“FSMA 2000”) and/or regulatory rules, the 

suspension of registered employees and censures and 

fines for both regulated businesses and their registered 

employees. The FSA regulates The Bank of New 

York Mellon (International) Limited, our UK-

chartered bank, as well as the UK branches of The 

Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon SA/NV. 

In addition, the FSA regulates our trust and depositary 

and certain of our corporate trust businesses. Certain 

of BNY Mellon’s UK incorporated subsidiaries are 

authorized to conduct investment business in the UK 

pursuant to the FSMA 2000. Their investment 

management advisory activities and their sale and 

marketing of retail investment products are regulated 

by the FSA. Certain UK investment funds, including 

BNY Mellon Investment Funds, an open-ended 

investment company with variable capital advised by 

UK-regulated subsidiaries of BNY Mellon, are 

registered with the FSA and are offered for retail sale 

in the UK. The UK government has announced that it 

intends to abolish the FSA and to establish in its place 

three new regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy 

Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority and 

the Financial Conduct Authority. All changes are 

expected to take effect early-to mid-2013. 
The European Union (“EU”) Commission has 
proposed a regulation conferring powers on the 

European Central Bank (the “ECB”) for the prudential 

supervision of all banks in the Eurozone, with a 

mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a 

voluntary basis. The ECB and EU Member State 

National Competent Authorities will together be a 
Single Supervisory Mechanism (“SSM”). Key 

proposals address the scope of those credit institutions 

that will fall within the SSM, how they will be 

supervised and regulated and the investigation, 

enforcement and other powers of the ECB. Certain of 

BNY Mellon’s European subsidiaries would fall 

within the SSM, including most likely BNY Mellon 

SA/NV. In addition, a Recovery and Resolution 

Directive has been proposed and is expected to be 

voted on in the European Parliament in early-to mid=

2013. This Directive would set out a recovery and 

resolution framework for the EU, similar in some 

respects to the Federal Reserve’s and FDIC’s 

resolution plan rules described above under 

“Resolution Planning”, and would provide a minimum 

set of harmonized tools and powers to resolve or 

implement recovery of relevant credit institutions and 

other firms and entities, including branches of non-

EEA banks operating within the EEA. Key elements 

include the preparation of recovery and resolution 

plans; removing barriers to resolution; entering into 

intra-group financial support arrangements; giving 

relevant EEA regulators responsible for supervision, 

powers to impose certain requirements on an 

institution that is in financial difficulty before 

resolution actions become necessary; and giving 

authorities a set of resolution tools and powers to 

facilitate the resolution of failing entities, such as the 

power to “bail-in” the debt of an institution and the 

power to require a firm to change their legal or 

operating structure to remove impediments to 

resolvability. Various BNY Mellon subsidiaries and 

branches are expected to fall within the scope of this 

Directive. In addition, the Capital Requirements Directive IV 
(and related Regulation) (“CRD IV”) will affect BNY 

Mellon’s EU subsidiaries by implementing Basel III 

and other changes, including the enhancement of the 

quality of capital, and the strengthening of capital 

requirements for counterparty credit risk, resulting in 

higher capital requirements. Elements of CRD IV will 

apply not only to BNY Mellon banking branches and 

subsidiaries but also to investment management and 

brokerage entities. 
Our Investment Management and Investment Services 
businesses are subject to significant regulation in 

numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, 

among other things, the safeguarding, administration 

and management of client assets and client funds. 

Various new and revised European Directives will 

impact our provision of these services, including 

revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments 

Directive, the new Alternative Investment Fund 
BNY Mellon 99 
Supervision and Regulation (continued) Managers Directive, the Directive on Undertakings 
for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, 

the Central Securities Depository Regulation, the 

European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the 

Securities Law Legislation. These new and revised 

European Directives will impact our operations and 

risk profile and provide new opportunities for the 

provision of BNY Mellon products and services. 
The types of activities in which the foreign branches 
of our banking subsidiaries and our international 
subsidiaries may engage are subject to various 

restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those 

foreign branches and international subsidiaries are 

also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of 

the countries in which they operate and, in the case of 

banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory 

capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they 

operate. As of Dec. 31, 2012, each of BNY Mellon’s 

non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above 

their specified minimum requirements.

Recent Accounting DevelopmentsRecently Issued Accounting Standards 
ASU 2011-11—Disclosures about Offsetting Assets 
and Liabilities In December 2011, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting 

Standards Update (“ASU 2011-11”), “Disclosures 

about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities”. Entities are 

required to disclose both gross information and net 

information about both instruments and transactions 

eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments 

and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a 

master netting arrangement. This scope would include 

derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements and 

reverse sale and repurchase agreements, and securities 

borrowing and securities lending arrangements. The 

objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison 

between those entities that prepare their financial 

statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those 

entities that prepare their financial statements on the 

basis of IFRS. The amendments are effective for 

reporting periods beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2013. 

An entity would be required to provide the disclosures 

required by those amendments retrospectively for all 

comparative periods presented. Additionally, on Jan. 

31, 2013 the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, 

Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting 

Assets and Liabilities. ASU 2013-01 clarifies that 

ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in 

the scope of ASU No. 2011-11. This ASU will not 

impact our results of operations. 
ASU 2012-02—Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible 
Assets for Impairment 
In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, 
“Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for 

Impairment”. This guidance allows an entity an option 

to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether 

it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 

percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is 

impaired. If the intangible asset is impaired, an entity 

is required to perform the quantitative impairment 

test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair 

value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and 

perform the quantitative impairment test unless the 

entity determines that it is more likely than not that 

the asset is impaired. An entity choosing to perform 

the qualitative assessment would need to identify and 

consider the events and circumstances that, 

individually or in the aggregate, most significantly 

affect an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value. 

Examples of events and circumstances that should be 

considered, include deterioration in the entity’s 
operating environment, entity-specific events, such as 

a change in management, and overall financial 

performance, such as negative or declining cash 

flows. An entity also should consider any positive and 

mitigating events and circumstances, as well as 

whether there have been changes to the carrying 

amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. An 

entity can choose to perform the qualitative 

assessment on none, some, or all of its indefinite-lived 

intangible assets. An entity can bypass the qualitative 

assessment and perform the quantitative impairment 

test for any indefinite-lived intangible in any period. 

This ASU is effective for annual and interim 

impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning 

after Sept. 15, 2012. 
ASU 2013-02—Reporting of Amounts Reclassified 
Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, 
“Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. This 

ASU requires the presentation of the effects on the 

line items of net income of significant amounts 

reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive 

income – but only if the item reclassified is required 

under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in 

its entirety in the same reporting period; and a cross-

reference to other disclosures currently required under 

U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are 
not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified 

directly to net income in their entirety in the same 

reporting period. However, it will not amend the 

current requirements for the reporting of net income 

or other comprehensive income in the financial 

statements. The amendments are effective for 

reporting periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2012. 
Proposed Accounting Standards 
Proposed ASU—Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers In June 2010, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. This 

proposed ASU is the result of a joint project of the 
FASB and the IASB to clarify the principles for 
recognizing revenue and develop a common standard 
for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This proposed ASU would 
establish a broad principle that would require an entity 
to identify the contract with a customer, identify the 
separate performance obligations in the contract, 
determine the transaction price, allocate the 

transaction price to the separate performance 

obligations and recognize revenue when each separate 
BNY Mellon 101 
Recent Accounting Developments (continued) performance obligation is satisfied. In 2011, the 
FASB and the IASB revised several aspects of the 

original proposal to include distinguishing between 

goods and services, segmenting contracts, accounting 

for warranty obligations and deferring contract 

origination costs. 
In November 2011, the FASB re-exposed the 
proposed ASU. A final standard is expected to be 

issued in 2013. A retrospective application transition 

method would be permitted, but the FASB and IASB 

provides a practicable expedient to reduce the burden 

on preparers. The FASB and IASB tentatively decided 

that the effective date of the proposed standard would 

be annual reporting periods beginning on or after Jan. 

1, 2017. Proposed ASU—Principal versus Agent Analysis 

In November 2011, the FASB issued a proposed ASU 
“Principal versus Agent Analysis”. This proposed 

ASU would rescind the 2010 indefinite deferral of 

FAS 167 for certain investment funds, including 

mutual funds, hedge funds, mortgage real estate 

investment funds, private equity funds, and venture 

capital funds, and amends the pre-existing guidance 

for evaluating consolidation of voting general 

partnerships and similar entities. The proposed ASU 

also amends the criteria for determining whether an 

entity is a variable interest entity under FAS 167, 

which could affect whether an entity is within its 

scope. Accordingly, certain funds that previously were 

not consolidated must be reviewed to determine 

whether they will now be required to be consolidated. 

The proposed accounting standard will continue to 

require BNY Mellon to determine whether or not it 

has a variable interest in a variable interest entity. 

However, consolidation of its variable interest entity 

and voting general partnership asset management 

funds will be based on whether or not BNY Mellon, 

as the asset manager, uses its power as a decision 

maker as either a principal or an agent. Based on a 

preliminary review of the proposed ASU, we do not 

expect to be required to consolidate additional mutual 

funds, hedge funds, mortgage real estate investment 

funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds. 

In addition, we expect to de-consolidate a substantial 

portion of the CLOs we currently consolidate, with 

further deconsolidation possible depending on future 

changes to BNY Mellon’s investment in subordinated 

notes. The FASB is currently evaluating comment 

letters received. A final ASU is expected to be issued 

during the second quarter of 2013. 
FASB and IASB project on Leases 
In August 2010, the FASB and IASB issued a joint 
proposed ASU, “Leases”. FASB has tentatively 

decided that lessees would apply a “right-of-use” 

accounting model. This would require the lessee to 

recognize both a right-of-use asset and a 

corresponding liability to make lease payments at the 

lease commencement date, both measured at the 

present value of the lease payments. The right-of-use 

asset would be amortized on a systematic basis that 

would reflect the pattern of consumption of the 

economic benefits of the leased asset. The liability to 

make lease payments would be subsequently de=

recognized over time by applying the effective interest 

method to apportion the periodic payment to 

reductions in the liability to make lease payments and 

interest expense. Lessors would account for leases by 

applying a “receivable and residual” accounting 

approach for those leases where the lessee acquires 

and consumes more than an insignificant portion of 

the underlying asset over the lease term. The lessor 

would recognize a right to receive lease payments and 

a residual asset at the date of the commencement of 

the lease. The lessor would initially measure the right 

to receive lease payments at the sum of the present 

value of the lease payments, discounted using the rate 

the lessor charges the lessee. The lessor would 

initially measure the residual asset as an allocation of 

the carrying amount of the underlying asset and would 

subsequently measure the residual asset by accreting it 

over the lease term, using the rate the lessor charges 

the lessee. The FASB is expected to re-expose the 

standard during 2013. 
Proposed ASU—Financial Instruments—Credit 
Losses In December 2012, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses”. This proposed 

ASU would result in a single model to account for credit 

losses on financial assets. The proposal would remove 

the probable threshold for recognizing credit losses and 

require an estimate of the contractual cash flows an 

entity does not expect to collect on financial assets not 

measured at fair value through the income statement. 

The proposal would also change current practice for 

recognizing other-than-temporary impairment and 

interest income on debt securities. In addition, the 

proposal would result in the recognition of an allowance 

for credit losses for nearly all types of debt instruments. 

The proposal would expand the credit quality disclosures 

to require information about changes in the factors that 

influence estimates of credit losses and the reasons for 

those changes. Comments on this proposed ASU are due 

on April 30, 2013. 
102 BNY Mellon 
Recent Accounting Developments (continued) Proposed ASU—Effective Control for Transfers with 
Forward Agreements to Repurchase Assets and 

Accounting for Repurchase Financings 
In January 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
“Effective Control for Transfers with Forward 

Agreements to Repurchase Assets and Accounting for 

Repurchase Financings.” This proposed ASU would 

require certain repurchase agreements to be accounted 

for as secured borrowings. For repurchase agreements 

and similar transactions accounted for as secured 

borrowings, an entity would be required to disclose 

the carrying value of the borrowing disaggregated by 

the type of collateral pledged. Comments on this 

proposed ASU are due on March 29, 2013. 
Proposed ASU—Recognition and Measurement of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In February 2013, the FASB issued a proposed ASU, 
“Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets 

and Financial Liabilities.” This proposed ASU would 

affect entities that hold financial assets and liabilities 

and would change the methodology related to 

recognition, classification, measurement and 

presentation of financial instruments. The scope of the 

proposed ASU would exclude instruments classified 

in shareholder’s equity, share-based arrangements, 

pension plans, leases, guarantees and derivative 

instruments accounted under ASC 815. Financial 

assets would be classified and measured based on the 

instrument’s cash flow characteristics and an entity’s 

business model for managing the instrument. 

Financial liabilities would generally be measured 

initially at their transaction price. The proposal 

includes three principal classification and 

measurement categories: (1) fair value for which all 

changes in fair value are recognized in net income; 

(2) fair value with qualifying changes in fair value 
recognized in other comprehensive income; and 

(3) amortized cost. This proposed ASU requires 
financial assets and liabilities to be presented 

separately on the balance sheet by measurement 

category. In addition, the fair value of financial assets 

and liabilities accounted for under amortized cost 

would be presented parenthetically on the balance 

sheet. Comments on this proposed ASU are due on 

May 15, 2013. 
Adoption of new accounting standards 

For a discussion of the adoption of new accounting 
standards, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 
IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
are a set of standards and interpretations adopted by 

the International Accounting Standards Board. The 

SEC is currently considering a potential IFRS 

adoption process in the United States, which would, in 

the near term, provide domestic issuers with an 

alternative accounting method and ultimately could 

replace U.S. GAAP reporting requirements with IFRS 

reporting requirements. The intention of this adoption 

would be to provide the capital markets community 

with a single set of high-quality, globally accepted 

accounting standards. The adoption of IFRS for U.S. 

companies with global operations would allow for 

streamlined reporting, allow for easier access to 

foreign capital markets and investments, and facilitate 

cross-border acquisitions, ventures or spin-offs. 
In November 2008, the SEC proposed a “roadmap” 
for phasing in mandatory IFRS filings by U.S. public 

companies. The roadmap is conditional on progress 

towards milestones that would demonstrate 

improvements in both the infrastructure of 

international standard setting and the preparation of 

the U.S. financial reporting community. In February 

2010, the SEC issued a statement confirming their 

position that they continue to believe that a single set 

of high-quality, globally accepted accounting 

standards would benefit U.S. investors. The SEC 

continues to support the dual goals of improving 

financial reporting in the United States and reducing 

country-by-country disparities in financial reporting. 

The SEC is developing a work plan to aid in its 

evaluation of the impact of IFRS on the U.S. 

securities market. 
In May 2011, the SEC published a staff paper, 
“Exploring a Possible Method of Incorporation”, that 

presents a possible framework for incorporating IFRS 

into the U.S. financial reporting system. In the staff 

paper, the SEC staff elaborates on an approach that 

combines elements of convergence and endorsement. 

This approach would establish an endorsement 

protocol for the FASB to incorporate newly issued or 

amended IFRS into U.S. GAAP. During a transition 

period (e.g., five to seven years), differences between 

IFRS and U.S. GAAP would be potentially eliminated 

through ongoing FASB standard setting. 
In July 2012, the SEC staff released its final report on 
IFRS. This Final Report will be used by the SEC 

Commissioners to decide whether and, if so, when and 

how to incorporate IFRS into the financial reporting 

system for U.S. companies. The staff has not 
BNY Mellon 103 
Recent Accounting Developments (continued) specifically requested comments on the Final Report. 
It is not known when the SEC will make a final 

decision on the adoption of IFRS in the U.S. 
While the SEC decides whether IFRS will be required 
to be used in the preparation of our consolidated 

financial statements, a number of countries have 

mandated the use of IFRS by BNY Mellon’s 

subsidiaries in their statutory reports. Such countries 

include Belgium, Brazil, the Netherlands, Australia, 

Hong Kong, Canada and South Korea. 
Proposed Update to Internal Controls—Integrated 
Framework In December 2011, The Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission 

(“COSO”) issued for public comment a proposed 

update to Internal Control—Integrated Framework. 

The original Framework, issued in 1992, is used by 

most U.S. public companies and many others to 

evaluate and report on the effectiveness of their 

internal control over external financial reporting. 
Since the original Framework was introduced, 
business has become increasingly global and complex. 

Regulatory regimes also have expanded, and 

additional forms of external reporting are emerging. 
The COSO Board has updated the original Framework 

to make it more relevant to investors and other 

stakeholders. The more significant proposed changes to the original 
Framework include: applying a principles-based 

approach, clarifying the role of objective-setting in 

internal control, reflecting the increased relevance of 

technology, enhancing governance concepts, 

expanding the objectives of financial reporting, 

enhancing consideration of anti-fraud expectations, 

and considering different business models and 

organizational structures. 
In September 2012, COSO released a draft of its 
Internal Control Over External Financial Reporting 

(“ICEFR”): Compendium of Approaches and 

Examples (“the Compendium”). The Compendium 

provides guidance on applying COSO’s Internal 

Control -Integrated Framework to external financial 

reporting. COSO also released a revised version of its 

Internal Control -Integrated Framework (“ICIF”) that 

incorporates changes based on comments received. 

Comments on the Compendium and the revised ICIF 

were due on Nov. 20, 2012. 
The final document is expected to be issued in the first 
quarter of 2013. 
104 BNY Mellon 
Business ContinuityWe are prepared for events that could damage our 
physical facilities, cause delay or disruptions to 

operational functions, including telecommunications 

networks, or impair our employees, clients, vendors 

and counterparties. Key elements of our business 

continuity strategies are extensive planning and 

testing, and diversity of business operations, data 

centers and telecommunications infrastructure. 
We have established multiple geographically diverse 
locations for our funds transfer and broker-dealer 

services operational units, which provide redundant 

functionality to facilitate uninterrupted operations. 
Our securities clearing, commercial paper, mutual 
fund accounting and custody, securities lending, 

master trust, Unit Investment Trust, corporate trust, 

item processing, wealth management and treasury 

units have common functionality in multiple sites 

designed to facilitate continuance of operations or 

rapid recovery. In addition, we have recovery 

positions for over 13,400 employees on a global basis 

of which over 7,500 are proprietary. 
We continue to enhance geographic diversity for 
business operations by moving additional personnel to 

growth centers outside of existing major urban 

centers. We replicate 100% of our critical production 

computer data to multiple recovery data centers. 
We have an active telecommunications diversity 
program. All major buildings and data centers have 

diverse telecommunications carriers. The data centers 

have multiple fiber optic rings and have been designed 

so that there is no single point of failure. 
All major buildings have been designed with diverse 
telecommunications access and connect to at least two 

geographically dispersed connection points. We have 

an active program to audit circuits for route diversity 

and to test customer back-up connections. 
In 2003, the Federal Reserve, OCC and SEC jointly 
published the Interagency Paper, “Sound Practices to 

Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial 

System” (“Sound Practices Paper”). The purpose of 

the document was to define the guidelines for the 

financial services industry and other interested parties 

regarding “best practices” related to business 

continuity planning. Under these guidelines, we are a 

key clearing and settlement organization required to 

meet a higher standard for business continuity. 
We believe we meet substantially all of the 
requirements of the Sound Practices Paper. As a core 
clearing and settlement organization, we believe that 

we are at the forefront of the industry in improving 

business continuity practices. 
We are committed to seeing that requirements for 
business continuity are met not just within our own 

facilities, but also within those of vendors and service 

providers whose operation is critical to our safety and 

soundness. To that end, we have a Service Provider 

Management Office whose function is to review new 

and existing service providers and vendors to see that 

they meet our standards for business continuity, as 

well as for information security, financial stability, 

and personnel practices, etc. 
We have developed a comprehensive plan to prepare 
for the possibility of a flu pandemic, which anticipates 

significant reduced staffing levels and will provide for 

increased remote working by staff for one or more 

periods lasting several weeks. 
Although we are committed to observing best 
practices as well as meeting regulatory requirements, 

geopolitical uncertainties and other external factors 

will continue to create risk that cannot always be 

identified and anticipated. 
Due to BNY Mellon’s robust business recovery 
systems and processes, we are not materially impacted 

by climate change, nor do we expect material impacts 

in the near term. We have, and will continue to, 

implement processes and capital projects to deal with 

the risks of the changing climate. The company has 

invested in the development of products and services 

that support the markets related to climate change. 
In October 2012, several of our facilities in the 
northeastern U.S. were impacted by Superstorm 

Sandy. Our business continuity plans functioned well 

in the storm and its aftermath. 
BNY Mellon 105 
Supplemental Information (unaudited)Explanation of Non-GAAP financial measures BNY Mellon has included in this Annual Report 
certain Non-GAAP financial measures based upon 

tangible common shareholders’ equity. BNY Mellon 

believes that the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to 

risk-weighted assets and the ratio of tangible common 

shareholders’ equity to tangible assets of operations 

are measures of capital strength that provide 

additional useful information to investors, 

supplementing the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios 

which are utilized by regulatory authorities. The ratio 

of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted 

assets excludes preferred stock, as well as the trust 

preferred securities, which will be phased out of Basel 

I Tier 1 regulatory capital beginning in 2013. Unlike 

the Basel I Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the tangible 

common shareholders’ equity ratio fully incorporates 

those changes in investment securities valuations 

which are reflected in total shareholders’ equity. In 

addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the 

actual book value of assets, as opposed to a 

percentage of a risk-based reduced value established 

in accordance with regulatory requirements, although 

BNY Mellon in its calculation has excluded certain 

assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting 

for regulatory purposes. Further, BNY Mellon 

believes that the return on tangible common equity 

measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible 

assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful 

additional measure for investors because it presents a 

measure of BNY Mellon’s performance in reference 

to those assets which are productive in generating 

income. BNY Mellon has presented its estimated 

Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio on a basis that is 

representative of how it currently understands the 

Basel III rules. Management views the Basel III Tier 1 

common equity ratio as a key measure in monitoring 

BNY Mellon’s capital position. Additionally, the 

presentation of the Basel III Tier 1 common equity 

ratio allows investors to compare BNY Mellon’s 

Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio with estimates 

presented by other companies. See “Capital” for a 

reconciliation of total Tier 1 capital – Basel I to total 

estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity and total 

risk-weighted assets – Basel I to total estimated Basel 

III risk-weighted assets. 
BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book 
value per share, which it believes provides additional 

useful information as to the level of such assets in 

relation to shares of common stock outstanding. BNY 

Mellon has presented revenue measures, which 

exclude the effect of net securities gains (losses), 

SILO/LILO charges and noncontrolling interests 
related to consolidated investment management funds; 

expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, 

litigation charges, restructuring charges, amortization 

of intangible assets, support agreement charges and 

asset-based taxes; and measures which utilize net 

income excluding tax items such as the benefit of tax 

settlements and discrete tax benefits related to a tax 

loss on mortgages. Return on equity measures and 

operating margin measures, which exclude some or all 

of these items, are also presented. BNY Mellon 

believes that these measures are useful to investors 

because they permit a focus on period-to-period 

comparisons which relate to the ability of BNY 

Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in 

circumstances where such matters are within BNY 

Mellon’s control. The excluded items in general relate 

to certain ongoing charges as a result of prior 

transactions or where we have incurred charges. M&I 

expenses primarily relate to the 2007 merger of The 

Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon 

Financial Corporation and the Acquisitions in 2010. 

M&I expenses generally continue for approximately 

three years after the transaction and can vary on a 

year-to-year basis depending on the stage of the 

integration. BNY Mellon believes that the exclusion 

of M&I expenses provides investors with a focus on 

BNY Mellon’s business as it would appear on a 

consolidated going-forward basis, after such M&I 

expenses have ceased. Future periods will not reflect 

such M&I expenses, and thus may be more easily 

compared to our current results if M&I expenses are 

excluded. Litigation charges represent accruals for 

loss contingencies that are both probable and 

reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-

related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our 

operational excellence initiatives and migrating 

positions to global delivery centers. Excluding these 

charges permits investors to view expenses on a basis 

consistent with how management views the business. 

With regards to the exclusion of net securities gains 

(losses), BNY Mellon’s primary businesses are 

Investment Management and Investment Services. 

The management of these businesses is evaluated on 

the basis of the ability of these businesses to generate 

fee and net interest revenue and to control expenses, 

and not on the results of BNY Mellon’s investment 

securities portfolio. The investment securities 

portfolio is managed within the Other segment. The 

primary objective of the investment securities 

portfolio is to generate net interest revenue from the 

liquidity generated by BNY Mellon’s processing 

businesses. BNY Mellon does not generally originate 

or trade the securities in the investment securities 

portfolio. Excluding the discrete tax benefits related to 

a tax loss on mortgages and the benefit of tax 
106 BNY Mellon 
Supplemental Information (unaudited) (continued) settlements permits investors to calculate the tax 
impact of BNY Mellon’s primary businesses. 
The presentation of income of consolidated investment 
management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable 

to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of 

certain investment management funds, permits investors 

to view revenue on a basis consistent with prior periods. 

BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a 

supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a 

clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. 
In this Annual Report, the net interest margin is 

presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this 

presentation provides comparability of amounts 

arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and 

is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to 

an FTE basis has no impact on net income. 
Each of these measures as described above is used by 
management to monitor financial performance, both 

on a company-wide and business-level basis.

Estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio – (Non-GAAP) 
9.8% 7.1% (a)< The estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratios at Dec. 31, 2012 was based on the NPRs and final market risk rule. The estimated 
Basel III Tier1 common equity ratio at Dec. 31, 2011 was based on prior Basel III guidance and the proposed market risk rule. 
(b)< The NPRs and prior Basel III guidance do not add back to capital the adjustment to other comprehensive income that Basel I makes 

for pension liabilities and available-for-sale securities. Also, under the NPRs and prior Basel III guidance, pension assets recorded on 
the balance sheet and adjustments related to equity method investments are a deduction from capital. 
(c)< Primary differences between risk-weighted assets determined under Basel I compared with the NPRs and prior Basel III guidance 
include: the determination of credit risk under Basel I uses predetermined risk weights and asset classes and relies in part on the use 

of external credit ratings, while the NPRs use, in addition to the broader range of predetermined risk weights and asset classes, certain 

alternatives to external credit ratings. Securitization exposure receives a higher risk-weighting under the NPRs and prior Basel III 

guidance than Basel I; also, the NPRs and prior Basel III guidance include additional adjustments for operational risk, market risk, 

counterparty credit risk and equity exposures. 
(d)< Calculated on an Advanced Approaches basis, as amended by Basel III.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement of BNY Mellon is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control 

over financial reporting for BNY Mellon, as such term 

is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
BNY Mellon’s management, including its principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, has 

assessed the effectiveness of BNY Mellon’s internal 

control over financial reporting as of December 31, 

2012. In making this assessment, management used 

the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring 

Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 

Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based upon 
such assessment, management believes that, as of 

December 31, 2012, BNY Mellon’s internal control 

over financial reporting is effective based upon those 

criteria. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public 
accounting firm that audited BNY Mellon’s 2012 

financial statements included in this Annual Report 

under “Financial Statements and Notes,” has issued a 

report with respect to the effectiveness of BNY 

Mellon’s internal control over financial reporting. 

This report appears on page 120. 
BNY Mellon 119 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (“BNY Mellon”) internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework 

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). BNY Mellon’s 

management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report 

of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on BNY 

Mellon’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit 

included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 

weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 

assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 

circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 

assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 

only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 

company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 

controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 

policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, BNY Mellon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the 

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of BNY Mellon as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the 

related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of 

the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an 

unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

BNY Mellon 127 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1—Summary of significant accounting and reporting policies Basis of Presentation 
The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY 
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform 

to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) and prevailing industry practices. 
In the opinion of management, all adjustments 
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, 

results of operations and cash flows for the annual 

periods have been made. Certain other immaterial 

reclassifications have been made to prior years to place 

them on a basis comparable with current period 

presentation. Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make 

estimates based upon assumptions about future 

economic and market conditions which affect reported 

amounts and related disclosures in our financial 

statements. Although our current estimates 

contemplate current conditions and how we expect 

them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible 

that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated 

in those estimates, which could materially affect our 

results of operations and financial condition. Amounts 

subject to estimates are items such as the allowance 

for loan losses and lending-related commitments, the 

fair value of financial instruments and other-than=

temporary impairments, goodwill and intangible 

assets and pension accounting. Among other effects, 

such changes in estimates could result in future 

impairments of investment securities, goodwill and 

intangible assets and establishment of allowances for 

loan losses and lending-related commitments as well 

as changes in pension and post-retirement expense. 
Equity method investments 

The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries. Equity 

investments of less than a majority but at least 20% 

ownership are accounted for by the equity method and 

classified as other assets. Earnings on these 

investments are reflected in fee and other revenue as 

investment services fees or investment and other 
income, as appropriate, in the period earned. Our most 

significant equity method investments are: 
Equity method investments at Dec. 31, 2012 
(dollars in millions) Percentage ownership 
Book value CIBC Mellon 
50.0% $602 Wing Hang 20.7% $449 Siguler Guff 20.0% $272 ConvergEx 33.2% $117 Acquired businesses 
The income statement and balance sheet include 
results of acquired businesses accounted for under the 

acquisition method of accounting pursuant to ASC 

805, Business Combinations 
and equity investments 
from the dates of acquisition. For acquisitions 

completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we record the fair 

value of any contingent payments as an additional cost 

of the equity acquired in the period that the payment 

becomes probable. For acquisitions completed after 

Jan. 1, 2009, contingent purchase consideration was 

measured at its fair value and recorded on the 

purchase date. Any subsequent changes in the fair 

value of a contingent consideration liability will be 

recorded through the income statement. 
Parent financial statements 

The Parent financial statements in Note 20 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include 

the accounts of the Parent; those of a wholly-owned 

financing subsidiary that functions as a financing 

entity for BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries; and 

MIPA, LLC, a single-member limited liability 

company, created to hold and administer corporate-

owned life insurance. Financial data for the Parent, the 

financing subsidiary and the single-member limited 

liability company are combined for financial reporting 

purposes because of the limited function of these 

entities and the unconditional guarantee by BNY 

Mellon of their obligations. 
Nature of operations 

BNY Mellon is a global leader in providing a broad 
range of financial products and services in domestic 

and international markets. Through our two principal 

businesses, Investment Management and Investment 

Services, we serve the following major classes of 

customers—institutions, corporations, and high net 
128 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) worth individuals. For institutions and corporations, 
we provide the following services: 
Š investment management; 
Š trust and custody; 
Š foreign exchange; 
Š fund administration; 
Š securities lending; 
Š depositary receipts; 
Š corporate trust; 
Š global payment/cash management; 
Š banking services; and 
Š clearing services. 
For individuals, we provide mutual funds, separate 

accounts, wealth management and private banking 

services. BNY Mellon’s investment management 

businesses provide investment products in many asset 

classes and investment styles on a global basis. 
Variable interest entities 

Accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable 
interest entities (“VIEs”) is included in ASC 810 

Consolidation, ASU 2009-17 “Improvements to 

Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with 

Variable Interest Entities”, and ASU 2010-10 

“Amendments for Certain Investment Funds,” which 

defers ASU 2009-17 for certain asset managers’ 

interests in entities that apply the specialized 

accounting guidance for investment companies or that 

have the attributes of investment companies and for 

interests in money market funds. 
VIEs are defined as certain entities in which the 
equity investors: Šdo not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity 

to finance its activities without additional 

subordinated financial support; or 
Šlack one or more of the following characteristics 

of a controlling financial interest: 
Š The power, through voting rights or similar 

rights, to direct the activities of an entity that 

most significantly impact the entity’s 

economic performance (ASU 2009-17 

model). ŠThe direct or indirect ability to make 

decisions about the entity’s activities through 

voting rights or similar rights (ASC 810 

model). Š The obligation to absorb the expected losses 

of the entity. 
Š The right to receive the expected residual 

returns of the entity. 
We consider the underlying facts and circumstances 

of individual transactions when assessing whether or 

not an entity is a potential VIE. BNY Mellon is 

required to consolidate a VIE if BNY Mellon is 

determined to be the primary beneficiary. 
As a result of ASU 2010-10, BNY Mellon continues 
to apply ASC 810 to its mutual funds, hedge funds, 

private equity funds, collective investment funds and 

real estate investment trusts. If these entities are 

determined to be VIEs, primary beneficiary 

calculations are prepared in accordance with ASC 810 

to determine whether or not BNY Mellon is the 

primary beneficiary and required to consolidate the 

VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party 

that absorbs a majority of the VIE’s expected losses, 

receives a majority of its expected residual returns or 

both. BNY Mellon has two securitizations and several 
CLOs, which are assessed for consolidation in 

accordance with ASU 2009-17. The primary 

beneficiary of these VIE’s is the party that has both: 

(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that 
most significantly impact that entity’s economic 

performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses, 

or the right to receive benefits, from the VIE that 

could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
Voting interest entities 

If BNY Mellon can exert control over the financial 
and operating policies of an investee, which generally 

can occur if there is a 50% or more voting interest or 

if partners or members of an investee do not have 

certain substantive rights, BNY Mellon consolidates 

the investee. 
Investees structured as limited partnerships or limited 
liability companies for which BNY Mellon is either 

the general partner or managing member are 

presumed to be controlled by BNY Mellon. In 

accordance with ASC 810-20 
Control of Partnerships 

and Similar Entities, we review the rights of the 
limited partners and members to determine whether 

that presumption can be overcome. The presumption 

of control is overcome when the limited partners or 

managing members have the ability to dissolve the 

entity, can remove BNY Mellon, as the general 

partner or managing member without cause based on a 

simple majority vote of unaffiliated limited partners or 

members or have other substantive participating 

rights. If the presumption of control is not overcome, 

the entity is consolidated. 
BNY Mellon 129 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Trading account securities, available-for-sale 
securities, and held-to-maturity securities 
Securities are accounted for under ASC 320 
Investments—Debt and Equity Securities. 
Securities are generally classified in the trading, available-for=

sale investment or the held-to-maturity investment 

securities portfolios when they are purchased. 

Securities are classified as trading securities when our 

intention is to resell. Securities are classified as 

available-for-sale securities when we intend to hold 

the securities for an indefinite period of time or when 

the securities may be used for tactical asset/liability 

purposes and may be sold from time to time to 

effectively manage interest rate exposure, prepayment 

risk and liquidity needs. Securities are classified as 

held-to-maturity securities when we intend to hold 

them until maturity. 
Trading securities are stated at fair value. Trading 
revenue includes both realized and unrealized gains and 

losses. The liability incurred on short-sale transactions, 

representing the obligation to deliver securities, is 

included in trading liabilities at fair value. 
Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value. 
The difference between fair value and amortized cost 

representing unrealized gains or losses on assets 

classified as available-for-sale, are recorded net of tax 

as an addition to or deduction from other 

comprehensive income (“OCI”), unless a security is 

deemed to have an other-than-temporary impairment 

(“OTTI”). Gains and losses on sales of available-for=

sale securities are reported in the income statement. 

The cost of debt and equity securities sold is 

determined on a specific identification and average 

cost method, respectively. Held-to-maturity securities 

are stated at cost. 
Income on investment securities purchased is adjusted 
for amortization of premium and accretion of discount 

on a level yield basis. 
We routinely conduct periodic reviews to identify and 
evaluate each investment security to determine 

whether OTTI has occurred. We examine various 

factors when determining whether an impairment, 

representing the fair value of a security being below 

its amortized cost, is other than temporary. The 

following are examples of factors that BNY Mellon 

considers: ŠThe length of time and the extent to which the 

fair value has been less than the amortized cost 

basis; Š Whether management has an intent to sell the 

security; Š Whether the decline in fair value is attributable 

to specific adverse conditions affecting a 

particular investment; Š Whether the decline in fair value is attributable 

to specific conditions, such as conditions in an 

industry or in a geographic area; 
Š Whether a debt security has been downgraded 

by a rating agency; 
Š Whether a debt security exhibits cash flow 

deterioration; and 
Š For each non-agency RMBS, we compare the 

remaining credit enhancement that protects the 

individual security from losses against the 

projected losses of principal and/or interest 

expected to come from the underlying mortgage 

collateral, to determine whether such credit 

losses might directly impact the relevant 

security. The determination of whether a credit loss exists is based 

on best estimates of the present value of cash flows to be 

collected from the debt security. Generally, cash flows 

are discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the 

debt security at the time of acquisition. For debt 

securities that are beneficial interests in securitized 

financial assets and are not high credit quality, ASC 325 

provides that cash flows be discounted at the current 

yield used to accrete the beneficial interest. 
The credit component of an OTTI of a debt security is 
recognized in earnings and the non-credit component 

is recognized in OCI when we do not intend to sell the 

security and it is more likely than not that BNY 

Mellon will not be required to sell the security prior to 

recovery of its cost basis. 
For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of OTTI 
recorded in OCI for the non-credit portion of a previous 

OTTI is amortized prospectively, as an increase to the 

carrying amount of the security, over the remaining life 

of the security on the basis of the timing of future 

estimated cash flows of the securities. In order not to be 

required to recognize the non-credit component of an 

OTTI in earnings, management is required to assert that 

it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is 

more likely than not it will not have to sell the security 

before recovery of its cost basis. 
If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely 
than not that BNY Mellon will be required to sell the 

security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the non=

credit component of OTTI is recognized in earnings 
130 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) and subsequently accreted to interest income on an 
effective yield basis over the life of the security. 
The accounting policies for the determination of the 
fair value of financial instruments and OTTI have 

been identified as “critical accounting estimates” as 

they require us to make numerous assumptions based 

on available market data. See Note 5 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for these 

disclosures. Loans and leases 
Loans are reported net of any unearned discount. Loan 
origination and upfront commitment fees, as well as 

certain direct loan origination and commitment costs, are 

deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the 

lives of the related loans. Deferred fees and costs are 

netted against outstanding loan balances. Loans held for 

sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value. 
Unearned revenue on direct financing leases is 
accreted over the lives of the leases in decreasing 

amounts to provide a constant rate of return on the net 

investment in the leases. Revenue on leveraged leases 

is recognized on a basis to achieve a constant yield on 

the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the 

related deferred tax liability, in the years in which the 

net investment is positive. Gains and losses on 

residual values of leased equipment sold are included 

in investment and other income. Considering the 

nature of these leases and the number of significant 

assumptions, there is risk associated with the income 

recognition on these leases should any of the 

assumptions change materially in future periods. 
Nonperforming assets 

Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more, 

or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or 

principal will be collected. 
When a first lien residential mortgage loan reaches 90 
days delinquent, it is subject to an impairment test and 

may be placed on nonaccrual status. At 180 days 

delinquent, the loan is subject to further impairment 

testing. The loan will remain on accrual status if the 

realizable value of the collateral exceeds the unpaid 

principal balance plus accrued interest. If the loan is 

impaired, a charge-off is taken and the loan is placed 

on nonaccrual status. At 270 days delinquent, all first 

lien mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status. 

Second lien mortgages are automatically placed on 

nonaccrual status when they reach 90 days delinquent. 
When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, 

previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed 

against current period interest revenue. Interest 

receipts on nonaccrual and impaired loans are 

recognized as interest revenue or are applied to 

principal when we believe the ultimate collectability 

of principal is in doubt. Nonaccrual loans generally 

are restored to an accrual basis when principal and 

interest become current. 
A loan is considered to be impaired, as defined by 
ASC 310 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a 
Loan, when it is probable that we will be unable to 
collect all principal and interest amounts due 

according to the contractual terms of the loan 

agreement. An impairment allowance on loans $1 

million or greater is required to be measured based 

upon the loan’s market price, the present value of 

expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s 

initial effective interest rate, or at fair value of the 

collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the loan 

valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, 

an impairment allowance is established by a provision 

for credit loss. Impairment allowances are not needed 

when the recorded investment in an impaired loan is 

less than the loan valuation. 
Allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments 
The allowance for loan losses, shown as a valuation 
allowance to loans, and the allowance for lending-

related commitments recorded in other liabilities are 

referred to as BNY Mellon’s allowance for credit 

losses. The accounting policy for the determination of 

the adequacy of the allowances has been identified as a 

“critical accounting estimate” as it requires us to make 

numerous complex and subjective estimates and 

assumptions relating to amounts which are inherently 

uncertain. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb 
losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance 

sheet date based on our judgment. The allowance 

determination methodology is designed to provide 

procedural discipline in assessing the appropriateness 

of the allowance. Credit losses are charged against the 

allowance. Recoveries are added to the allowance. 
The methodology for determining the allowance for 
lending-related commitments considers the same 

factors as the allowance for loan losses, as well as an 

estimate of the probability of drawdown. We utilize a 

quantitative methodology and qualitative framework 

for determining the allowance for loan losses and the 
BNY Mellon 131 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) allowance for lending-related commitments. Within 
this qualitative framework, management applies 

judgment when assessing internal risk factors and 

environmental factors to compute an additional 

allowance for each component of the loan portfolio. 
The three elements of the allowance for loan losses 
and the allowance for lending-related commitments 

include the qualitative allowance framework. The 

three elements are: 
Š an allowance for impaired credits of $1 million 

or greater; 
Š an allowance for higher risk-rated credits and 

pass-rated credits; and 
Š an allowance for residential mortgage loans. 
Our lending is primarily to institutional customers. As 

a result, our loans are generally larger than $1 million. 

Therefore, the first element, impaired credits, is based 

on individual analysis of all impaired loans of $1 

million. The allowance is measured by the difference 

between the recorded value of impaired loans and 

their impaired value. Impaired value is either the 

present value of the expected future cash flows from 

the borrower, the market value of the loan, or the fair 

value of the collateral. 
The second element, higher risk-rated credits and 
pass-rated credits, is based on our probable loss 

model. All borrowers are assigned to pools based on 

their credit ratings. The probable loss inherent in each 

loan in a pool incorporates the borrower’s credit 

rating, loss given default rating and maturity. The loss 

given default incorporates a recovery expectation. The 

borrower’s probability of default is derived from the 

associated credit rating. Borrower ratings are 

reviewed at least annually and are periodically 

mapped to third-party databases, including rating 

agency and default and recovery databases, to ensure 

ongoing consistency and validity. Higher risk-rated 

credits are reviewed quarterly. All loans over $1 

million are individually analyzed before being 

assigned a credit rating. 
The third element, the allowance for residential 
mortgage loans, is determined by segregating six 

mortgage pools into delinquency periods ranging from 

current through foreclosure. Each of these 

delinquency periods is assigned a probability of 

default. A specific loss given default is assigned for 

each mortgage pool. In 2012, BNY Mellon began 

assigning all residential mortgage pools, except home 

equity lines of credit, a probability of default and loss 

given default based on five years of default and loss 
data derived from our residential mortgage portfolio. 

Prior to 2012, estimates of probability of default and 

loss given default factors were based on a 

combination of external data from third-party 

databases and internal data. The decision to change 

was triggered when five years of historical data 

became available in 2012. The use of internal 

historical data provides a better estimate of the 

allowance, given that it is based on actual default and 

loss experience on our residential mortgage portfolio. 

For each pool, the inherent loss is calculated using the 

above factors. The resulting probable loss factor (the 

probability of default multiplied by the loss given 

default) is applied against the loan balance to 

determine the allowance held for each pool. For home 

equity lines of credit, probability of default and loss 

given default are based on external data from third 

party databases due to the small size of the portfolio 

and insufficient internal data. 
The qualitative framework is used to determine an 
additional allowance for each portfolio based on the 

factors below: 
Internal risk factors: 
Š Nonperforming loans to total non-margin loans; 
Š Criticized assets to total loans and lending-
related commitments; 
Š Ratings volatility; 
Š Borrower concentration; and 
Š Significant concentration in high-risk industries. 
Environmental risk factors: 
Š U.S. noninvestment grade default rate; 
Š Unemployment rate; and 
Š Change in real GDP. 
The objective of the qualitative framework is to 

capture incurred losses that may not have been fully 

captured in the quantitative reserve which is based 

primarily on historical data. Management determines 

the qualitative allowance each period based on 

judgment informed by consideration of internal and 

external risk factors. Once determined in the 

aggregate, our qualitative allowance is then allocated 

to each of our loan classes based on the respective 

classes’ quantitative allowance balances with the 

allocations adjusted, when necessary, for class 

specific risk factors. 
For each risk factor, we calculate the minimum and 
maximum values, and percentiles in-between, to 

evaluate the distribution of our historical experience. 
132 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The distribution of historical experience is compared 
to the risk factor’s current quarter observed 

experience to assess the current risk inherent in the 

portfolio and overall direction/trend of a risk factor 

relative to our historical experience. 
Based on this analysis, we assign a risk level-no 
impact, low, moderate, high and elevated—to each 

risk factor for the current quarter. Management 

assesses the impact of each risk factor to determine an 

aggregate risk level. We do not quantify the impact of 

any particular risk factor. Management’s assessment 

of the risk factors, as well as the trend in the 

quantitative allowance, supports management’s 

judgment for the overall required qualitative 

allowance. A smaller qualitative allowance may be 

required when our quantitative allowance has 

reflected incurred losses associated with the aggregate 

risk level. A greater qualitative allowance may be 

required if our quantitative allowance does not yet 

reflect the incurred losses associated with the 

aggregate risk level. 
The allocation of allowance for credit losses is 
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for 

credit losses is available to absorb credit losses 

regardless of the nature of the loss. 
Premises and equipment 
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and amortization. 

Depreciation and amortization is computed using the 

straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 

the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, 

over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased 

facility or the estimated economic life of the 

improvement. For owned and capitalized assets, 

estimated useful lives range from two to 40 years. 

Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as 

incurred, while major improvements are capitalized 

and amortized to operating expense over their 

identified useful lives. 
Software 
BNY Mellon capitalizes costs relating to acquired 
software and internal-use software development 

projects that provide new or significantly improved 

functionality. We capitalize projects that are expected 

to result in longer-term operational benefits, such as 

replacement systems or new applications that result in 

significantly increased operational efficiencies or 

functionality. All other costs incurred in connection 
with an internal-use software project are expensed as 

incurred. Capitalized software is recorded in other 

assets. Identified intangible assets and goodwill 

Identified intangible assets with estimable lives are 
amortized in a pattern consistent with the assets’ 

identifiable cash flows or using a straight-line method 

over their remaining estimated benefit periods if the 

pattern of cash flows is not estimable. Intangible 

assets with estimable lives are reviewed for possible 

impairment when events or changed circumstances 

may affect the underlying basis of the asset. Goodwill 

and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized, 

but are assessed annually for impairment, or more 

often if events and circumstances indicate it is more 

likely than not they may be impaired. The accounting 

policy for valuing and impairment testing of identified 

intangible assets and goodwill has been identified as a 

“critical accounting estimate” as it requires us to make 

numerous complex and subjective estimates. See Note 

7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for additional disclosures related to goodwill and 

intangible assets. Seed capital 

Seed capital investments are classified as other assets. 
Unrealized gains and losses on seed capital 

investments are recorded in investment and other 

income. Noncontrolling interests 

Noncontrolling interests included in permanent equity 
are adjusted for the income or (loss) attributable to the 

noncontrolling interest holders and any distributions 

to those shareholders. Redeemable noncontrolling 

interests are reported as temporary equity. In 

accordance with ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities 
from Equity
, BNY Mellon recognizes changes in the 
redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling 

interests as they occur and adjusts the carrying value 

to be equal to the redemption value. 
Fee revenue 

We record investment services fees, investment 
management fees, foreign exchange and other trading 

revenue, financing-related fees, distribution and 

servicing, and other revenue when the services are 

provided and earned based on contractual terms, when 

amounts are determined and collectibility is 

reasonably assured. 
BNY Mellon 133 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Additionally, we recognize revenue from non=
refundable, upfront implementation fees under 

outsourcing contracts using a straight-line method, 

commencing in the period the ongoing services are 

performed through the expected term of the 

contractual relationship. Incremental direct set-up 

costs of implementation, up to the related 

implementation fee or minimum fee revenue amount, 

are deferred and amortized over the same period that 

the related implementation fees are recognized. If a 

client terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely, 

the unamortized deferred incremental direct set-up 

costs and the unamortized deferred up-front 

implementation fees related to that contract are 

recognized in the period the contract is terminated. 
Performance fees are recognized in the period in 
which the performance fees are earned and become 

determinable. Performance fees are generally 

calculated as a percentage of the applicable portfolio’s 

performance in excess of a benchmark index or a peer 

group’s performance. When a portfolio underperforms 

its benchmark or fails to generate positive 

performance, subsequent years’ performance must 

generally exceed this shortfall prior to fees being 

earned. Amounts billable in subsequent years and 

which are subject to a clawback if performance 

thresholds in those years are not met, are not 

recognized since the fees are potentially uncollectible. 

These fees are recognized when it is determined that 

they will be collected. When a multi-year performance 

contract provides that fees earned are billed ratably 

over the performance period, only the portion of the 

fees earned that are non-refundable are recognized. 
Net interest revenue 

Revenue on interest-earning assets and expense on 
interest-bearing liabilities is recognized based on the 

effective yield of the related financial instrument. 
Foreign currency translation 

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the rate of 

exchange on the balance sheet date. Transaction gains 

and losses are included in the income statement. 

Translation gains and losses on investments in foreign 

entities with functional currencies that are not the U.S. 

dollar are recorded as foreign currency translation 

adjustments in other comprehensive income (loss). 

Revenue and expense transactions are translated at the 

applicable daily rate or the weighted average monthly 

exchange rate when applying the daily rate is not 

practical. Pension The measurement date for BNY Mellon’s pension 
plans is Dec. 31. Plan assets are determined based on 

fair value generally representing observable market 

prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined 

based on the present value of projected benefit 

distributions at an assumed discount rate. The 

discount rate utilized is based on the yield curves of 

high-quality corporate bonds available in the 

marketplace. The net periodic pension expense or 

credit includes service costs, interest costs based on an 

assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan 

assets based on an actuarially derived market-related 

value and amortization of prior years’ actuarial gains 

and losses. 
Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan 
amendments, gains or losses related to changes in the 

amount of the projected benefit obligation or plan 

assets resulting from experience different from the 

assumed rate of return, changes in the discount rate or 

other assumptions. To the extent an actuarial gain or 

loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected 

benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan 

assets, the excess is recognized over the future service 

periods of active employees. 
Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 
based on anticipated returns for each applicable asset 

class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the 

expected allocation for each asset class and are based 

on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and 

fixed income markets, which should track the long=

term historical returns for these markets. We also 

consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global 

economies, as well as current and prospective interest 

rates. The market-related value utilized to determine the 
expected return on plan assets is based on the fair 

value of plan assets adjusted for the difference 

between expected returns and actual performance of 

plan assets. The difference between actual experience 

and expected returns on plan assets is included as an 

adjustment in the market-related value over a 5-year 

period. BNY Mellon’s accounting policy regarding pensions 
has been identified as a “critical accounting estimate” 

as it requires management to make numerous complex 

and subjective assumptions relating to amounts which 

are inherently uncertain. See Note 19 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

disclosures related to pensions. 
134 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Severance BNY Mellon provides separation benefits for U.S.=
based employees through The Bank of New York 

Mellon Corporation Supplemental Unemployment 

Benefit Plan. These benefits are provided to eligible 

employees separated from their jobs for business 

reasons not related to individual performance. Basic 

separation benefits are generally based on the 

employee’s years of continuous benefited service. 

Severance for employees based outside of the U.S. is 

determined in accordance with local agreements and 

legal requirements. Severance expense is recorded 

when management commits to an action that will 

result in separation and the amount of the liability can 

be reasonably estimated. 
Income taxes 
We record current tax liabilities or assets through 
charges or credits to the current tax provision for the 

estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current 

year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded 

for future tax consequences attributable to differences 

between the financial statement carrying amounts of 

assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 

enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 

in the years in which those temporary differences are 

expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax 

valuation allowance is established if it is more likely 

than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets 

will not be realized. A tax position that fails to meet a 

more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will result 

in either reduction of current or deferred tax assets, 

and/or recording of current or deferred tax liabilities. 

Interest and penalties related to income taxes are 

recorded as income tax expense. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative contracts, such as futures contracts, 
forwards, interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps 

and options and similar products used in trading 

activities are recorded at fair value. Gains and losses 

are included in foreign exchange and other trading 

revenue in fee and other revenue. Unrealized gains are 

recognized as trading assets and unrealized losses are 

recognized as trading liabilities, after taking into 

consideration master netting agreements. 
We enter into various derivative financial instruments 
for non-trading purposes primarily as part of our asset/ 

liability management (“ALM”) process. These 

derivatives are designated as either fair value or cash 
flow hedges of certain assets and liabilities when we 

enter into the derivative contracts. Gains and losses 

associated with fair value hedges are recorded in 

income as well as any change in the value of the 

related hedged item associated with the designated 

risks being hedged. Gains and losses on cash flow 

hedges are recorded in OCI, until reclassified into 

earnings to meet the risks being hedged. Foreign 

currency transaction gains and losses related to a 

hedged net investment in a foreign operation, net of 

their tax effect, are recorded with cumulative foreign 

currency translation adjustments within OCI. 
We formally document all relationships between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our 

risk-management objectives and strategy for 

undertaking various hedging transactions. 
We formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and 
on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are 

used in hedging transactions are highly effective and 

whether those derivatives are expected to remain 

highly effective in future periods. At inception, the 

potential causes of ineffectiveness related to each of 

our hedges is assessed to determine if we can expect 

the hedge to be highly effective over the life of the 

transaction and to determine the method for 

evaluating effectiveness on an ongoing basis. 
Recognizing that changes in the value of derivatives 
used for hedging or the value of hedged items could 

result in significant ineffectiveness, we have processes 

in place that are designed to identify and evaluate 

such changes when they occur. Quarterly, we perform 

a quantitative effectiveness assessment and record any 

ineffectiveness in current earnings. 
We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when 
we determine that a derivative is no longer an 

effective hedge, the derivative expires, is sold, or 

management discontinues the derivative’s hedge 

designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these 

derivatives are included in foreign exchange and other 

trading revenue. For discontinued fair value hedges, 

the accumulated gain or loss on the hedged item is 

amortized on a yield basis over the remaining life of 

the hedged item. Accumulated gains and losses, net of 

tax effect, from discontinued cash flow hedges are 

reclassified from OCI and recognized in current 

earnings in foreign exchange and other trading 

revenue upon receipt of the hedged cash flow. 
The accounting policy for the determination of the fair 
value of derivative financial instruments has been 

identified as a “critical accounting estimate” as it 
BNY Mellon 135 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) requires us to make numerous assumptions based on 
the available market data. See Note 24 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

disclosures related to derivative financial instruments. 
Statement of cash flows 

We have defined cash as cash and due from banks. 
Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in 

the same category as the items hedged. 
Stock options 

Compensation expense relating to all share-based 
payments is recognized in the income statement, on a 

straight-line basis, over the applicable vesting period. 
Certain of our stock compensation grants vest when 
the employee retires. ASC 718 requires the 

completion of expensing of new grants with this 

feature by the first date the employee is eligible to 

retire. Note 2—Accounting changes and new accounting guidance ASU 2011-04—Amendments to Achieve Common Fair 
Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in 

U.S. GAAP and IFRSs 
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, 

“Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value 

Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. 

GAAP and IFRSs”. The ASU clarifies the application 

of existing fair value measurement and disclosure 

requirements including 1) the application of concepts 

of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair 

value measurement are relevant only when measuring 

the fair value of non-financial assets and are not 

relevant when measuring the fair value of financial 

assets or any liabilities, 2) measuring the fair value of 

an instrument classified in shareholders’ equity from 

the perspective of a market participant that holds that 

instrument as an asset, and 3) disclosures about 

quantitative information regarding the unobservable 

inputs used in a fair value measurement that is 

categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

This ASU also requires the disclosure of the level of 

the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments not 

reported at fair value on the balance sheet. This ASU 

did not impact our results of operations. See Note 21 

“Fair value measurement” of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for the related 

disclosures. ASU 2011-05—Presentation of Comprehensive 

Income In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, 
“Presentation of Comprehensive Income”. This ASU 

increased the prominence of other comprehensive 

income in the financial statements. The ASU requires 

the disclosure of comprehensive income and its 

components in one of two ways: a single continuous 

statement or in two separate but consecutive 

statements. The ASU did not change the components 

of other comprehensive income. This ASU did not 

impact our results of operations. BNY Mellon adopted 

the two-statement approach. See the Consolidated 

Comprehensive Income Statement and Note 17 “Other 

comprehensive income (loss)” of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for the related 

disclosures. ASU 2011-08—Testing Goodwill for Impairment 

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, 
“Testing Goodwill for Impairment”, which amended 

the guidance in ASC 350 for goodwill impairment. 

This ASU permits entities performing goodwill 

impairment tests the option of performing a 

qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value 

of the reporting unit (i.e., Step 1 of the goodwill 

impairment test). If entities determine, on the basis of 

qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting 

unit is more likely than not less than the carrying 

amount, the two-step impairment test would be 

required. The ASU did not change how goodwill was 

calculated or assigned to reporting units, or the annual 

goodwill impairment testing requirement. In addition, 

the ASU did not amend the requirement to perform 

interim goodwill impairment tests if events or 

circumstances warrant; however, it did revise the 

examples of events and circumstances that an entity 

should consider. The amendments were effective for 

annual and interim goodwill impairment tests 

performed for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 

2011. This ASU did not impact our results of 

operations. Note 3—Acquisitions and dispositions We sometimes structure our acquisitions with both an 
initial payment and later contingent payments tied to 

post-closing revenue or income growth. For 

acquisitions completed prior to Jan. 1, 2009, we 

record the fair value of contingent payments as an 

additional cost of the entity acquired in the period that 

the payment becomes probable. For acquisitions 

completed after Jan. 1, 2009, subsequent changes in 

the fair value of a contingent consideration liability 
136 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) will be recorded through the income statement. 
Contingent payments totaled $7 million in 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we were potentially obligated to 
pay additional consideration which, using reasonable 

assumptions for the performance of the acquired 

companies and joint ventures based on contractual 

agreements, could range from $15 million to $46 

million over the next two years. 
Acquisitions in 2012 

On Oct 1, 2012, BNY Mellon acquired the remaining 
50% interest of the WestLB Mellon Asset 

Management joint venture for cash of $22 million. We 

later renamed the unit Meriten Investment 

Management GmbH (“Meriten”). We are obligated to 

pay, upon occurrence of certain events, contingent 

additional consideration of up to $13 million. 

Goodwill related to this acquisition, including the fair 

value of the contingent additional consideration, 

totaled $70 million and is included in our Investment 

Management business. This goodwill is not deductible 

for tax purposes. Customer relationship intangible 

assets related to this acquisition are included in our 

Investment Management business, with a life of 8 

years, and totaled $23 million. 
Acquisitions in 2011 

On July 1, 2011, BNY Mellon acquired the wealth 
management operations of Chicago-based Talon Asset 

Management (“Talon”) for cash of $11 million. We 

are obligated to pay, upon occurrence of certain 

events, contingent additional consideration of $5 

million, which was recorded as goodwill at the 

acquisition date. Talon manages assets of wealthy 

families and institutions. Goodwill related to this 

acquisition, is included in our Investment 

Management business and totaled $10 million and is 

deductible for tax purposes. Customer relationship 

intangible assets related to this acquisition are 

included in our Investment Management business, 

with a life of 20 years, and totaled $6 million. 
On Nov. 30, 2011, BNY Mellon acquired Penson 
Financial Services Australia Pty Ltd., a clearing firm 

located in Australia, in a $33 million share purchase 

transaction. Goodwill related to this acquisition is 

included in our Investment Services business and 

totaled $10 million and is non-tax deductible. 

Customer relationship intangible assets related to this 

acquisition are included in our Investment Services 

business, with a life of nine years, and totaled $6 

million. Dispositions in 2011 
On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold the Shareowner 
Services business. The sales price of $550 million 

resulted in a pre-tax gain of $98 million. We recorded 

an immaterial after-tax gain primarily due to the write-

off of non-tax deductible goodwill associated with the 

business. Excluding the gain on the sale, the 

Shareowner Services business contributed $273 million 

of revenue and $21 million of pre-tax income in 2011. 
Acquisitions in 2010 

On July 1, 2010, we acquired GIS for cash of $2.3 
billion. GIS provides a comprehensive suite of 

products which includes subaccounting, fund 

accounting/administration, custody, managed account 

services and alternative investment services. Assets 

acquired totaled approximately $590 million. 

Liabilities assumed totaled approximately $250 

million. Goodwill related to this acquisition totaled 

$1,505 million, of which $1,256 million is tax 

deductible and $249 million is non-tax deductible. 

Customer contract intangible assets related to this 

acquisition totaled $477 million with lives ranging 

from 10 years to 20 years. 
On Aug. 2, 2010, we acquired BAS for cash of $370 
million. This transaction included the purchase of 

Frankfurter Service Kapitalanlage—Gesellschaft 

mbH, a wholly-owned fund administration affiliate. 

The combined business offers a full range of tailored 

solutions for investment companies, financial 

institutions and institutional investors in Germany. 

Assets acquired totaled approximately $3.6 billion and 

primarily consisted of securities of approximately 

$2.6 billion. Liabilities assumed totaled approximately 

$3.4 billion and included deposits of $2.3 billion. 

Goodwill related to this acquisition of $272 million is 

tax deductible. Customer contract intangible assets 

related to this acquisition totaled $40 million with a 

life of 10 years. 
On Sept. 1, 2010, we acquired I(3) Advisors of 
Toronto, an independent wealth advisory company, 

for cash of $21.1 million. Goodwill related to this 

acquisition totaled $8 million and is non-tax 

deductible. Customer relationship intangible assets 

related to this acquisition totaled $10 million with a 

life of 33 years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Temporarily impaired securities 
At Dec. 31, 2012, substantially all of the unrealized losses on the investment securities portfolio were attributable 
to credit spreads widening since purchase, and interest rate movements. We do not intend to sell these securities 

and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell. 
The following tables show the aggregate related fair value of investments with a continuous unrealized loss position 
for less than 12 months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more.

Other-than-temporary impairment 
We routinely conduct periodic reviews of all 
securities using economic models to identify and 

evaluate each investment security to determine 

whether OTTI has occurred. Various inputs to the 

economic models are used to determine if an 

unrealized loss on securities is other-than-temporary. 

For example, the most significant inputs related to 

non-agency RBMS are: 
Š Default rate—the number of mortgage loans 

expected to go into default over the life of the 

transaction, which is driven by the roll rate of 

loans in each performance bucket that will 

ultimately migrate to default; and 
Š Severity—the loss expected to be realized when 

a loan defaults. 
To determine if an unrealized loss is other-than=

temporary, we project total estimated defaults of the 

underlying assets (mortgages) and multiply that 

calculated amount by an estimate of realizable value 

upon sale of these assets in the marketplace (severity) 

in order to determine the projected collateral loss. We 

also evaluate the current credit enhancement 
underlying the bond to determine the impact on cash 

flows. If we determine that a given security will be 

subject to a write-down or loss, we record the 

expected credit loss as a charge to earnings. 
In addition, we have estimated the expected loss by 
taking into account observed performance of the 

underlying securities, industry studies, market 

forecasts, as well as our view of the economic outlook 

affecting collateral. The table below shows the projected weighted-
average default rates and loss severities for the 2007, 

2006 and late 2005 non-agency RMBS and the 

securities previously held in the Grantor Trust we 

established in connection with the restructuring of our 

investment securities portfolio in 2009, at Dec. 31, 

2012 and 2011.

were pledged primarily for potential borrowing at the 

Federal Reserve Discount Window. The significant 

components of pledged assets were as follows: $80 

billion of securities, $5 billion of interest-bearing 

deposits with banks and $5 billion of loans. Also 

included in these pledged assets were securities 

available-for-sale of $1 billion which were pledged as 

collateral for actual borrowings. The lenders in these 

borrowings have the right to repledge or sell these 

securities. We obtain securities under resale, securities 

borrowed and custody agreements on terms which 

permit us to repledge or resell the securities to others. 

As of Dec. 31, 2012, the market value of the securities 

received that can be sold or repledged was $31 billion. 

We routinely repledge or lend these securities to third 

parties. As of Dec. 31, 2012, the market value of 

collateral sold and repledged was $9 billion.

In the ordinary course of business, we and our banking 
subsidiaries have made loans at prevailing interest rates 

and terms to our directors and executive officers and to 

entities in which certain of our directors have an 

ownership interest or direct or indirect subsidiaries of 

such entities. The aggregate amount of these loans was 

$5 million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $3 million at both Dec. 

31, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2010. These loans are primarily 

extensions of credit under revolving lines of credit 

established for such entities. 
Our loan portfolio is comprised of three portfolio 
segments: commercial, lease financings and 

mortgages. We manage our portfolio at the class level 

which is comprised of six classes of financing 

receivables: commercial, commercial real estate, 

financial institutions, lease financings, wealth 

management loans and mortgages, and other 

residential mortgages. The following tables are 

presented for each class of financing receivable, and

Credit quality indicators Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade names to support cross-selling opportunities and avoid single 

name/industry concentrations. Each customer is assigned an internal rating grade which is mapped to an external 

rating agency grade equivalent based upon a number of dimensions which are continually evaluated and may 

change over time. 
The following tables set forth information about credit quality indicators.

grade and non-investment grade categories based on 

rating criteria largely consistent with those of the public 

rating agencies. Each customer in the portfolio is 

assigned an internal rating grade. These internal rating 

grades are generally consistent with the ratings 

categories of the public rating agencies. Customers with 

ratings consistent with BBB-(S&P)/Baa3 (Moody’s) or 

better are considered to be investment grade. Those 

clients with ratings lower than this threshold are 

considered to be non-investment grade.

4,142 3,781 Total $8,864 $7,342 Wealth management non-mortgage loans are not 
typically rated by external rating agencies. A majority 

of the wealth management loans are secured by the 

customers’ investment management accounts or 

custody accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these 

loans are typically investment grade, fixed income 

securities, equities and/or mutual funds. Internal 

ratings for this portion of the wealth management 

portfolio, therefore, would equate to investment-grade 

external ratings. Wealth management loans are 

provided to select customers based on the pledge of 

other types of assets, including business assets, fixed 

assets, or a modest amount of commercial real estate. 

For the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit 

quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do 

not consider this portfolio of loans to be investment 

grade. Credit quality indicators for wealth management 
mortgages are not correlated to external ratings. 

Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to 

high-net-worth individuals, which are secured 
BNY Mellon 147 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) primarily by residential property. These loans are 
primarily interest-only adjustable rate mortgages with 

an average loan to value ratio of 63% at origination. 

In the wealth management portfolio, 1% of the 

mortgages were past due at Dec. 31, 2012. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, the private wealth mortgage 
portfolio was comprised of the following geographic 

concentrations: New York – 22%; California – 19%; 

Massachusetts – 17%; Florida – 8%; and other – 34%. 
Other residential mortgages 

The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily 
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and 

totaled $1,632 million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $1,923 

million at Dec. 31, 2011. These loans are not typically 

correlated to external ratings. Included in this 

portfolio at Dec. 31, 2012 are $497 million of 

mortgage loans purchased in 2005, 2006 and the first 

quarter of 2007 that are predominantly prime 

mortgage loans, with a small portion of Alt-A loans. 

As of Dec. 31, 2012, the purchased loans in this 

portfolio had a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio 

of 75% at origination and 24% of these loans were at 

least 60 days delinquent. The properties securing the 

prime and Alt-A mortgage loans were located (in 

order of concentration) in California, Florida, 

Virginia, Maryland and the tri-state area (New York, 

New Jersey and Connecticut). 
Overdrafts 
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities 
clearance clients and totaled $5,298 million at Dec. 

31, 2012 and $4,849 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 

Overdrafts occur on a daily basis in the custody and 

securities clearance business and are generally repaid 

within two business days. 
Margin loans 
We had $13,397 million of secured margin loans on 
our balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$12,760 million at Dec. 31, 2011. Margin loans are 

collateralized with marketable securities and 

borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral 

margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We 

have rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans and 

do not allocate any of our allowance for credit losses 

to margin loans. 
Other loans 

Other loans primarily includes loans to consumers that 
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and 

fixed income securities, as well as bankers’ 

acceptances. Reverse repurchase agreements 
Reverse repurchase agreements are transactions fully 
collateralized with high-quality liquid securities. 

These transactions carry minimal credit risk and 

therefore are not allocated an allowance for credit 

losses. Note 7—Goodwill and intangible assets Impairment testing 

BNY Mellon’s three business segments include seven 
reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing 

is performed on an annual basis. The Investment 

Management segment is comprised of two reporting 

units. The Investment Services segment is comprised 

of four reporting units. One reporting unit is included 

in the Other segment. 
The goodwill impairment test is performed in two 
steps. The first step compares the estimated fair value 

of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, 

including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill 

of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. 

However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit 

were to exceed its estimated fair value, a second step 

would be performed that would compare the implied 

fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the 

carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss 

would be recorded to the extent that the carrying 

amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. 
BNY Mellon conducted its annual goodwill 
impairment test on a quantitative basis on all seven 

reporting units in the second quarter of 2012. The 

estimated fair value of each of the Company’s 

reporting units exceeded the carrying value and no 

goodwill impairment was recognized. 
Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested 
annually for impairment or more often if events or 

circumstances indicate they may be impaired. 
Goodwill 
The level of goodwill increased in 2012 compared 
with 2011 primarily as a result of foreign exchange 

translation on non-U.S. dollar denominated goodwill 

and the Meriten acquisiton. The table below provides 

a breakdown of goodwill by business.

In our Investment Management business, we manage 
investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 

money market and alternative investment funds for 

institutions and other investors. As part of that activity 

we make seed capital investments in certain funds. 

BNY Mellon also holds private equity investments, 

which consist of investments in private equity funds, 

mezzanine financings and direct equity investments. 

Seed capital and private equity investments are 

included in other assets. Consistent with our policy to 

focus on our core activities, we continue to reduce our 

exposure to private equity investments. 
The fair value of these investments has been estimated

Operational excellence initiatives 

In 2011, we announced our operational excellence 
initiatives which include an expense reduction 

initiative impacting approximately 1,500 positions or 

approximately 3% of our global workforce, as well as 

additional initiatives to transform operations, 

technology and corporate services that will increase 

productivity and reduce the growth rate of expenses. 

We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $107 

million related to the operational excellence initiatives 
BNY Mellon 151 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) in 2011. This charge was comprised of $78 million of 
severance costs and $29 million primarily for 

operating lease-related items and consulting costs. In 

2012, we recorded a net recovery of $2 million 

associated with the operational excellence initiatives. 

The net recovery in 2012 reflects additional severance 

charges and a lease restructuring, which were more 

than offset by a gain on the sale of a property. The

German net operating loss carryforward of $198 

million with an indefinite life. We have not recorded a 

valuation allowance because we expect to realize our 

deferred tax assets including these carryovers. 
As of Dec. 31, 2012, we had approximately 
$4.3 billion of earnings attributable to foreign 

subsidiaries that have been permanently reinvested 

abroad and for which no incremental U.S. income tax 

provision has been recorded. If these earnings were to 

be repatriated, the estimated U.S. tax liability as of 

Dec. 31, 2012 would be up to $930 million. 

Management has no intention of repatriating these 

earnings to the U.S. in the foreseeable future.

Our total tax reserves as of Dec. 31, 2012 were $340 
million compared with $250 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 

If these tax reserves were unnecessary, $340 million 

would affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We 

recognize accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, 

related to income taxes in income tax expense. 

Included in the balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2012 is 

accrued interest, where applicable, of $35 million. The 

additional tax expense related to interest for the year 

ended Dec. 31, 2012 was $11 million compared with 

$31 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011. 
As previously disclosed, on Nov. 10, 2009 BNY 
Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

challenging the IRS’ disallowance of certain foreign 

tax credits claimed for the 2001 and 2002 tax years. 

Trial was held from April 16 to May 17, 2012. 
On Feb. 11, 2013 BNY Mellon received an adverse 
decision from the U.S. Tax Court. We continue to 

believe the tax treatment of the transaction was correct 

and will appeal the Court’s decision. As a result of the 

ruling and in accordance with the accounting for 

uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, BNY Mellon 

expects to record a tax charge of approximately $850 

million during the first quarter of 2013. Excluding this 

charge, it is reasonably possible the total reserve for 

uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next 

12 months by an amount up to $67 million as a result 

of adjustments related to tax years that are still subject 

to examination. See Note 23 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

information. Our federal income tax returns are closed to 
examination for all periods through 2002. The years 

2003 through 2006 remain open to examination. The 

years 2007 and 2008 are closed for further 

examination, however one matter is before the 

Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) appeals. Our New 

York State and New York City income tax returns are 

closed to examination through 2010. Our UK income 

tax returns are closed to examination through 2008.

31, 2012, subordinated debt of $407 million may be 

redeemable at our option in 2013. 
Trust-preferred securities 

At Dec. 31, 2012, two wholly owned subsidiaries of 
BNY Mellon (the “Trusts”) have issued cumulative 

Company-Obligated Mandatory Redeemable Trust 

Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding 

Solely Junior Subordinated Debentures (“trust 

preferred securities”). The sole assets of these two 

trusts are junior subordinated deferrable interest 

debentures of BNY Mellon with maturities and 

interest rates that match the trust preferred securities. 

Our obligations under the agreements that relate to the 

trust preferred securities, the Trusts and the 

debentures constitute a full and unconditional 

guarantee by us of the Trusts’ obligations under the 

trust preferred securities. 
Additionally, at Dec. 31, 2012, we also owned Mellon 

Capital IV, whose sole assets were originally junior 

subordinated debentures and a stock purchase contract 

for preferred stock. Through a remarketing in May 

2012, the junior subordinated debentures issued by 

BNY Mellon and held by Mellon Capital IV were sold 

to third party investors and then exchanged for BNY 

Mellon’s senior notes, which were sold in a public 

offering. The proceeds of the sale of the senior notes 

were used to fund the purchase by Mellon Capital IV 

of $500 million of BNY Mellon’s Series A preferred 

stock, which was issued on June 20, 2012. At Dec. 31, 

2012, the Series A preferred stock was the sole asset 

of Mellon Capital IV. See Note 16 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

disclosures related to preferred stock, including the 

Series A preferred stock. 
On Nov. 26, 2012, BNY Mellon redeemed all 
outstanding 6.875% Trust Preferred Securities, Series 

E, issued by BNY Capital IV (liquidation amount $25 

per security and $200 million in the aggregate) and all 

outstanding 5.95% Trust Preferred Securities, Series

Note 15—Securitizations and variable interest entities BNY Mellon’s VIEs generally include retail, 
institutional and alternative investment funds offered 

to its retail and institutional customers in which it acts 

as the fund’s investment manager. BNY Mellon earns 

management fees on these funds as well as 

performance fees in certain funds. It may also provide 

start-up capital in its new funds. These VIEs are 

included in the scope of ASU 2010-10 and are 

reviewed for consolidation based on the guidance in 

ASC 810. BNY Mellon has other VIEs, including securitization 
trusts, which are no longer considered qualifying 

special purpose entities, and CLOs, in which BNY 

Mellon serves as the investment manager. In addition, 

we provide trust and custody services for a fee to 

entities sponsored by other corporations in which we 

have no other interest. These VIEs are evaluated 

under the guidance included in ASU 2009-17. BNY 

Mellon has two securitizations and several CLOs, 

which are assessed for consolidation in accordance 

with ASU 2009-17. 
The following tables present the incremental assets 
and liabilities included in BNY Mellon’s consolidated 

financial statements, after applying intercompany 

eliminations, as of Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, 

based on the assessments performed in accordance 

with ASC 810 and ASU 2009-17. The net assets of 

any consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the 

liabilities of the VIE and to settle any investors’ 
ownership liquidation requests, including any seed 

capital invested in the VIE by BNY Mellon.

On June 20, 2012, BNY Mellon issued the Series A 
preferred stock for $500 million. On Sept. 19, 2012, 

BNY Mellon issued 22 million and on Oct. 10, 2012, 

BNY Mellon issued an additional 1.3 million of Series 

C Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/4,000th 

interest in a share of BNY Mellon’s Series C preferred 

stock for an aggregate of $568 million, net of issuance 

costs. Holders of both the Series A and Series C 

preferred stock issues are entitled to receive dividends 

on each dividend payment date (March 20, June 20, 

Sept. 20 and Dec. 20 of each year), if declared by 

BNY Mellon’s Board of Directors. BNY Mellon’s 
ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, 

redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common 

stock or any of our shares that rank junior to the 

preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or 

the distribution of any assets on any liquidation, 

dissolution or winding-up of BNY Mellon will be 

prohibited, subject to certain restrictions, in the event 

that we do not declare and pay in full preferred 

dividends for the then current dividend period of the 

Series A preferred stock or the last preceding dividend 

period of the Series C preferred stock. 
156 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) All of the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred 
stock are owned by Mellon Capital IV, which will 

pass through any dividend on the Series A preferred 

stock to the holders of its Normal Preferred Capital 

Securities. All of the outstanding shares of the Series 

C preferred stock are held by the depositary of the 

depositary shares, which will pass through the 

applicable portion of any dividend on the Series C 

Preferred Stock to the holders of record of the 

depositary shares. 
The preferred stock is not subject to the operation of a 
sinking fund and is not convertible into, or 

exchangeable for, shares of our common stock or any 

other class or series of our other securities. Subject to 

the restrictions in BNY Mellon’s 2007 replacement 

capital covenant, subsequently amended on May 8 and 

Sept. 11, 2012, we may redeem the Series A preferred 

stock, in whole or in part, at our option. We may also, 

at our option, redeem the shares of the Series C 

preferred stock in whole or in part, on or after the 

dividend payment date in September 2017, or in 

whole but not in part at any time within 90 days 

following a regulatory capital treatment event (as 

defined in the Certificate of Designations of the Series 

C preferred stock). 
The terms of the Series A preferred stock and the 
Series C preferred stock are more fully described in 

each of their Certificate of Designations, each of 

which is filed as an exhibit to BNY Mellon’s Annual 

Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 

2012. Temporary equity 

Temporary equity was $178 million at Dec. 31, 2012 
and $114 million at Dec. 31, 2011. Temporary equity 

represents amounts recorded for redeemable non-

controlling interests resulting from equity-classified 

share-based payment arrangements that are currently 

redeemable or are expected to become redeemable. 

The current redemption value of such awards is 

classified as temporary equity and is adjusted to its 

redemption value at each balance sheet date. 
Common stock repurchase program 

On Dec. 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of BNY 
Mellon authorized the repurchase of up to 35 million 

shares of common stock. On March 22, 2011, the 

Board of Directors of BNY Mellon authorized the 

repurchase of up to an additional 13 million shares of 

common stock. On Feb. 14, 2012, in order to continue 
with share repurchases under our 2011 capital plan, 

the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an 

additional 12 million shares of common stock, of 

which 6.8 million shares of common stock remained 

available for repurchase under the Feb. 2012 board 

authorization. While there are no expiration dates on 

the prior share repurchase authorizations, BNY 

Mellon does not intend to use the prior authorizations 

for any future share repurchases. On March 13, 2012, 

in connection with the Federal Reserve’s non-

objection to our 2012 capital plan, the Board of 

Directors authorized a new stock purchase program 

providing for the repurchase of an aggregate of $1.16 

billion of common stock. The new share repurchase 

program may be executed through open market 

purchases or privately negotiated transactions at such 

prices, times and upon such other terms as may be 

determined from time to time. At Dec. 31, 2012, the 

maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be 

purchased under the program totaled $416 million. 

There is no expiration date on the share repurchase 

authorizations. In 2012, we repurchased 49.8 million 

common shares in the open market, at an average 

price of $22.38 per share for a total of $1.12 billion. 
Capital adequacy 

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank 
holding companies and banks, including BNY Mellon 

and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with 

established quantitative measurements. For the Parent 

to maintain its status as a financial holding company, 

our bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among 

other things, qualify as well capitalized. 
As of Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011, BNY Mellon and our 
bank subsidiaries were considered well capitalized on 

the basis of the Basel I Total and Tier 1 capital to risk-

weighted assets ratios and the leverage ratio (Basel I 

Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets as defined 

for regulatory purposes). 
BNY Mellon 157 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Our consolidated and largest bank subsidiary, The Bank 
of New York Mellon, capital ratios are shown below.

5.3 5.2 The Bank of New York Mellon capital ratios: 
Tier 1 capital 
14.0% 14.3% Total capital 14.6 17.7 Leverage 5.4 5.3 (a)< Determined under Basel I guidelines. For a banking 
institution to qualify as “well capitalized,” its Basel I Tier 1, 

Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) and leverage capital ratios must be 

at least 6%, 10% and 5%, respectively. For The Bank of New 

York Mellon, our largest bank subsidiary, to qualify as 
“adequately capitalized ,” Basel I Tier 1, Total and leverage 

capital ratios must be at least 4%, 8% and 3%, respectively. 
If a financial holding company such as BNY Mellon 
fails to qualify as well capitalized, it may lose its 

status as a financial holding company, which may 

restrict its ability to undertake or continue certain 

activities or make acquisitions that are not generally 

permissible for bank holding companies without 

financial holding company status. If a bank holding 

company such as BNY Mellon or bank such as The 

Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A. fails 

to qualify as “well capitalized,” it may be subject to 

higher FDIC assessments. 
If a bank holding company such as BNY Mellon or 
bank such as The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY 

Mellon, N.A. fails to qualify as adequately 

capitalized, regulatory sanctions and limitations are 

imposed. At Dec. 31, 2012, the amounts of capital by which 
BNY Mellon and The Bank of New York Mellon, 

exceed the well-capitalized guidelines are as follows:

984 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Note 18—Stock-based compensation Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted 

stock units (“RSUs”) and other stock-based awards to 

employees and directors of BNY Mellon. At Dec. 31, 

2012, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved 

in April 2011, we may issue 32,994,545 new options. 

Of this amount, 20,144,378 shares (subject to 

potential increase as provided in the Long-Term 

Incentive Plan) may be issued as restricted stock or 

RSUs. Stock-based compensation expense related to 

retirement eligibility vesting totaled $64 million in 

2012, $31 million in 2011 and $25 million in 2010. 
Stock options 

Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the 
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the 

date of grant to officers and employees of BNY 

Mellon. Generally, each option granted is exercisable 

between one and ten years from the date of grant. 
The compensation cost that has been charged against 
income was $70 million for 2012, $96 million for 

2011 and $87 million for 2010. The total income tax 

benefit recognized in the income statement was $29 

million for 2012, $40 million for 2011 and $35 

million for 2010. 
We used a lattice-based binomial method to calculate 

the fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of 

each option award is estimated on the date of grant 

using the weighted-average assumptions noted in the 

following table: 
Assumptions 2012 2011 2010 Dividend yield 3.0% 2.2% 2.2% Expected volatility 
34 32 32 Risk-free interest rate 
1.38 2.75 2.94 Expected option lives (in years) 
6.9 6.7 6.6 For 2012, 2011 and 2010, assumptions were 

determined as follows: 
Š Expected volatilities are based on implied 

volatilities from traded options on our stock, 

historical volatility of our stock, and other 

factors. Š We use historical data to estimate option 

exercises and employee terminations within the 

valuation model. 
Š The risk-free rate for periods within the 

contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. 

Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. 
Š The expected term of options granted is derived 

from the output of the option valuation model 

and represents the period of time that options 

granted are expected to be outstanding.

The weighted-average fair value of options at grant

2010. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was 
$8 million in 2012, $7 million in 2011 and $12 million 

in 2010. 
As of Dec. 31, 2012, $92 million of total 
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested 

options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-

average period of 1.5 years. 
Cash received from option exercises totaled 
$40 million in 2012, $18 million in 2011 and 

$31 million in 2010. The actual tax benefit realized 

for the tax deductions from options exercised totaled 

less than $1 million in 2012, $2 million in 2011 and 

$1 million in 2010. 
Restricted stock and RSUs 

Restricted stock and RSUs are granted under our long=
term incentive plans at no cost to the recipient. These 

awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 

restrictions have lapsed, including continued 

employment, for a specified period. The recipient of a 

share of restricted stock is entitled to voting rights and 

generally is entitled to dividends on the common 

stock. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a share 

of common stock after the applicable restrictions 

lapse. The recipient generally is entitled to receive 

cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the 

underlying common stock during the period the RSU 

is outstanding but does not receive voting rights. 
The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is equal to 

the fair market value of our common stock on the date 

of grant. The expense is recognized over the vesting 

period, which is generally three years. The total 

compensation expense recognized for restricted stock 

and RSUs was $185 million in 2012, $134 million in 

2011 and $119 million in 2010. The total income tax 

benefit recognized in the income statement was 

$76 million for 2012, $52 million for 2011 and 

$46 million for 2010. 
BNY Mellon’s Executive Committee members were 
granted 817,698 RSUs in 2011 which contained 

certain performance criteria that were achieved in 

2011. The actual number of units that will ultimately 

vest is subject to negative discretion by BNY 

Mellon’s Human Resources Compensation Committee 

and as a result, are subject to variable accounting.

restricted stock and RSU activity for 2012.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) The total fair value of restricted stock and RSUs that 
vested was $84 million in 2012, $100 million in 2011 

and $96 million in 2010. 
Subsidiary Long-Term Incentive plans 

BNY Mellon also has several subsidiary Long-Term 
Incentive Plans which have issued restricted 

subsidiary shares to certain employees. These share 

awards are subject to forfeiture until certain 

restrictions have lapsed, including continued 

employment for a specified period of time. The shares 

are non-voting and non-dividend paying. Once the 

restrictions lapse, which generally occurs in three to 

five years, the shares can only be sold, at the option of 

the employee, to BNY Mellon at a price based 

generally on the fair value of the subsidiary at the time 
of repurchase. In certain instances BNY Mellon has 

an election to call the shares. 
Note 19—Employee benefit plans BNY Mellon has defined benefit and/or defined 
contribution retirement plans covering substantially 

all full-time and eligible part-time employees and 

other post-retirement plans providing healthcare 

benefits for certain retired employees.

“Critical accounting estimates” section. 
Assumed healthcare cost trend—Domestic post-
retirement healthcare benefits 
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in 
determining benefit expense for 2013 is 7.50% 

decreasing to 4.75% in 2022. This projection is based 

on various economic models that forecast a decreasing 

growth rate of healthcare expenses over time. The 

underlying assumption is that healthcare expense 

growth cannot outpace gross national product 

(“GNP”) growth indefinitely, and over time a lower 

equilibrium growth rate will be achieved. Further, the 

growth rate assumed in 2022 bears a reasonable 

relationship to the discount rate. 
An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one 
percentage point for each year would increase the 

accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by $14 

million, or 8%, and the sum of the service and interest 

costs by $1 million, or 8%. Conversely, a decrease in 

this rate of one percentage point for each year would 

decrease the benefit obligation by $12 million, or 7%, 

and the sum of the service and interest costs by $1 

million, or 7%. 
Assumed healthcare cost trend—Foreign post-
retirement healthcare benefits 
An increase in the healthcare cost trend rate of one 
percentage point for each year would increase the 

accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by less 

than $1 million and the sum of the service and interest 

costs by less than $1 million. Conversely, a decrease 

in this rate of one percentage point for each year 

would decrease the benefit obligation by less than $1 

million and the sum of the service and interest costs 

by less than $1 million.

Investment strategy and asset allocation BNY Mellon is responsible for the administration of 
various employee pension and healthcare post-

retirement benefits plans, both domestically and 

internationally. The domestic plans are administered 

by BNY Mellon’s Benefits Administration 

Committee, a named fiduciary. Subject to the 

following, at all relevant times, BNY Mellon’s 

Benefits Investment Committee, another named 

fiduciary to the domestic plans, is responsible for the 

investment of plan assets. The Benefits Investment 

Committee’s responsibilities include the investment of 

all domestic defined benefit plan assets, as well as the 

determination of investment options offered to 

participants in all domestic defined contribution plans. 

The Benefits Investment Committee conducts periodic 

reviews of investment performance, asset allocation 

and investment manager suitability. In addition, the 

Benefits Investment Committee has oversight of the 
164 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Regional Governance Committees for the foreign 
defined benefit plans. 
Our investment objective for U.S. and foreign plans is 
to maximize total return while maintaining a broadly 

diversified portfolio for the primary purpose of 

satisfying obligations for future benefit payments. 
Equities are the main holding of the plans. Alternative 
investments (including private equities) and fixed 

income securities provide diversification and, in 

certain cases, lower the volatility of returns. In 

general, equity securities and alternative investments 

within any domestic plan’s portfolio can be 

maintained in the range of 30% to 70% of total plan 

assets, fixed-income securities can range from 20% to 

50% of plan assets and cash equivalents can be held in 

amounts ranging from 0% to 5% of plan assets. Actual 

asset allocation within the approved ranges varies 

from time to time based on economic conditions (both 

current and forecast) and the advice of professional 

advisors. Our pension assets were invested as follows at Dec. 
31, 2012 and 2011:

31, 2012. We held no The Bank of New York Mellon 
Corporation stock in our pension plans at Dec. 31, 

2011 and 2012. Assets of the U.S. post-retirement 

healthcare plan are invested in an insurance contract. 
Fair value measurement of plan assets In accordance with ASC 715, BNY Mellon has 
established a three-level hierarchy for fair value 

measurements of its pension plan assets based upon 

the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset 

as of the measurement date. The valuation hierarchy is 

consistent with guidance in ASC 820 which is detailed 

in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. The following is a description of the valuation 

methodologies used for assets measured at fair value, 

as well as the general classification of such assets 

pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
Cash and currency 
This category consists primarily of foreign currency 
balances and is included in Level 1 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Foreign currency is translated monthly 

based on current exchange rates. 
Common and preferred stock, exchange traded funds 
and equity funds 
These investments include equities, exchange traded 
funds and equity funds and are valued at the closing 

price reported in the active market in which the 

individual securities are traded, if available. Where 

there are no readily available market quotations, we 

determine fair value primarily based on pricing 

sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. 
Venture capital investments and partnership interests 
There are no readily available market quotations for 
these funds. The fair value of the investments is based 

on the pension plan’s ownership percentage of the fair 

value of the underlying funds as provided by the fund 

managers. These funds are typically valued on a 

quarterly basis. The pension plan’s venture capital 

investments and partnership interests are valued at 

NAV as a practical expedient for fair value and 

classified as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Collective trust funds 
Collective trust funds include commingled and U.S. 
equity funds that have no readily available market 

quotations. The fair value of the funds are based on 

the securities in the portfolio, which typically are the 

amount that the fund might reasonably expect to 

receive for the securities upon a sale. These funds are 

valued using observable inputs on either a daily or 

monthly basis. Collective trust funds are included as 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Fixed income investments 
Fixed income investments include U.S. Treasury 
securities, U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 

government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 

foreign corporate debt funds. U.S. Treasury securities 
BNY Mellon 165 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) are valued at the closing price reported in the active 
market in which the individual security is traded and 

included as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. 

Government agencies, sovereign government 

obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and foreign 

corporate debt funds are valued based on quoted 

prices for comparable securities with similar yields 

and credit ratings. When quoted prices are not 

available for identical or similar bonds, the bonds are 

valued using discounted cash flows that maximize 

observable inputs, such as current yields of similar 

instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks 

that may not be observable, such as credit and 

liquidity risks. U.S. Government agencies, sovereign 

government obligations, U.S. corporate bonds and 

foreign corporate debt funds are primarily included as 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy with a small portion 

of foreign corporate debt funds included as Level 3. 
Funds of funds 
There are no readily available market quotations for 
these funds. The fair value of the fund is based on 

NAVs of the funds in the portfolio, which reflects the 

value of the underlying securities. The fair value of 

the underlying securities is typically the amount that 

the fund might reasonably expect to receive upon 

selling those hard to value or illiquid securities within 

the portfolios. These funds are valued using 

unobservable inputs on a monthly basis and are 

included as Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the fair value of each 

major category of plan assets as of Dec. 31, 2012 and 

Dec. 31, 2011, by captions and by ASC 820 valuation 

hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1 

and Level 2.

Defined contribution plans We have an Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
(“ESOP”) covering certain domestic full-time 

employees with more than one year of service. The 

ESOP works in conjunction with the defined benefit 

pension plan. Employees are entitled to the higher of 

their benefit under the ESOP or such defined benefit 

pension plan at retirement. Benefits payable under the 

defined benefit pension plan are offset by the 

equivalent value of benefits earned under the ESOP. 
At Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, the ESOP owned 
6.9 million and 7.1 million shares of our stock, 

respectively. The fair value of total ESOP assets was 

$181 million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $146 million at 

Dec. 31, 2011. Contributions are made equal to 

required principal and interest payments on 

borrowings by the ESOP. There were no contributions 

and no ESOP related expense in 2012, 2011 or 2010. 
We have defined contribution plans, excluding the 
ESOP, for which we recognized a cost of $180 million 

in 2012, $182 million in 2011 and $163 million in 

2010. The Benefits Investment Committee appointed 
Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. to serve as the independent 

fiduciary to (i) make certain fiduciary decisions 

related to the continued prudence of offering the 

common stock of BNY Mellon or its affiliates as an 

investment option under the plans other than with 
168 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) respect to plan sponsor decisions, and (ii) select and 
monitor any managed investments (active or passive, 

including mutual funds) of BNY Mellon or its 

affiliates to be offered to participants as investment 

options under the Plan. 
Note 20—Company financial information Our bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend 
limitations under the Federal Reserve Act, as well as 

national and state banking laws. Under these statutes, 

prior regulatory consent is required for dividends in 

any year that would exceed the bank’s net profits for 

such year combined with retained net profits for the 

prior two years. Additionally, such bank subsidiaries 

may not declare dividends in excess of net profits on 

hand, as defined, after deducting the amount by which 

the principal amount of all loans, on which interest is 

past due for a period of six months or more, exceeds 

the allowance for credit losses. 
The payment of dividends also is limited by minimum 
capital requirements imposed on banks. As of Dec. 

31, 2012, BNY Mellon’s bank subsidiaries exceeded 

these minimum requirements. 
Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2012, our bank subsidiaries 
could declare dividends to the Parent of 

approximately $2.7 billion without the need for a 

regulatory waiver. Including the impact of the 

approximately $850 million charge related to the Feb. 

11, 2013 U.S. Tax Court ruling, dividend paying 

capacity at our bank subsidiaries would decrease to 

$1.9 billion. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2012, non-bank 

subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of 

approximately $1.4 billion. The bank subsidiaries declared dividends of $679 
million in 2012, $156 million in 2011, $239 million in 

2010. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have 

issued additional guidelines that require bank holding 

companies and national banks to continually evaluate 

the level of cash dividends in relation to their 

respective operating income, capital needs, asset 

quality and overall financial condition. 
The Federal Reserve Board policy with respect to the 
payment of cash dividends by bank holding 

companies provides that, as a matter of prudent 

banking, a bank holding company should not maintain 

a rate of cash dividends unless its net income 

available to common shareholders has been sufficient 

to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of 

earnings retention appears to be consistent with the 
holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and 

overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve 

Board can also prohibit a dividend if payment would 

constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Any 

increase in BNY Mellon’s ongoing quarterly 

dividends would require approval from the Federal 

Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s current guidance 

provides that, for large bank holding companies like 

us, dividend payout ratios exceeding 30% of projected 

after-tax net income will receive particularly close 

scrutiny. On Nov. 22, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final 
rule requiring U.S. bank holding companies with total 

consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, like BNY 

Mellon, to submit annual capital plans for review. The 

Federal Reserve will evaluate the bank holding 

companies’ capital adequacy, internal capital 

adequacy assessment processes, and their plans to 

make capital distributions, such as dividend payments 

or stock repurchases. 
BNY Mellon and other affected BHCs may pay 
dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital 

distributions only in accordance with a capital plan 

that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as 

to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The 

Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if the 

plan does not show that the covered BHC will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio 

of Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted 

assets of at least 5% on a 
pro forma 
basis under 
expected and stressful conditions throughout the nine-

quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan. 

The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered 

BHC may not make a capital distribution unless after 

giving effect to the distribution it will meet all 

minimum regulatory capital ratios and have a ratio of 

Basel I Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets 

of at least 5%. As part of this process, BNY Mellon 

also provides the Federal Reserve with estimates of 

the composition and levels of regulatory capital, risk-

weighted assets and other measures under Basel III 

under an identified scenario. BNY Mellon’s most 

recent capital plan was submitted to the Federal 

Reserve on Jan. 7, 2013. 
The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to 
publish its objection or non-objection to the capital 

plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend 

payments and share repurchases, no later than 

March 14, 2013. 
The Federal Reserve Act limits and requires collateral 
for extensions of credit by our insured subsidiary 
BNY Mellon 169 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) banks to BNY Mellon and certain of its non-bank 
affiliates. Also, there are restrictions on the amounts 

of investments by such banks in stock and other 

securities of BNY Mellon and such affiliates, and 

restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as 

collateral for loans by such banks. Extensions of 

credit by the banks to each of our affiliates are limited 

to 10% of such bank’s regulatory capital, and in the 

aggregate for BNY Mellon and all such affiliates to 

20%, and collateral must be between 100% and 130% 

of the amount of the credit, depending on the type of 

collateral. Our insured subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks under 

the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D. Required 

balances averaged $5.4 billion and $4.3 billion for the 

years 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
In the event of impairment of the capital stock of one 
of the Parent’s national banks or The Bank of New 

York Mellon, the Parent, as the banks’ stockholder, 

could be required to pay such deficiency. 
The Parent guarantees the debt issued by Mellon 
Funding Corporation, a wholly-owned financing 

subsidiary of the Company. The Parent also 

guarantees committed and uncommitted lines of credit 

of Pershing LLC and Pershing Limited subsidiaries. 

The Parent guarantees described above are full and 

unconditional and contain the standard provisions 

relating to parent guarantees of subsidiary debt. 

Additionally, the Parent guarantees or indemnifies 

obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries as needed. 

Generally there are no stated notional amounts 

included in these indemnifications and the 

contingencies triggering the obligation for 

indemnification are not expected to occur. As a result, 

we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum 

payout under these indemnifications. However, we 
believe the possibility is remote that we will have to 

make any material payment under these guarantees 

and indemnifications.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Note 21—Fair value measurement The guidance related to “Fair Value Measurement” 
included in ASC 820 defines fair value as the price 

that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to 

transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between 

market participants at the measurement date and 

establishes a framework for measuring fair value. It 

establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value 

measurements based upon the transparency of inputs 

to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the 

measurement date and expands the disclosures about 

instruments measured at fair value. ASC 820 requires 

consideration of a company’s own creditworthiness 

when valuing liabilities. 
The standard provides a consistent definition of fair 
value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly 

transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or 

distressed sale) between market participants at the 

measurement date under current market conditions. If 

there has been a significant decrease in the volume 

and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change 

in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation 

techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, 

determining the price at which willing market 

participants would transact at the measurement date 

under current market conditions depends on the facts 

and circumstances and requires the use of significant 

judgment. The objective is to determine from 

weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point 

within the range that is most representative of fair 

value under current market conditions. 
Determination of fair value 

Following is a description of our valuation 
methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at 

fair value. We have established processes for 

determining fair values. Fair value is based upon 

quoted market prices in active markets, where 

available. For financial instruments where quotes 

from recent exchange transactions are not available, 

we determine fair value based on discounted cash 

flow analysis, comparison to similar instruments, and 

the use of financial models. Discounted cash flow 

analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash 

flows and the level of interest rates. Model-based 

pricing uses inputs of observable prices, where 

available, for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, 

option volatilities and other factors. Models are 

benchmarked and validated by an independent internal 

risk management function. Our valuation process 
takes into consideration factors such as counterparty 

credit quality, liquidity, concentration concerns, and 

observability of model parameters. Valuation 

adjustments may be made to ensure that financial 

instruments are recorded at fair value. 
Most derivative contracts are valued using internally 
developed models which are calibrated to observable 

market data and employ standard market pricing 

theory for their valuations. An initial “risk-neutral” 

valuation is performed on each position assuming 

time-discounting based on a AA credit curve. Then, to 

arrive at a fair value that incorporates counter-party 

credit risk, a credit adjustment is made to these results 

by discounting each trade’s expected exposures to the 

counterparty using the counterparty’s credit spreads, 

as implied by the credit default swap market. We also 

adjust expected liabilities to the counterparty using 

BNY Mellon’s own credit spreads, as implied by the 

credit default swap market. Accordingly, the valuation 

of our derivative position is sensitive to the current 

changes in our own credit spreads as well as those of 

our counterparties. 
In certain cases, recent prices may not be observable 
for instruments that trade in inactive or less active 

markets. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing 

financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we 

make an adjustment to their value. The determination 

of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of 

external quotes, the time since the latest available 

quote and the price volatility of the instrument. 
Certain parameters in some financial models are not 
directly observable and, therefore, are based on 

management’s estimates and judgments. These 

financial instruments are normally traded less 

actively. We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate 

the possibility of error and revision in the model based 

estimate value. Examples include products where 

parameters such as correlation and recovery rates are 

unobservable. The methods described above for instruments that 
trade in inactive or less active markets may produce a 

current fair value calculation that may not be 

indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future 

fair values. We believe our methods of determining 

fair value are appropriate and consistent with other 

market participants. However, the use of different 

methodologies or different assumptions to value 

certain financial instruments could result in a different 

estimate of fair value. 
172 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Valuation hierarchy ASC 820 established a three-level valuation hierarchy 
for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon 

the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset 

or liability as of the measurement date. The three 

levels are described below. 
Level 1
: Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
recent quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets 

or liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and 

liabilities include debt and equity securities and 

derivative financial instruments actively traded on 

exchanges and U.S. Treasury securities that are 

actively traded in highly liquid over-the-counter 

markets. Level 2
: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, 
for example, quoted prices for similar assets and 

liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical 

or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not 

active, and inputs that are observable or can be 

corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for 

substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments 

that are traded less frequently than exchange traded 

securities and derivative instruments whose model 

inputs are observable in the market or can be 

corroborated by market observable data. Examples in 

this category are certain variable and fixed rate agency 

and non-agency securities, corporate debt securities 

and derivative contracts. 
Level 3
: Inputs to the valuation methodology are 
unobservable and significant to the fair value 

measurement. Examples in this category include 

interests in certain securitized financial assets, certain 

private equity investments, and derivative contracts 

that are highly structured or long-dated. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the 
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of 

input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
Following is a description of the valuation 
methodologies used for instruments measured at fair 

value, as well as the general classification of such 

instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
Securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, 
we classify the securities within Level 1 of the 

valuation hierarchy. Securities include both long and 
short positions. Level 1 securities include highly 

liquid government bonds, money market mutual funds 

and exchange-traded equities. 
If quoted market prices are not available, we estimate 
fair values using pricing models, quoted prices of 

securities with similar characteristics or discounted 

cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which 

would generally be classified within Level 2 of the 

valuation hierarchy, include certain agency and non-

agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial 

mortgage-backed securities, sovereign debt, corporate 

bonds and foreign covered bonds. 
For securities where quotes from recent transactions 
are not available for identical securities, we determine 

fair value primarily based on pricing sources with 

reasonable levels of price transparency that employ 

financial models or obtain comparison to similar 

instruments to arrive at “consensus” prices. 
Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent 
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g., 

vintage, position in the securitization structure) and 

ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of 

prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 

such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 

marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2. 

Pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific 

security whenever they determine there is insufficient 

observable data to provide a good faith opinion on 

price. In addition, we have significant investments in more 
actively traded agency RMBS and other types of 

securities such as sovereign debt. The pricing sources 

derive the prices for these securities largely from 

quotes they obtain from three major inter-dealer 

brokers. The pricing sources receive their daily 

observed trade price and other information feeds from 

the inter-dealer brokers. 
For securities with bond insurance, the financial 
strength of the insurance provider is analyzed and that 

information is included in the fair value assessment 

for such securities. 
In certain cases where there is limited activity or less 
transparency around inputs to the valuation, we 

classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Securities classified within Level 3 

primarily include other debt securities and securities 

of state and political subdivisions. 
BNY Mellon 173 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) At Dec. 31, 2012, more than 99% of our securities 
were valued by pricing sources with reasonable levels 

of price transparency. Less than 1% of our securities 

were priced based on economic models and non-

binding dealer quotes, and are included in Level 3 of 

the ASC 820 hierarchy. 
Consolidated collateralized loan obligations 
BNY Mellon values assets in consolidated CLOs 
using observable market prices observed from the 

secondary loan market. The returns to the note holders 

are solely dependent on the assets and accordingly 

equal the value of those assets. Based on the structure 

of the CLOs, the valuation of the assets is attributable 

to the senior note holders. Changes in the values of 

assets and liabilities are reflected in the income 

statement as investment income and interest of 

investment management fund note holders, 

respectively. Derivatives 
We classify exchange-traded derivatives valued using 
quoted prices in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Examples include exchanged-traded equity and 

foreign exchange options. Since few other classes of 

derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, most of 

our derivative positions are valued using internally 

developed models that use as their basis readily 

observable market parameters and we classify them in 

Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives 

include basic swaps and options and credit default 

swaps. Derivatives valued using models with significant 
unobservable market parameters in markets that lack 

two-way flow are classified in Level 3 of the 

valuation hierarchy. Examples include long-dated 

interest rate or currency swaps and options, where 

parameters may be unobservable for longer maturities; 

and certain products, where correlation risk is 

unobservable. The fair value of these derivatives 

compose less than 1% of our derivative financial 

instruments. Additional disclosures of derivative 

instruments are provided in Note 24 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments 

Where quoted market prices are not available, we 
generally base the fair value of loans and unfunded 

lending-related commitments on observable market 

prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit 

derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If 
observable market prices are not available, we base 

the fair value on estimated cash flows adjusted for 

credit risk which are discounted using an interest rate 

appropriate for the maturity of the applicable loans or 

the unfunded lending-related commitments. 
Unrealized gains and losses, if any, on unfunded 
lending-related commitments carried at fair value are 

classified in Other assets and Other liabilities, 

respectively. Loans and unfunded lending-related 

commitments carried at fair value are generally 

classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Seed capital 

In our Investment Management business we manage 
investment assets, including equities, fixed income, 

money market and alternative investment funds for 

institutions and other investors; as part of that activity 

we make seed capital investments in certain funds. 

Seed capital is included in other assets. When 

applicable, we value seed capital based on the 

published NAV of the fund. We include funds in 

which ownership interests in the fund are publicly 

traded in an active market and institutional funds in 

which investors trade in and out daily in Level 1 of 

the valuation hierarchy. We include open-end funds 

where investors are allowed to sell their ownership 

interest back to the fund less frequently than daily and 

where our interest in the fund contains no other rights 

or obligations in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 

However, we generally include investments in funds 

that allow investors to sell their ownership interest 

back to the fund less frequently than monthly in 

Level 3, unless actual redemption prices are 

observable. For other types of investments in funds, we consider 
all of the rights and obligations inherent in our 

ownership interest, including the reported NAV as 

well as other factors that affect the fair value of our 

interest in the fund. To the extent the NAV 

measurements reported for the investments are based 

on unobservable inputs or include other rights and 

obligations (e.g., obligation to meet cash calls), we 

generally classify them in Level 3 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Certain interests in securitizations 

For certain interests in securitizations which are 
classified in securities available-for-sale, trading 

assets and long-term debt, we use discounted cash 

flow models which generally include assumptions of 
174 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) projected finance charges related to the securitized 
assets, estimated net credit losses, prepayment 

assumptions and estimates of payments to third-party 

investors. When available, we compare our fair value 

estimates and assumptions to market activity and to 

the actual results of the securitized portfolio. 
Private equity investments 

Our Other segment includes holdings of nonpublic 
private equity investment through funds managed by 

third-party investment managers. We value private 

equity investments initially based upon the transaction 

price, which we subsequently adjust to reflect 

expected exit values as evidenced by financing and 

sale transactions with third parties or through ongoing 

reviews by the investment managers. 
Private equity investments also include publicly held 
equity investments, generally obtained through the 

initial public offering of privately held equity 

investments. These equity investments are often held 

in a partnership structure. Publicly held investments 
are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less 

adjustments for regulatory or contractual sales 

restrictions or adjustments to reflect the difficulty in 

selling a partnership interest. 
Discounts for restrictions are quantified by analyzing 
the length of the restriction period and the volatility of 

the equity security. Publicly held private equity 

investments are primarily classified in Level 2 of the 

valuation hierarchy. 
The following tables present the financial instruments 
carried at fair value at Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011, by 

caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by 

ASC 820 valuation hierarchy (as described above). 

We have included credit ratings information in certain 

of the tables because the information indicates the 

degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, and 

significant changes in ratings classifications could 

result in increased risk for us. There were no material 

transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2012.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements 
Our classification of a financial instrument in Level 3 
of the valuation hierarchy is based on the significance 

of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value 

measurement. However, these instruments generally 

include other observable components that are actively 

quoted or validated to third-party sources; 

accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below 

include changes in fair value due to observable 

parameters as well as the unobservable parameters in 

our valuation methodologies. We also frequently 

manage the risks of Level 3 financial instruments 

using securities and derivatives positions that are 
Level 1 or 2 instruments which are not included in the 

table; accordingly, the gains or losses below do not 

reflect the effect of our risk management activities 

related to the Level 3 instruments. 
The Company has a Level 3 Pricing Committee which 
validates the valuation techniques used in determining 

the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities. 
The tables below include a roll forward of the balance 
sheet amounts for the years ended Dec. 31, 2012 and 

2011 (including the change in fair value), for financial

related commitments although they are not measured 

at fair value on an ongoing basis. An example would 

be the recording of an impairment of an asset. 
The following table presents the financial instruments 

carried on the consolidated balance sheet by caption 

and by level in the fair value hierarchy as of Dec. 31,

Estimated fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying amounts of our financial instruments 
(i.e., monetary assets and liabilities) are determined 

under different accounting methods—see Note 1 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The 

following disclosure discusses these instruments on a 

uniform fair value basis. However, active markets do 

not exist for a significant portion of these instruments. 
For financial instruments where quoted prices from 

identical assets and liabilities in active markets do not 

exist, we determine fair value based on discounted 

cash flow analysis and comparison to similar 

instruments. Discounted cash flow analysis is 

dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the 

level of interest rates. Other judgments would result in 

different fair values. The assumptions we used at 

Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011 include discount 
182 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) rates ranging principally from 0.01% to 4.86%. The 
fair value information supplements the basic financial 

statements and other traditional financial data 

presented throughout this report. 
A summary of the practices used for determining fair 
value and the respective level in the valuation 

hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities not 

recorded at fair value is as follows. 
Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve 
and other central banks and interest-bearing deposits 

with banks The estimated fair value of interest-bearing deposits 
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks is 

equal to the book value as these interest-bearing 

deposits are generally considered cash equivalents. 

These instruments are classified as Level 2 within the 

valuation hierarchy. The estimated fair value of 

interest-bearing deposits with banks is generally 

determined using discounted cash flows and duration 

of the instrument to maturity. The primary inputs used 

to value these transactions are interest rates based on 

current LIBOR market rates and time to maturity. 

Interest-bearing deposits with banks are classified as 

Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds sold and 
securities purchased under resale agreements is based 

on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. Federal 

funds sold and securities purchased under resale 

agreements are classified as Level 2 within the 

valuation hierarchy. 
Securities held-to-maturity 

Where quoted prices are available in an active market 
for identical assets and liabilities, we classify the 

securities as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. 

Securities are defined as both long and short positions. 

Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. 
If quoted market prices are not available for identical 
assets and liabilities, we estimate fair value using 

pricing models, quoted prices of securities with 

similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. 

Examples of such instruments, which would generally 

be classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy, 

include certain agency and non-agency mortgage-

backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed 

securities and state and political subdivision 
securities. For securities where quotes from active 

markets are not available for identical securities, we 

determine fair value primarily based on pricing 

sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 

that employ financial models or obtain comparison to 

similar instruments to arrive at “consensus” prices. 
Specifically, the pricing sources obtain active market 
prices for similar types of securities (e.g., vintage, 

position in the securitization structure) and ascertain 

variables such as discount rate and speed of 

prepayment for the types of transaction and apply 

such variables to similar types of bonds. We view 

these as observable transactions in the current 

marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2 

within the valuation hierarchy. 
Loans 
For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated 
using discounted cash flow analysis, adjusting where 

appropriate for prepayment estimates, using interest 

rates currently being offered for loans with similar 

terms and maturities to borrowers. The estimated fair 

value of margin loans and overdrafts is equal to the 

book value due to the short-term nature of these 

assets. The estimated fair value of other types of loans 

is determined using discounted cash flows. Inputs 

include current LIBOR market rates adjusted for 

credit spreads. These loans are generally classified as 

Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
Other financial assets 

Other financial assets include cash, the Federal 
Reserve Bank stock and accrued interest receivable. 

Cash is classified as Level 1 within the valuation 

hierarchy. The Federal Reserve Bank stock is not 

redeemable or transferable. The estimated fair value 

of the Federal Reserve Bank stock is based on the 

issue price and is classified as Level 2 within the 

valuation hierarchy. Accrued interest receivable is 

generally short-term. As a result, book value is 

considered to equal fair value. Accrued interest 

receivable is included as Level 2 within the valuation 

hierarchy. Noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits 

Interest-bearing deposits are comprised of money 
market rate and demand deposits, savings deposits and 

time deposits. Except for time deposits, book value is 

considered to equal fair value for these deposits due to 

their short duration to maturity or payable on demand 

feature. The fair value of interest-bearing time 
BNY Mellon 183 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) deposits is determined using discounted cash flow 
analysis. Inputs primarily consist of current LIBOR 

market rates and time to maturity. For all noninterest=

bearing deposits, book value is considered to equal 

fair value as a result of the short duration of the 

deposit. Interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing 

deposits are classified as Level 2 within the valuation 

hierarchy. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 
repurchase agreements 
The estimated fair value of federal funds purchased 
and securities sold under repurchase agreements is 

based on inputs such as interest rates and tenors. 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under 

repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 within 

the valuation hierarchy. 
Payables to customers and broker-dealers 

The estimated fair value of payables to customers and 
broker-dealers is equal to the book value due to 

demand feature of the payables to customers and 

broker-dealers and are classified as Level 2 within the 

valuation hierarchy. 
Borrowings Borrowings primarily consist of overdrafts of 
subcustodian account balances in our Investment 

Services businesses, commercial paper and accrued 

interest payable. The estimated fair value of overdrafts 

of subcustodian account balances in our Investment 

Services businesses is considered to equal book value 

as a result of the short duration of the overdrafts. 

Overdrafts are typically repaid within two days. The 

estimated fair value of our commercial paper is based 

on discount and duration of the commercial paper. 

Our commercial paper matures within 397 days from 

date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity 

or subject to voluntary prepayment. Our commercial 

paper is included in Level 2 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Accrued interest payable is generally short-

term. As a result, book value is considered to equal 

fair value. Accrued interest payable is included as 

Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. 
Long-term debt 

The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based on 
current rates for instruments of the same remaining 

maturity or quoted market prices for the same or 

similar issues. Long-term debt is classified as Level 2 

within the valuation hierarchy.

of long-term debt in connection with ASC 810. At 

Dec. 31, 2012, the fair value of this long-term debt 

was $345 million. The long-term debt is valued using

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are 
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk 

management products, commercial lending 

commitments, letters of credit, securities lending 

indemnifications and support agreements. We assume 

these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign currency 

risks, to provide customers with the ability to meet 

credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign 

currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, 

to varying degrees, credit, foreign exchange and 

interest rate risk not recognized in the balance sheet. 

Our off-balance sheet risks are managed and 

monitored in manners similar to those used for on-

and $326 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 
(b)< Net of participations totaling $1.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2012 

and $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. 
Included in lending commitments are facilities that 
provide liquidity for variable rate tax-exempt 

securities wrapped by monoline insurers. The credit 

approval for these facilities is based on an assessment 

of the underlying tax-exempt issuer and considers 

factors other than the financial strength of the 

monoline insurer. 
The total potential loss on undrawn lending 

commitments, standby and commercial letters of 

credit, and securities lending indemnifications is equal 

to the total notional amount if drawn upon, which 

does not consider the value of any collateral. 
Since many of the commitments are expected to 
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount 

does not necessarily represent future cash 

requirements. A summary of lending commitment 

maturities is as follows: $9.0 billion in less than one 

year, $22.2 billion in one to five years and $0.1 billion 

over five years. 
Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) principally support 
corporate obligations. As shown in the off-balance 

sheet credit risks table, the maximum potential 

exposure of SBLCs was $7.2 billion at Dec 31, 2012 

and $6.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, and includes $781 

million and $485 million that were collateralized with 

cash and securities at Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011, 

respectively. At Dec. 31, 2012, $4.1 billion of the 

SBLCs will expire within one year and $3.1 billion in 

one to five years. 
We must recognize, at the inception of standby letters 
of credit and foreign and other guarantees, a liability 

for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in 

issuing the guarantee. As required by ASC 460 
– 
Guarantees, the fair value of the liability, which was 
recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets, 

was estimated as the present value of contractual 

customer fees. 
The estimated liability for losses related to these 
commitments and SBLCs, if any, is included in the 

allowance for lending-related commitments. The 

allowance for lending-related commitments was $121 

million at Dec. 31, 2012 and $103 million at Dec. 31, 

2011. Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored 
using both historical performance and internal ratings 

criteria. BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that 

SBLCs typically expire without being funded. SBLCs 

below investment grade are monitored closely for 

payment/performance risk. The table below shows 

SBLCs by investment grade: 
Standby letters of credit

2012 2011 Investment grade 93% 91% Noninvestment grade 7% 9% 186 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term 
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for 

the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. 

Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent 

upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it 

represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on 

the underlying transaction. As a result, the total 

contractual amounts do not necessarily represent 

future cash requirements. Commercial letters of credit 

totaled $219 million at Dec. 31, 2012 compared with 

$437 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 
A securities lending transaction is a fully 
collateralized transaction in which the owner of a 

security agrees to lend the security (typically through 

an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon), 

to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an 

open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a 

prearranged contract, which normally matures in less 

than 90 days. 
We typically lend securities with indemnification 
against borrower default. We generally require the 

borrower to provide cash collateral with a value of 

102% of the fair value of the securities borrowed, 

which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing 

credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities 

lending transactions. These risks are controlled 

through policies limiting the level of risk that can be 

undertaken. Securities lending transactions are 

generally entered into only with highly rated 

counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications 

were secured by collateral of $253 billion at Dec. 31, 

2012 and $276 billion at Dec. 31, 2011. We recorded 

$198 million of fee revenue from securities lending 

transactions in 2012 compared with $183 million in 

2011. We expect many of these guarantees to expire without 
the need to advance any cash. The revenue associated 

with guarantees frequently depends on the credit 

rating of the obligor and the structure of the 

transaction, including collateral, if any. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, BNY Mellon had no exposure to 
support agreements in excess of the reserve. This 

compares with $63 million at Dec. 31, 2011. 
Operating leases 

Net rent expense for premises and equipment was 
$313 million in 2012, $350 million in 2011 and $314 

million in 2010. 
At Dec. 31, 2012, we were obligated under various 

noncancelable lease agreements, some of which 

provide for additional rents based upon real estate 

taxes, insurance and maintenance and for various 

renewal options. A summary of the future minimum 

rental commitments under noncancelable operating 

leases, net of related sublease revenue, is as follows: 

2013—$286 million; 2014—$250 million; 2015— 

$219 million; 2016—$203 million; 2017—$188 

million; and 2018 and thereafter—$744 million. 
Indemnification Arrangements 

In connection with certain offshore tax exempt funds, 
that we manage in the UK, we may be liable to 

indemnify the funds for income tax payments the 

funds may be required to make in the UK. Her 

Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HRMC”) has 

asserted that some of these funds may be considered 

resident in the UK and liable for income taxes starting 

in 1998. The Company is continuing discussions with 

HMRC regarding the funds. At the present time, we 

do not believe any indemnity payments related to the 

funds are probable or estimable. 
We have provided standard representations for 
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture 

agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and 

other similar types of arrangements and customary 

indemnification for claims and legal proceedings 

related to providing financial services that are not 

otherwise included above. Insurance has been 

purchased to mitigate certain of these risks. Generally, 

there are no stated or notional amounts included in 

these indemnifications and the contingencies 

triggering the obligation for indemnification are not 

expected to occur. Furthermore, often counterparties 

to these transactions provide us with comparable 

indemnifications. We are unable to develop an 

estimate of the maximum payout under these 

indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the 

lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority of 

such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the 

nature of events that would trigger indemnification or 

the level of indemnification for a certain event. We 

believe, however, that the possibility that we will have 

to make any material payments for these 

indemnifications is remote. At Dec. 31, 2012 and 

Dec. 31, 2011, we had no material liabilities under 

these arrangements. 
BNY Mellon 187 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Clearing and Settlement Exchanges 
We are a minority equity investor in, and member of, 
several industry clearing or settlement exchanges 

through which foreign exchange, securities, or other 

transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing 

and settlement exchanges require their members to 

guarantee their obligations and liabilities or to provide 

financial support in the event other members do not 

honor their obligations. We believe the likelihood that 

a clearing or settlement exchange (of which we are a 

member) would become insolvent is remote. 

Additionally, certain settlement exchanges have 

implemented loss allocation policies which enable the 

exchange to allocate settlement losses to the members 

of the exchange. It is not possible to quantify such 

mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs. In addition, 

any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark=

to-market loss cannot be quantified. At Dec. 31, 2012 

and Dec. 31, 2011, we have not recorded any material 

liabilities under these arrangements. 
Legal proceedings 

In the ordinary course of business, BNY Mellon and 
its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in 

or made parties to pending and potential legal actions 

and regulatory matters. Claims for significant 

monetary damages are often asserted in many of these 

legal actions, while claims for disgorgement, penalties 

and/or other remedial sanctions may be sought in 

regulatory matters. It is inherently difficult to predict 

the eventual outcomes of such matters given their 

complexity and the particular facts and circumstances 

at issue in each of these matters. However, on the 

basis of our current knowledge and understanding, we 

do not believe that judgments or settlements, if any, 

arising from these matters (either individually or in 

the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable 

reserves and insurance coverage) will have a material 

adverse effect on the consolidated financial position 

or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could have 

a material effect on net income in a given period. 
In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in 
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where 

(i) the damages sought are substantial or 
indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early 

stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories 

or a large number of parties, as a matter of course 

there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the 

timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and 

regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss, 

fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated 

with each such matter. In accordance with applicable 
accounting guidance, BNY Mellon establishes 

accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when 

those matters proceed to a stage where they present 

loss contingencies that are both probable and 

reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be a 

possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts 

accrued. BNY Mellon will continue to monitor such 

matters for developments that could affect the amount 

of the accrual, and will adjust the accrual amount as 

appropriate. If the loss contingency in question is not 

both probable and reasonably estimable, BNY Mellon 

does not establish an accrual and the matter will 

continue to be monitored for any developments that 

would make the loss contingency both probable and 

reasonably estimable. BNY Mellon believes that its 

accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, in 

the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated 

financial position of BNY Mellon, although future 

accruals could have a material effect on net income in 

a given period. 
For certain of those matters described herein for 
which a loss contingency may, in the future, be 

reasonably possible (whether in excess of a related 

accrued liability or where there is no accrued 

liability), BNY Mellon is currently unable to estimate 

a range of reasonably possible loss. For those matters 

where BNY Mellon is able to estimate a reasonably 

possible loss, exclusive of matters described in Note 

13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 

subject to the accounting and reporting requirements 

of ASC 740 (FASB Interpretation 48), the aggregate 

range of such reasonably possible loss is up to $470 

million in excess of the accrued liability (if any) 

related to those matters. 
The following describes certain judicial, regulatory 
and arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon: 
Sentinel Matters 
As previously disclosed, on Jan. 18, 2008, The Bank 
of New York Mellon filed a proof of claim in the 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding of Sentinel 
Management Group, Inc. (“Sentinel”) pending in 
federal court in the Northern District of Illinois, 
seeking to recover approximately $312 million loaned 
to Sentinel and secured by securities and cash in an 

account maintained by Sentinel at The Bank of 

New York Mellon. On March 3, 2008, the bankruptcy 

trustee filed an adversary complaint against The Bank 

of New York Mellon seeking to disallow The Bank of 

New York Mellon’s claim and seeking damages for 

allegedly aiding and abetting Sentinel insiders in 

misappropriating customer assets and improperly 
188 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) using those assets as collateral for the loan. In a 
decision dated Nov. 3, 2010, the court found for The 

Bank of New York Mellon and against the bankruptcy 

trustee, holding that The Bank of New York Mellon’s 

loan to Sentinel is valid, fully secured and not subject 

to equitable subordination. The bankruptcy trustee 

appealed this decision, and on Aug. 9, 2012, the 

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit 

issued a decision affirming the trial court’s judgment. 

On Sept. 7, 2012, the bankruptcy trustee filed a 

petition for rehearing on the fraudulent transfer 

portion of the opinion and, on Nov. 30, 2012, the 

Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion and vacated its 

judgment. The appeal remains under consideration. 
As previously disclosed, in November 2009, the 
Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Commodities 

Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) indicated that 

it is considering a recommendation to the CFTC that it 

file a civil enforcement action against The Bank of 

New York Mellon for possible violations of the 

Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations in 

connection with its relationship to Sentinel. The Bank 

of New York Mellon responded in writing to the 

CFTC on Jan. 29, 2010 and provided an explanation 

as to why an enforcement action is unwarranted. 
Securities Lending Matters 
As previously disclosed, BNY Mellon or its affiliates 

have been named as defendants in a number of 

lawsuits initiated by participants in BNY Mellon’s 

securities lending program, which is a part of BNY 

Mellon’s Investment Services business. The lawsuits 

were filed on various dates from 2009 to 2012, and 

are currently pending in courts in New York, South 

Carolina and North Carolina and in commercial court 

in London. The complaints assert contractual, 

statutory, and common law claims, including claims 

for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The 

plaintiffs allege losses in connection with the 

investment of securities lending collateral, including 

losses related to investments in Sigma Finance Inc. 

(“Sigma”), Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. and 

certain asset-backed securities, and seek damages as 

to those losses. Two of the pending cases seek to 

proceed as class actions. 
On Oct. 25, 2012, the court entered final approval of a 
previously-announced settlement of the Oklahoma 

class action lawsuit concerning Sigma losses. Under 

the terms of the settlement, The Bank of New York 

Mellon agreed to pay $280 million in exchange for a 

complete release of claims in the class action. 
Matters Relating To Bernard L. Madoff 

As previously disclosed, on May 11, 2010, the New 

York State Attorney General commenced a civil 

lawsuit against Ivy Asset Management LLC (“Ivy”), a 

subsidiary of BNY Mellon that manages primarily 

funds-of-hedge-funds, and two of its former officers 

in New York state court. The lawsuit alleges that Ivy, 

in connection with its role as sub-advisor to 

investment managers whose clients invested with 

Madoff, did not disclose certain material facts about 

Madoff. The complaint seeks an accounting of 

compensation received from January 1997 to the 

present by the Ivy defendants in connection with the 

Madoff investments, and unspecified damages, 

including restitution, disgorgement, costs and 

attorneys’ fees. 
As previously disclosed, on Oct. 21, 2010, the U.S. 
Department of Labor commenced a civil lawsuit 

against Ivy, two of its former officers, and others in 

federal court in the Southern District of New York. 

The lawsuit alleges that Ivy violated the Employee 

Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) by failing 

to disclose certain material facts about Madoff to 

investment managers subadvised by Ivy whose clients 

included employee benefit plan investors. The 

complaint seeks disgorgement and damages. 
As previously disclosed, Ivy or its affiliates have been 
named in a number of civil lawsuits filed beginning 

Jan. 27, 2009 relating to certain investment funds that 

allege losses due to the Madoff investments. Ivy acted 

as a sub-advisor to the investment managers of some 

of those funds. Plaintiffs assert various causes of 

action including securities and common-law fraud. 

Certain of the cases have been certified as class 

actions and/or assert derivative claims on behalf of the 

funds. Most of the cases have been consolidated in 

two actions in federal court in the Southern District of 

New York, with certain cases filed in New York State 

Supreme Court for New York and Nassau counties. 
On Nov. 13, 2012, Ivy entered into a settlement 
agreement with the New York State Attorney General, 

the U.S. Department of Labor, and the civil lawsuit 

plaintiffs that would settle all claims for $210 million. 

The settlement is subject to judicial approval, which 

the various courts have preliminarily given. A hearing 

on final approval is scheduled for March 15, 2013. 
On Dec. 8, 2010, the Trustee overseeing the Madoff 
liquidation sued many of the same defendants in 

bankruptcy court in New York, seeking to avoid 

withdrawals from Madoff investments made by 

various funds-of-funds (including six funds-of-funds 
BNY Mellon 189 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) managed by Ivy). On Oct. 12, 2012, Ivy and the 
Trustee entered into a written settlement agreement, 

agreeing to settle all claims for $2 million. The 

settlement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on 

Dec. 4, 2012. 
Medical Capital Litigations 
As previously disclosed, The Bank of New York 

Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of 

class actions and non-class actions brought by 

numerous plaintiffs in connection with its role as 

indenture trustee for debt issued by affiliates of 

Medical Capital Corporation. The actions, filed in late 

2009 and currently pending in federal court in the 

Central District of California, allege that The Bank of 

New York Mellon breached its fiduciary and 

contractual obligations to the holders of the 

underlying securities, and seek unspecified damages. 

On Dec. 21, 2012, The Bank of New York Mellon 

entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 

and the Federal Equity Receiver for Medical Capital 

Corporation and its affiliates. Under the terms of the 

settlement, The Bank of New York Mellon will make 

a payment of $114 million in exchange for a complete 

release of claims. The settlement is subject to court 

approval. Foreign Exchange Matters 
As previously disclosed, beginning in December 

2009, government authorities have been conducting 

inquiries seeking information relating primarily to 

standing instruction foreign exchange transactions in 

connection with custody services BNY Mellon 

provides to public pension plans and certain other 

custody clients. BNY Mellon is cooperating with 

these inquiries. 
In addition, in early 2011, as previously disclosed, the 
Virginia Attorney General’s Office and the Florida 

Attorney General’s Office each intervened in a 
qui tam lawsuit pending in its jurisdiction, and, on Aug. 

11, 2011, filed superseding complaints. On Nov. 9, 

2012, the Virginia court, which had previously 

dismissed all of the claims against BNY Mellon, 

dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice by agreement of 

the parties. On Oct. 4, 2011, the New York Attorney 

General’s Office, the New York City Comptroller and 

various city pension and benefit funds filed a lawsuit 

asserting, claims under the Martin Act and state and 

city false claims acts. Also, on Oct. 4, 2011, the 

United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a 

civil lawsuit seeking civil penalties under 12 U.S.C. 

Section 1833a and injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C. 

Section 1345 based on alleged ongoing violations of 
18 U.S.C. Sections 1341 and 1343 (mail and wire 

fraud). On Jan. 17, 2012, the court approved a partial 

settlement resolving the DOJ’s claim for injunctive 

relief. In October 2011, several political subdivisions 

of the state of California intervened in a 
qui tam 
lawsuit that was removed to federal district court in 

California. On March 30, 2012, the court dismissed 

certain of plaintiffs’ claims, including all claims under 

the California False Claims Act. Certain plaintiffs 

have since filed an amended complaint. Several 

plaintiffs also had their claims dismissed for improper 

venue and one refiled on Sept. 5, 2012 in a different 

California federal district court. On Oct. 26, 2011, the 

Massachusetts Securities Division filed an 

Administrative Complaint against BNY Mellon. 
BNY Mellon has also been named as a defendant in 
several putative class action federal lawsuits filed on 

various dates in 2011 and 2012. The complaints, 

which assert claims including breach of contract and 

ERISA violations, all allege that the prices BNY 

Mellon charged for standing instruction foreign 

exchange transactions executed in connection with 

custody services provided by BNY Mellon were 

improper. In addition, BNY Mellon has been named 

as a nominal defendant in several derivative lawsuits 

filed 2011 and 2012 in state and federal court in New 

York. BNY Mellon has also been named in a 
qui tam 
lawsuit filed on May 22, 2012 in Massachusetts state 

court. To the extent these lawsuits are pending in 

federal court, they have been consolidated for pre-trial 

purposes in federal court in New York. 
Lyondell Litigation 

As previously disclosed, in an action filed in New 

York State Supreme Court for New York County, on 

Sept. 14, 2010, plaintiffs as holders of debt issued by 

Basell AF in 2005 allege that The Bank of New York 

Mellon, as indenture trustee, breached its contractual 

and fiduciary obligations by executing an intercreditor 

agreement in 2007 in connection with Basell’s 

acquisition of Lyondell Chemical Company. Plaintiffs 

are seeking damages for their alleged losses resulting 

from the execution of the 2007 intercreditor 

agreement that allowed the company to increase the 

amount of its senior debt. 
Tax Litigation 
As previously disclosed, on Aug. 17, 2009, BNY 

Mellon received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency 

disallowing tax benefits for the 2001 and 2002 tax 

years in connection with a 2001 transaction that 

involved the payment of UK corporate income taxes 

that were credited against BNY Mellon’s U.S. 
190 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) corporate income tax liability. On Nov. 10, 2009, 
BNY Mellon filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court 

contesting the disallowance of the benefits. Trial was 

held from April 16 to May 17, 2012. On Feb. 11, 

2013, the Tax Court upheld the IRS’s Notice of 

Deficiency and disallowed BNY Mellon’s tax credits 

and associated transaction costs. BNY Mellon will 

appeal the Tax Court’s ruling. See Note 13 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 

additional information. Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceeding 
As previously disclosed, The Bank of New York 

Mellon as trustee is the petitioner in a legal 

proceeding filed in New York State Supreme Court, 

New York County on June 29, 2011, seeking approval 

of a proposed settlement involving Bank of America 

Corporation and bondholders in certain Countrywide 

residential mortgage-securitization trusts. The New 

York and Delaware Attorneys General have 

intervened in this proceeding. 
Note 24—Derivative instruments We use derivatives to manage exposure to market 
risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency 

risk. Our trading activities are focused on acting as a 

market-maker for our customers and facilitating 

customer trades. In addition, we periodically manage 

positions for our own account. Positions managed for 

our own account are immaterial to our foreign 

exchange and other trading revenue and to our overall 

results of operations. 
The notional amounts for derivative financial 
instruments express the dollar volume of the 

transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller. We 

perform credit reviews and enter into netting 

agreements to minimize the credit risk of derivative 

financial instruments. We enter into offsetting 

positions to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, 

interest rate and equity risk. 
Use of derivative financial instruments involves 
reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to 

honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a 

risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative 

contract. Counterparty default losses were less than $1 

million in 2012 and $15 million in 2011. Reserves for 

losses incurred in both 2012 and 2011 were 

established in prior years. As a result, these 

counterparty default losses did not impact income in 

either year. Hedging derivatives 
We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. For hedges 

of available-for-sale investment securities, deposits 

and long-term debt, the hedge documentation 

specifies the terms of the hedged items and the 

interest rate swaps and indicates that the derivative is 

hedging a fixed rate item and is a fair value hedge, 

that the hedge exposure is to the changes in the fair 

value of the hedged item due to changes in benchmark 

interest rates, and that the strategy is to eliminate fair 

value variability by converting fixed-rate interest 

payments to LIBOR. 
The available-for-sale investment securities hedged 
consist of sovereign debt and U.S. Treasury bonds that 

had original maturities of 30 years or less at initial 

purchase. The swaps on the sovereign debt and U.S. 

Treasury bonds are not callable. All of these securities 

are hedged with “pay fixed rate, receive variable rate” 

swaps of similar maturity, repricing and fixed rate 

coupon. At Dec. 31, 2012, $5.2 billion face amount of 

securities were hedged with interest rate swaps that 

had notional values of $5.4 billion. 
The hedged fixed rate deposits have original 
maturities of approximately ten years and are not 

callable. These deposits are hedged with “receive 

fixed rate, pay variable” rate swaps of similar 

maturity, repricing and fixed rate coupon. The swaps 

are not callable. At Dec. 31, 2012, $10 million face 

amount of deposits were hedged with interest rate 

swaps that had notional values of $10 million. 
The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged 
generally have original maturities of five to 30 years. 

We issue both callable and non-callable debt. The 

non-callable debt is hedged with simple interest rate 

swaps similar to those described for deposits. Callable 

debt is hedged with callable swaps where the call 

dates of the swaps exactly match the call dates of the 

debt. At Dec. 31, 2012, $14 billion par value of debt 

was hedged with interest rate swaps that had notional 

values of $14 billion. 
In addition, we enter into foreign exchange hedges. 
We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 

maturities of nine months or less to hedge our British 

Pound, Euro and Indian Rupee foreign exchange 

exposure with respect to foreign currency forecasted 

revenue and expense transactions in entities that have 

the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of 

Dec. 31, 2012, the hedged forecasted foreign currency 

transactions and designated forward foreign exchange 
BNY Mellon 191 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) contract hedges were $97 million (notional), with a 
pre-tax loss of less than $1 million recorded in 

accumulated other comprehensive income. This loss 

will be reclassified to income or expense over the next 

nine months. 
We use forward foreign exchange contracts with 
remaining maturities of nine months or less as hedges 

against our foreign exchange exposure to Australian 

Dollar, Euro, Swedish Krona, British Pound, 

Norwegian Krone and Japanese Yen with respect to 

interest-bearing deposits with banks and their 

associated forecasted interest revenue. These hedges 

are designated as cash flow hedges. These hedges are 

effected such that their maturities and notional values 

match those of the deposits with banks. As of Dec. 31, 

2012, the hedged interest-bearing deposits with banks 

and their designated forward foreign exchange 

contract hedges were $11.3 billion (notional), with a 

pre-tax loss of less than $1 million recorded in 

accumulated other comprehensive income. This loss 

will be reclassified to net interest revenue over the 

next nine months. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to 
hedge the value of our net investments in foreign 

subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange 

contracts usually have maturities of less than two 

years. The derivatives employed are designated as 

hedges of changes in value of our foreign investments 

due to exchange rates. Changes in the value of the 

forward foreign exchange contracts offset the changes 
in value of the foreign investments due to changes in 

foreign exchange rates. The change in fair market 

value of these forward foreign exchange contracts is 

deferred and reported within accumulated translation 

adjustments in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At 

Dec. 31, 2012, forward foreign exchange contracts 

with notional amounts totaling $5.4 billion were 

designated as hedges. 
In addition to forward foreign exchange contracts, we 
also designate non-derivative financial instruments as 

hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. 

Those non-derivative financial instruments designated 

as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

were all long-term liabilities of BNY Mellon in various 

currencies, and, at Dec. 31, 2012, had a combined U.S. 

dollar equivalent value of $524 million. 
Ineffectiveness related to derivatives and hedging

Trading activities (including trading derivatives) 
We manage trading risk through a system of position 
limits, a VaR methodology based on Monte Carlo 

simulations, stop loss advisory triggers, and other 

market sensitivity measures. Risk is monitored and 

reported to senior management by a separate unit on a 

daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR 

methodology is designed to capture the potential 

overnight pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in 

fair values of all trading positions. The calculation 

assumes a one-day holding period for most 

instruments, utilizes a 99% confidence level, and 

incorporates the non-linear characteristics of options. 

The VaR model is one of several statistical models 

used to develop economic capital results, which is 

allocated to lines of business for computing risk-

adjusted performance. 
As the VaR methodology does not evaluate risk 
attributable to extraordinary financial, economic or 

other occurrences, the risk assessment process 

includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the 

risk factors in the portfolio and management’s 

assessment of market conditions. Additional stress 

scenarios based upon historic market events are also 

performed. Stress tests, by their design, incorporate 

the impact of reduced liquidity and the breakdown of 

observed correlations. The results of these stress tests 

are reviewed weekly with senior management. 
Revenue from foreign exchange and other trading 
included the following: 
Foreign exchange and other trading 
revenue (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Foreign exchange $520 $761 $787 Other trading revenue: 
Fixed income 142 65 80 Credit derivatives/other (a) 30 22 19 Total other trading revenue 172 87 99 Total $692 $848 $886 (a) Credit derivatives are used as economic hedges of loans. 
Foreign exchange includes income from purchasing 
and selling foreign currencies and currency forwards, 

futures and options. Fixed income reflects results from 

futures and forward contracts, interest rate swaps, 

foreign currency swaps, options, and fixed income 

securities. Credit derivatives/Other primarily includes 

revenue from credit default swaps and income from 

equity securities and equity derivatives. 
Counterparty credit risk and collateral 

We assess credit risk of our counterparties through 
regular examination of their financial statements, 

confidential communication with the management of 

those counterparties and regular monitoring of 

publicly available credit rating information. This and 

other information is used to develop proprietary credit 

rating metrics used to assess credit quality. 
Collateral requirements are determined after a 
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each 

counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in 

the form of cash or highly liquid government 

securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and 

adjusted daily. 
Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial 
instruments are provided in Note 21 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter 
(“OTC”) derivative instruments 
Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral 
agreements of The Bank of New York Mellon, our 

largest banking subsidiary and the subsidiary through 

which BNY Mellon enters into the substantial 

majority of all of its OTC derivative contracts and/or 

collateral agreements, contain provisions that may 

require us to take certain actions if The Bank of 

New York Mellon’s public debt rating fell to a certain 
194 BNY Mellon 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) level. Early termination provisions, or “close-out” 
agreements, in those contracts could trigger 

immediate payment of outstanding contracts that are 

in net liability positions. Certain collateral agreements 

would require The Bank of New York Mellon to 

immediately post additional collateral to cover some 

or all of The Bank of New York Mellon’s liabilities to 

a counterparty. 
The following table shows the fair value of contracts 
falling under early termination provisions that were in 

net liability positions as of Dec. 31, 2012 for three key 

ratings triggers: 
If The Bank of New York 
Mellon’s rating was changed Potential close-out to (Moody’s/S&P) exposures (fair value) 
(a) A3/A-$ 740 million 
Baa2/BBB $ 945 million 
Bal/BB+ $2,276 million (a)< The change between rating categories is incremental, not 
cumulative. Additionally, if The Bank of New York Mellon’s debt 
rating had fallen below investment grade on Dec. 31, 

2012, existing collateral arrangements would have 

required us to have posted an additional $562 million 

of collateral. 
Note 25—Lines of businesses We have an internal information system that produces 
performance data along product and services lines for 

our two principal businesses and the Other segment. 
Organization of our business 

On Dec. 31, 2011, BNY Mellon sold its Shareowner 
Services business. In 2012, we reclassified the results 

of the Shareowner Services business from the 
Investment Services business to the Other segment. 

The reclassification did not impact consolidated 

results. All prior periods have been restated. 
Business accounting principles 

Our business data has been determined on an internal 
management basis of accounting, rather than the 

generally accepted accounting principles used for 

consolidated financial reporting. These measurement 

principles are designed so that reported results of the 

businesses will track their economic performance. 
Business results are subject to reclassification 
whenever improvements are made in the measurement 

principles, or when organizational changes are made. 
The accounting policies of the businesses are the same 
as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The operations of acquired businesses are integrated 
with the existing businesses soon after they are 

completed. As a result of the integration of staff 

support functions, management of customer 

relationships, operating processes and the financial 

impact of funding acquisitions, we cannot precisely 

determine the impact of acquisitions on income before 

taxes and therefore do not report it. 
Information on our businesses is reported on a 
continuing operations basis for 2010. See Note 4 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a 

discussion of discontinued operations.

Š Credit-related activities

Business exits 
The results of our businesses are presented and analyzed on an internal management reporting basis:< 
Š Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue 
generated by each business. Fee and other 

revenue transferred between businesses under 

revenue transfer agreements is included within 

other revenue in each business. 
Š Revenues and expenses associated with specific 

client bases are included in those businesses. For 

example, foreign exchange activity associated 

with clients using custody products is allocated 

to Investment Services. 
Š Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses 

based on the yields on the assets and liabilities 

generated by each business. We employ a funds 

transfer pricing system that matches funds with 

the specific assets and liabilities of each 

business based on their interest sensitivity and 

maturity characteristics. 
Š Support and other indirect expenses are 

allocated to businesses based on internally-

developed methodologies. 
Š Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the 

businesses based on average deposits generated 

within each business. 
Š Litigation expense is generally recorded in the 

business in which the charge occurs. 
Š Management of the investment securities 

portfolio is a shared service contained in the 

Other segment. As a result, gains and losses 
associated with the valuation of the securities 

portfolio are included in the Other segment. 
Š Client deposits serve as the primary funding 

source for our investment securities portfolio. 

We typically allocate all interest revenue to the 

businesses generating the deposits. Accordingly, 

accretion related to the restructured investment 

securities portfolio has been included in the 

results of the businesses. 
Š Net securities gains (losses) are recorded in the 

Other segment. Š M&I expenses and restructuring charges are 

corporate level items and are therefore recorded 

in the Other segment. 
Š Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their 

related income or expense are specifically 

assigned to each business. Businesses with a net 

liability position have been allocated assets. 
Š Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected 

within individual businesses. 
Total revenue includes approximately $2.3 billion in 

2012, $2.2 billion in 2011 and $2.1 billion in 2010, of 

international operations domiciled in the UK which 

comprised 16%, 15% and 15% of total revenue, 

respectively. 196 BNY Mellon

Management and Investment Services fee revenue 

generating businesses, foreign exchange trading 

activity, loans and other revenue producing assets and 

transactions in which the customer is domiciled 

outside of the United States and/or the international 

activity is resident at an international entity. Due to 

the nature of our international and domestic activities, 

it is not possible to precisely distinguish between 

internationally and domestically domiciled customers. 
As a result, it is necessary to make certain subjective 

assumptions such as: 
Š Income from international operations is

allowance for credit losses. 
Š Expense charges to international operations 

include those directly incurred in connection

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders 
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 
and subsidiaries (“BNY Mellon”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of 

income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 

ended December 31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of BNY Mellon’s 

management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 

audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 

evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 

financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of BNY Mellon as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their 

cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with 

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 

(United States), BNY Mellon’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria 

established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 

the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on 

the effectiveness of BNY Mellon’s internal control over financial reporting.
