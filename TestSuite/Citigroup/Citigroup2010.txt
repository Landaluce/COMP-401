the laws of the State of Delaware. Following a series of transactions over a 
number of years, Citigroup Inc. was formed in 1998 upon the merger of 
Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.Citigroup is a global diversified financial services holding company whose businesses provide consumers, corporations, governments and institutions 
with a broad range of financial products and services. Citi has approximately 
200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160
 countries and jurisdictions.Citigroup currently operates, for management reporting purposes, via two primary business segments: Citicorp, consisting of Citi™s 
Regional Consumer 
Banking businesses and Institutional Clients Group; and Citi Holdings, 
consisting of Citi™s 
Brokerage and Asset Management and Local Consumer 
Lending businesses, and a Special Asset Pool. There is also a third segment, 
Corporate/Other. For a further description of the business segments and 
the products and services they provide, see ﬁCitigroup Segmentsﬂ below,

At December 31, 2010, Citi had approximately 260,000 full-time employees compared to approximately 265,300 full-time employees at 
December 31, 2009. Please see ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could materially impact 
Citigroup™s financial condition and results of operations.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods™ financial statements to conform to the current period™s presentation.
Impact of Adoption of SFAS 166/167As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2010, Citigroup adopted 
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 860, Transfers and Servicing, formerly SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial 
Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166), and ASC 810, Consolidations, formerly SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB 
Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167). Among other requirements, the 
adoption of these standards includes the requirement that Citi consolidate 
certain of its credit card securitization trusts and cease sale accounting 
for transfers of credit card receivables to those trusts. As a result, reported 
and managed-basis presentations are comparable for periods beginning 
January 1, 2010. For comparison purposes, prior period revenues, net credit 
losses, provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims and loans are 
presented where indicated on a managed basis in this Form 10-K. Managed 
presentations were applicable only to Citi™s North American branded 
and retail partner credit card operations in North America Regional 
Consumer Banking and Citi HoldingsŠLocal Consumer Lending 
and any aggregations in which they are included. See ﬁCapital Resources 
and Liquidityﬂ and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
an additional discussion of the adoption of SFAS 166/167 and its impact

26MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSEXECUTIVE SUMMARY2010 Summary ResultsDuring 2010, Citi continued to execute its strategy of growing and investing 
in its core businesses in CiticorpŠRegional Consumer Banking, Securities 
and Banking and Transaction ServicesŠwhile at the same time winding 
down the assets and businesses in Citi Holdings in an economically 
rational manner. CitigroupCitigroup reported net income for 2010 of $10.6 billion, compared to a net 
loss of $1.6 billion in 2009. Diluted EPS was $0.35 per share in 2010 versus 
a loss of $0.80 per share in 2009, and net revenues were $86.6 billion in 
2010, versus $91.1 billion in 2009, on a comparable basis. On a reported 
basis, net interest revenue increased by $5.7 billion, or 12%, to $54.7 billion 
in 2010, generally as a result of the adoption of SFAS 166/167, partially 
offset by the continued run-off of higher-yielding assets in Citi Holdings and 
investments in lower-yielding securities. Non-interest revenues improved by 
approximately $578 million, or 2%, to $31.9 billion in 2010, primarily due 
to positive gross revenue marks in the Special Asset Pool in Citi Holdings of 
$2.0 billion in 2010 versus negative revenue marks of $4.6 billion in 2009, a 
$11.1 billion gain in 2009 on the sale of Smith Barney, a $1.4 billion pretax 
gain related to the public and private exchange offers consummated in July 
and September of 2009, and a $10.1 billion pretax loss associated with the 
repayment of TARP and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement with the 
U.S. government in December 2009. CiticorpDespite continued weaker market conditions, Citicorp net income remained 
strong in 2010 at $14.9 billion versus $15.3 billion in 2009, with earnings 
in Asia and Latin America contributing more than half of the total. The 
continued strength of the core Citi franchise was demonstrated by Citicorp 
revenues of $65.6 billion for 2010, with a 3% growth in revenues in Regional Consumer Banking
 on a comparable basis and a 3% growth in 
Transaction Services, offset by lower revenues in Securities and Banking. Business drivers in international Regional Consumer Banking reflected the impact in 2010 of the accelerating pace of economic recovery in regions 
outside of North America and increased investment spending by Citi: Revenues of $17.7 billion were up 9% year over year.
Net income more than doubled to $4.2 billion.Average deposits and average loans each grew by 12% year over year.
Card purchase sales grew 17% year over year. 
Securities and Banking revenues declined 15% to $23.1 billion in 2010. Excluding the impact of credit value adjustments (CVA), revenues were down 

19% year over year to $23.5 billion. The decrease mainly reflected the impact 
of lower overall client market activity and more challenging global capital 
market conditions in 2010, as compared to 2009, which was a particularly 
strong year driven by robust fixed income markets and higher client activity 
levels in investment banking, especially in the first half of the year.
Citi HoldingsCiti Holdings™ net loss decreased 52%, from $8.9 billion to $4.2 billion, as 
compared to 2009. Lower revenues reflected the absence of the $11.1 billion 
pretax gain on the sale of Smith Barney in 2009 as well as a declining loan 
balance resulting mainly from asset sales and net paydowns. Citi Holdings assets stood at $359 billion at the end of 2010, down $128 billion, or 26%, from $487 billion at the end of 2009. Adjusting for the impact of adopting SFAS 166/167, which added approximately $43 billion of 

assets to the balance sheet on January 1, 2010, Citi Holdings assets were down 
by $171 billion during 2010, consisting of approximately:$108 billion in asset sales and business dispositions; $50 billion of net run-off and paydowns; and $13 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. As of December 31, 2010, Citi Holdings represented 19% of Citigroup assets, as compared to 38% in the first quarter of 2008. At December 31, 2010, 
Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets were approximately $330 billion, or 34%, of 

total Citigroup risk-weighted assets. Credit CostsGlobal credit continued to recover with the sixth consecutive quarter of 
sustained improvement in credit costs in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 
the full year, Citigroup net credit losses declined $11.4 billion, or 27%, to 
$30.9 billion in 2010 on a comparable basis, reflecting improvement in 
net credit losses in every region. During 2010, Citi released $5.8 billion in 
net reserves for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments, primarily 
driven by international Regional Consumer Banking, retail partner cards 
in Local Consumer Lending and the Corporate loan portfolio, while it built 
$8.3 billion of reserves in 2009. The total provision for credit losses and for 
benefits and claims of $26.0 billion in 2010 decreased 50% on a comparable 
basis year over year. Net credit losses in Citicorp declined 10% year-over-year on a comparable 
basis to $11.8 billion, and Citicorp released $2.2 billion in net reserves for 
loan losses and unfunded lending commitments, compared to a $2.9 billion 
reserve build in 2009. Net credit losses in Citi Holdings declined 35% on a 
comparable basis to $19.1 billion, and Citi Holdings released $3.6 billion in 
net reserves for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments, compared 
to a $5.4 billion reserve build in 2009. 27Operating ExpensesCitigroup operating expenses were down 1% versus the prior year at 
$47.4 billion in 2010, as increased investment spending, FX translation, and inflation in Citicorp were more than offset by lower expenses in Citi Holdings. 
In Citicorp, expenses increased 10% year over year to $35.9 billion, mainly 
due to higher investment spending across all Citicorp businesses as well 
as FX translation and inflation. In Citi Holdings, operating expenses were 
down 31% year over year to $9.6 billion, reflecting the continued reduction 
of assets. Capital and Loan Loss Reserve PositionsCiti increased its Tier 1 Common and Tier 1 Capital ratios during 2010. At 

December 31, 2010, Citi™s Tier 1 Common ratio was 10.
8% and its Tier 1 

Capital ratio was 12.9%, compared to 9.6% and 11.7% at December 31, 2009, 
respectively. Tier 1 Common was relatively flat year over year at $105 billion, 

even after absorbing a $14.2 billion reduction from the impact of SFAS 

166/167 in the first quarter, while total risk-weighted assets declined 10% to 

$978 billion. Citigroup ended the year with a total allowance for loan losses of $40.7 billion, up $4.6 billion, or 13%, from the prior year, reflecting the 

impact of adopting SFAS 166/167 which added $13.4 billion on January 

1, 2010. The allowance represented 6.31% of total loans and 209% of 
non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2010, up from 6.09% and 114%, 
respectively, at the end of 2009. The consumer loan loss reserve was 

$35.4 billion at December 31, 2010, representing 7.77% of total loans, versus $28.4 billion, or 6.70%, at December 31, 2009.Liquidity and FundingCitigroup maintained a high level of liquidity, with aggregate liquidity 

resources (including cash at major central banks and unencumbered liquid 
securities) of $322 billion at year-end 2010, up from $316 billion at year-end 

2009. Citi also continued to grow its deposit base, closing 2010 with $845 
billion in deposits, up 1% from year-end 2009. Structural liquidity (defined as 

deposits, long-term debt and equity as a percentage of total assets) remained 
strong at 73% as of December 31, 2010, flat compared to December 31, 2009, 
and up from 66% at December 31, 2008. Citigroup issued approximately $22 billion (excluding local country and securitizations) of long-term debt in 2010, representing just over half of its 
2010 long-term maturities, due to its strong liquidity position and proceeds 
received from asset reductions in Citi Holdings. For additional information, 
see ﬁCapital Resources and LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ below.
2011 Business OutlookIn 2011, management will continue its focus on growing and investing in 
the core Citicorp franchise, while economically rationalizing Citi Holdings. 
However, Citigroup™s results will continue to be affected by factors outside 

of its control, such as the global economic and regulatory environment 
in the regions in which Citi operates. In particular, the macroeconomic 

environment in the U.S. remains challenging, with unemployment levels 
still elevated and continued pressure and uncertainty in the housing market, 
including home prices. Additionally, the continued implementation of 

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

(Financial Reform Act), including the ongoing extensive rulemaking and 
interpretive issues, as well as the new capital standards for bank holding 
companies as adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(Basel Committee) and U.S. regulators, will remain a significant source 
of uncertainty in 2011. Moreover, the implementation of the change in 

methodology for calculating FDIC insurance premiums, to be effective in 
the second quarter 2011, will have a negative impact on Citi™s earnings. 

(For additional information on these factors, see ﬁCapital Resources and 
Liquidityﬂ and ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below.) 
In Citicorp, Securities and Banking results for 2011 will depend on the level of client activity and on macroeconomic conditions, market valuations 
and volatility, interest rates and other market factors. 
Transaction Services
 
business performance will also continue to be impacted by macroeconomic 
conditions as well as market factors, including interest rate levels, global 
economic and trade activity, volatility in capital markets, foreign exchange 

and market valuations. In Regional Consumer Banking, results during the year are likely to be driven by different trends in North America versus the international 
regions. In North America, if economic recovery is sustained, revenues could 
grow modestly, particularly in the second half of the year, assuming loan 

demand begins to recover. However, net credit margin in 
North America will 
likely continue to be driven primarily by improvement in net credit losses. 
Internationally, given continued economic expansion in these regions, net 

credit margin is likely to be driven by revenue growth, particularly in the 
second half of the year, as investment spending should continue to generate 

volume growth to outpace spread compression. International credit costs are 
likely to increase in 2011, reflecting a growing loan portfolio. In Citi Holdings, revenues for Local Consumer Lending should continue 
to decline reflecting a shrinking loan balance resulting from paydowns and 

asset sales. Based on current delinquency trends and ongoing loss-mitigation 

actions, credit costs are expected to continue to improve. Overall, however, 

Local Consumer Lending will likely continue to drive results in Citi Holdings. 
Operating expenses are expected to show some variability across quarters as the Company continues to invest in Citicorp while rationalizing Citi 
Holdings and maintaining expense discipline. Although Citi currently 
expects net interest margin (NIM) to remain under pressure during the 
first quarter of 2011, driven by continued low yields on investments and the 
run-off of higher yielding loan assets, NIM could begin to stabilize during the 
remainder of the year.

$607(17)%2010 vs. 2009Revenues, net of interest expense increased 72% from the prior year, primarily due to the consolidation of securitized credit card receivables 
pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 166/167 effective January 1, 2010. On a 
comparable basis, Revenues, net of interest expense, declined 3% from the 
prior year, mainly due to lower volumes in branded cards as well as the net 
impact of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act 
of 2009 (CARD Act) on cards revenues. This decrease was partially offset by 
better mortgage-related revenues.Net interest revenue was down 6% on a comparable basis driven primarily by lower volumes in cards, with average managed loans down 7% 
from the prior year, and in retail banking, where average loans declined 11%. 

The increase in deposit volumes, up 4% from the prior year, was offset by 

lower spreads in the current interest rate environment. Non-interest revenue increased 9% on a comparable basis from the prior year mainly driven by better servicing hedge results and higher gains from 
loan sales in mortgages.Operating expenses increased 4% from the prior year, driven by the impact 
of litigation reserves in the first quarter of 2010 and higher marketing costs.Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims increased $6.0 billion primarily due to the consolidation of securitized credit card 
receivables pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 166/167. On a comparable 

basis, Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased $0.9 billion, or 11%, primarily due to a net loan loss reserve release of 
$0.3 billion in 2010 compared to a $0.5 billion loan loss reserve build in the 
prior year, and lower net credit losses in the branded cards portfolio. Also on 

a comparable basis, the cards net credit loss ratio increased 61 basis points to 
10.02%, driven by lower average loans.352009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense were fairly flat as higher credit losses in the securitization trusts were offset by higher net interest margin in 
cards, higher volumes in retail banking, and higher gains from loan sales 
in mortgages.Net interest revenue was up 20% driven by the impact of pricing actions relating to the CARD Act and lower funding costs in Citi-branded cards, and 
by higher deposit and loan volumes in retail banking, with average deposits 
up 12% and average loans up 11%. Non-interest revenue declined 21%, driven by higher credit losses 
flowing through the securitization trusts and by the absence of a 

$349
 million gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $170 million gain from 
a cards portfolio sale in 2008. This decline was partially offset by higher 

gains from loan sales in mortgages.  Operating expenses declined 34%. Excluding a 2008 goodwill impairment charge of $2.3 billion, expenses were down 12% reflecting the 
benefits from re-engineering efforts, lower marketing costs, and the absence 
of $217 million of repositioning charges in 2008 offset by the absence of a 
$159 million Visa litigation reserve release in 2008.
Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 
$642
 million, or 59%, primarily due to rising net credit losses in both cards 
and retail banking. The continued weakening of leading credit indicators and 

trends in the macroeconomic environment during the period, including rising 

unemployment and higher bankruptcy filings, drove higher credit costs. The 

cards managed net credit loss ratio increased 376 basis points to 9.41%, while 

the retail banking net credit loss ratio increased 44 basis points to 0.90%.36EMEA REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKINGEMEA Regional Consumer Banking (EMEA RCB) provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Remaining activities in respect of Western Europe retail banking are included 
in Citi Holdings. EMEA RCB has generally repositioned its business, shifting from a strategy of widespread distribution to a focused strategy concentrating on 
larger urban markets within the region. An exception is Bank Handlowy, which has a mass market presence in Poland. The countries in which EMEA RCB has the largest presence are Poland, Turkey, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. At December 31, 2010, EMEA RCB had 298 retail bank branches with 3.7 million customer accounts, $4.4 billion in retail banking loans and $9.2 billion in average deposits. In addition, the business had 2.5 million Citi-branded card 
accounts with $2.8 billion in outstanding card loan balances.In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

$103NM2010 vs. 2009Revenues, net of interest expense declined 3% from the prior-year period. The decrease was due to lower lending revenues, driven by the repositioning 
of the lending strategy toward better profile customer segments for new 
acquisitions and liquidation of the existing non-strategic customer portfolios, 
across EMEA RCB markets. The lower lending revenues were partially 
offset by a 45% growth in investment sales with assets under management 
increasing by 14%. Net interest revenue was 5% lower than the prior year due to lower retail volumes, with average loans for retail banking down 17%. Non-interest revenue was higher by 1%, reflecting a marginal increase in the contribution from an equity investment in Turkey.
Operating expenses increased by 7%, reflecting targeted investment spending, expansion of the sales force and regulatory and legal expenses.Provisions for loan losses decreased by $597 million to $197 million. Net credit losses decreased from $487 million to $320 million, while the loan 
loss reserve had a release of $119 million in 2010 compared to a build of 
$307 million in 2009. These numbers reflected the ongoing improvement in 
credit quality during the period.372009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense declined 17%. More than half of the revenue decline was attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation 
(FX translation). Other drivers included lower wealth-management and 
lending revenues due to lower volumes and spread compression from credit 
tightening initiatives. Investment sales declined by 26% due to market 
conditions at the start of 2009, with assets under management increasing by 
9% by year end. Net interest revenue was 23% lower than the prior year due to external competitive pressure on rates and higher funding costs, with average loans 
for retail banking down 18% and average deposits down 18%. Non-interest revenue decreased by 3%, primarily due to the impact of FX translation. Excluding FX translation, there was marginal growth.Operating expenses declined 27%, reflecting expense control actions, lower marketing expenses and the impact of FX translation. Cost savings 
were achieved by branch closures, headcount reductions and process 
re-engineering efforts. Provisions for loan losses increased $482 million to $794 million. Net 
credit losses increased from $237 million to $487 million, while the loan loss 

reserve build increased from $75 million to $307 million. Higher credit costs 

reflected the continued credit deterioration across the region during the period.

Operating expenses increased 14% as compared to the  prior year, 
primarily driven by investments and the impact of FX translation. The increase in 2010 was primarily driven by an increase in transaction volumes, 
higher investment spending and FX translation.Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased 61%, primarily reflecting loan loss reserve releases of $826 million compared to a 
build of $426 million in the prior year. This decrease resulted from improved 

credit conditions, improved portfolio quality and lower net credit losses in 
the branded cards portfolio driven by Mexico, partially offset by higher credit 
costs attributable to higher volumes, particularly as the year progressed.392009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense declined 17%, driven by the impact of FX translation as well as lower activity in the branded cards business.Net interest revenue decreased 18%, mainly driven by FX translation 
as well as lower volumes and spread compression in the branded cards 

business that offset the growth in loans, deposits and investment products 

in the retail business.Non-interest revenue decreased 13%, driven also by FX translation and lower branded cards fee income from lower customer activity.
Operating expenses decreased 51%, primarily driven by the absence of the goodwill impairment charge of $4.3 billion in 2008, the benefit associated 
with FX translation and savings from restructuring actions implemented 
primarily at the end of 2008. A $125 million restructuring charge in 2008 
was offset by an expense benefit of $257 million related to a legal vehicle 
restructuring. Expenses increased slightly in the fourth quarter 2009, 
primarily due to selected marketing and investment spending.Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased 14% 
primarily reflecting lower loan loss reserve builds as a result of lower volumes, 

improved portfolio quality and lower net credit losses in the branded cards 

portfolio, primarily in Mexico due to repositioning in the portfolio.40ASIA REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKINGAsia Regional Consumer Banking (Asia RCB) provides traditional banking and Citi-branded card services to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, with the largest Citi presence in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, India and Indonesia. At December 31, 2010, Asia RCB had 711 retail branches, 16.1 million retail banking accounts, $105.6 billion in average customer deposits, and $61.2 billion in retail banking loans. In 
addition, the business had 15.1 million Citi-branded card accounts with $20.4 billion in outstanding loan balances. In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

impact of FX translation, partially offset by lower spreads. Net interest revenue was 6% higher than the prior-year period, mainly 
due to higher lending and deposit volumes and the impact of FX translation, 
partially offset by lower spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 20%, primarily due to higher investment revenues, higher cards purchase sales, and the impact of FX translation.Operating expenses increased 14%, primarily due to an increase in volumes, continued investment spending, and the impact of FX translation. Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased 61%, mainly due to the impact of a net credit reserve release of $285 million in 
2010, compared to a $523 million net credit reserve build in the prior-
year period, and a 24% decline in net credit losses. These declines were 
partially offset by the impact of FX translation. The decrease in provision 
for loan losses and for benefits and claims reflected continued credit quality 
improvement across the region, particularly in India, partially offset by 
increasing volumes. During 2010, the effective tax rate in Japan was approximately 19%, which reflected continued tax benefits (APB 23). These benefits are not likely 
to continue, or continue at the same levels, in 2011, however, which will 

likely lead to an increase in the effective tax rate for Asia RCB in 2011.412009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense declined 9%, driven by the absence of the gain on Visa shares in 2008, lower investment product revenues and cards 
purchase sales, lower spreads, and the impact of FX translation. Net interest revenue was 5% lower than in 2008.  Average loans and 
deposits were down 10% and 4%, respectively, in each case partly due to the 

impact of FX translation. Non-interest revenue declined 19%, primarily due to the decline in investment revenues, lower cards purchase sales, the absence of the gain on 
Visa shares and the impact of FX translation.
Operating expenses declined 9%, reflecting the benefits of re-engineering 
efforts and the impact of FX translation. Expenses increased slightly in the 
fourth quarter 2009, primarily due to targeted marketing and investment 
spending. Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims increased 29%, mainly due to the impact of a higher credit reserve build and an increase in 
net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In the first 
half of 2009, rising credit losses were particularly apparent in the portfolios 
in India and South Korea. However, delinquencies improved in the latter part 

of the year and net credit losses flattened as the region showed early signs of 
economic recovery and increased levels of customer activity.

Securities and Banking revenues$23,084(15)%442010 vs. 2009Revenues, net of interest expense of $23.1 billion decreased 15%, or $4.0 billion, from $27.1 billion in 2009, which was a particularly strong 
year driven by robust fixed income markets and higher client activity levels 
in investment banking, especially in the first half of that year. The decline 
in revenue was mainly due to fixed income markets, which decreased from 
$21.0 billion to $14.3 billion (excluding CVA, net of hedges, of negative 
$0.2 billion and positive $0.3 billion in the current year and prior year, 
respectively). This decrease primarily reflected weaker results in rates and 
currencies, credit products and securitized products, due to an overall 
weaker market environment. Equity markets declined from $5.4 billion 
to $3.7 billion (excluding CVA, net of hedges, of negative $0.2 billion and 
negative $2.2 billion in the current year and prior year, respectively), driven 
by lower trading revenues linked to the derivatives business and principal 
positions. Investment banking revenues declined from $4.8 billion to 
$3.8 billion, reflecting lower levels of market activity in debt and equity 
underwriting. The declines were partially offset by an increase in lending 
revenues and CVA. Lending revenues increased from negative $2.5 billion to 
positive $0.9 billion, mainly driven by a reduction in losses on credit default 
swap hedges. CVA increased $1.6 billion to negative $0.4 billion, mainly due 
to a larger narrowing of Citigroup spreads in 2009 compared to 2010.Operating expenses increased 11%, or $1.5 billion. Excluding the 2010 U.K. bonus tax impact and litigation reserve releases in 2010 and 2009, 
operating expenses increased 8%, or $1.0 billion, mainly as a result of higher 
compensation and transaction costs.Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased by $1.8 billion, to negative $25 million, mainly due to credit reserve releases 
and lower net credit losses as the result of an improvement in the credit 
environment during 2010.2009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense of $27.1 billion increased 10%, or 
$2.4 billion, from $24.7 billion, as markets began to recover in the early 
part of 2009, bringing back higher levels of volume activity and higher 
levels of liquidity, which began to decline again in the third quarter of 
2009. The growth in revenue was driven mainly by an $8.1 billion increase 
to $21.0 billion in fixed income markets (excluding CVA, net of hedges, of 
positive $0.3 billion and positive $0.7 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively), 
reflecting strong trading opportunities across all asset classes in the first half 
of 2009. Equity markets doubled from $2.7 billion to $5.4 billion (excluding 
CVA, net of hedges, of negative $2.2 billion and positive $0.1 billion in 2009 
and 2008, respectively), with growth being driven by derivatives, convertibles, 
and equity trading. Investment banking revenues grew $1.5 billion, from 
$3.3 billion to $4.8 billion, primarily from increases in debt and equity 
underwriting activities reflecting higher transaction volumes from depressed 
2008 levels. These increases were partially offset by decreases in lending 
revenues and CVA. Lending revenues decreased by $7.3 billion, from 
$4.8 billion to negative $2.5 billion, primarily from losses on credit default 
swap hedges. CVA decreased from $0.9 billion to negative $2.0 billion, mainly 
due to the narrowing of Citigroup spreads throughout 2009.Operating expenses decreased 17%, or $2.8 billion. Excluding the 2008 repositioning and restructuring charges and a 2009 litigation reserve 
release, operating expenses declined 9%, or $1.4 billion, mainly as a result of 
headcount reductions and benefits from expense management.Provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased 12%, or $232 million, to $1.8 billion, mainly due to lower credit reserve builds and 
net credit losses, due to an improved credit environment, particularly in the 
latter part of 2009.45TRANSACTION SERVICESTransaction Services is composed of Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities and Fund Services (SFS). TTS provides comprehensive cash management and trade finance and services for corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities worldwide. SFS provides securities services to 
investors, such as global asset managers, custody and clearing services to intermediaries such as broker-dealers, and depository and agency/trust services to 
multinational corporations and governments globally. Revenue is generated from net interest revenue on deposits in TTS and SFS, as well as from trade loans 
and fees for transaction processing and fees on assets under custody and administration in SFS.In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

$ 33310%(in trillions of dollars)12.642010 vs. 2009Revenues, net of interest expense, grew 3% compared to 2009, reflecting a strong year despite a low interest rate environment, driven by growth in both the TTS and SFS businesses. TTS revenues grew 2% as a result of increased 
customer liability balances and solid growth in trade and fees, partially offset 
by spread compression. SFS revenues improved by 3% on higher volumes and 
balances reflecting the impact of sales and increased market activity.Average deposits and other customer liability balances grew 10%, driven by strong growth in the emerging markets.Operating expenses grew 8% due to investment spending and higher business volumes.Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined as compared to 2009, attributable to overall improvement in portfolio quality.
2009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense declined 2% compared to 2008 as strong 
growth in balances was more than offset by lower spreads driven by low 
interest rates and reduced securities asset valuations globally. TTS revenues 
grew 7% as a result of strong growth in balances and higher trade revenues. SFS revenues declined 18%, attributable to reductions in asset valuations and 
volumes.Average deposits and other customer liability balances grew 8%, driven by strong growth in all regions.Operating expenses declined 12%, mainly as a result of benefits from expense management and re-engineering initiatives.Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined 80%, primarily attributable to overall portfolio management.46CITI HOLDINGSCiti Holdings contains businesses and portfolios of assets that Citigroup has determined are not central to its core Citicorp businesses. Consistent with its strategy, Citi intends to exit these businesses as quickly as practicable in an economically rational manner through business divestitures, portfolio run-offs and asset 
sales. During 2009 and 2010, Citi made substantial progress divesting and exiting businesses from Citi Holdings, having completed more than 30 divestiture 
transactions, including Smith Barney, Nikko Cordial Securities, Nikko Asset Management, Primerica Financial Services, various credit card businesses 
(including Diners Club North America) and The Student Loan Corporation (which is reported as discontinued operations within the Corporate/Other segment 
for the second half of 2010 only). Citi Holdings™ GAAP assets of $359 billion have been reduced by $128 billion from December 31, 2009, and $468 billion 
from the peak in the first quarter of 2008. Citi Holdings™ GAAP assets of $359 billion represent approximately 19% of Citi™s assets as of December 31, 2010. Citi 
Holdings™ risk-weighted assets of approximately $330 billion represent approximately 34% of Citi™s risk-weighted assets as of December 31, 2010.Citi Holdings consists of the following: Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending, and Special Asset Pool.In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

This segment was substantially reduced in size due to the sale in 2009 of Smith Barney to the Morgan 
Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB JV) and of Nikko Cordial Securities (reported as discontinued operations within Corporate/Other for all periods 
presented). At December 31, 2010, BAM had approximately $27 billion of assets, primarily consisting of Citi™s investment in, and assets related to, the MSSB JV.

($6.7 billion after tax) related to the MSSB JV transaction in the second 
quarter of 2009 and a $320 million pretax gain on the sale of the managed 
futures business to the MSSB JV in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding these 
gains, revenue decreased primarily due to the absence of Smith Barney from 
May 2009 onwards and the absence of Nikko Asset Management, partially 
offset by higher revenues from the MSSB JV and an improvement in marks in 
Retail Alternative Investments.Operating expenses decreased 70% from the prior year, mainly driven 
by the absence of Smith Barney from May 2009 onwards, lower MSSB JV 
separation-related costs and the absence of Nikko and Colfondos, partially 
offset by higher legal settlements and reserves associated with Smith Barney.
Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims decreased 57%, mainly due to the absence of credit reserve builds.Assets decreased 10% versus the prior year, mostly driven by the sales of the 
Citi private equity business and the run-off of tailored loan portfolios.2009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense increased 84% versus the prior year 
mainly driven by the gain on sale related to the MSSB JV transaction and the 
gain on the sale of the managed futures business to the MSSB JV. Excluding 
these gains, revenue decreased primarily due to the absence of Smith Barney 
from May 2009 onwards and the absence of 2009 fourth-quarter revenue of 
Nikko Asset Management, partially offset by an improvement in marks in 
Retail Alternative Investments. Revenues in 2008 included a $347 million 
pretax gain on the sale of CitiStreet and charges related to the settlement of 
auction rate securities of $393 million pretax.Operating expenses decreased 65% from 2008, mainly driven by the absence 
of Smith Barney and Nikko Asset Management expenses, re-engineering 

efforts and the absence of 2008 one-time expenses ($0.9 billion intangible 

impairment, $0.2 billion of restructuring and $0.5 billion of write-downs and 

other charges).Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 36%, mainly reflecting an increase in reserve builds of $28 million.Assets decreased 3% versus the prior year, mostly driven by 
the impact of the sale of Nikko Asset Management.48LOCAL CONSUMER LENDING Local Consumer Lending (LCL), which constituted approximately 70% of Citi Holdings by assets as of December 31, 2010, includes a portion of Citigroup™s North American mortgage business, retail partner cards, Western European cards and retail banking, CitiFinancial North America and other local Consumer 
finance businesses globally. The Student Loan Corporation is reported as discontinued operations within the Corporate/Other segment for the second half 
of 2010 only. At December 31, 2010, LCL had $252 billion of assets ($226 billion in North America). Approximately $129 billion of assets in LCL as of December 31, 2010 consisted of U.S. mortgages in the Company™s CitiMortgage and CitiFinancial operations. The North American assets consist of residential 
mortgage loans (first and second mortgages), retail partner card loans, personal loans, commercial real estate (CRE), and other consumer loans and assets.In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

offset by the impact of lower balances due to portfolio run-off and asset sales. 
Non-interest revenue declined 58%, primarily due to the absence of the 
$1.1 billion gain on the sale of Redecard in the first quarter of 2009 and a 
higher mortgage repurchase reserve charge. Operating expenses decreased 18%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures, lower volumes, re-engineering actions and the absence of costs 
associated with the U.S. government loss-sharing agreement, which was 
exited in the fourth quarter of 2009. Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims decreased 38%, reflecting a net $1.8 billion credit reserve release in 2010 compared to 
a $5.8 billion build in 2009. Lower net credit losses across most businesses 
were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of SFAS 166/167. On 

a comparable basis, net credit losses were lower year-over-year, driven 

by improvement in U.S. mortgages, international portfolios and retail 
partner cards. Assets declined 21% from the prior year, primarily driven by portfolio 
run-off, higher loan loss reserve balances, and the impact of asset sales and 
divestitures, partially offset by an increase of $41 billion resulting from the 
adoption of SFAS 166/167. Key divestitures in 2010 included The Student 

Loan Corporation, Primerica, auto loans, the Canadian Mastercard business 
and U.S. retail sales finance portfolios.2009 vs. 2008 Revenues, net of interest expense decreased 24% from the prior year. Net 
interest revenue was 24% lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower 
balances, de-risking of the portfolio, and spread compression. Non-interest revenue decreased $1.6 billion, mostly driven by the impact of higher 
credit losses flowing through the securitization trusts, partially offset by the 
$1.1 billion gain on the sale of Redecard in the first quarter of 2009.Operating expenses declined 31% from the prior year, due to lower 
volumes and reductions from expense re-engineering actions, and the impact 

of goodwill write-offs of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially 
offset by higher costs associated with delinquent loans.Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 14% from the prior year, reflecting an increase in net credit losses of $6.1 billion, 

partially offset by lower reserve builds of $2.8 billion. Higher net credit losses 
were primarily driven by higher losses of $3.6 billion in residential real estate 
lending, $1.0 billion in retail partner cards, and $0.7 billion in international.Assets decreased $57 billion from the prior year, primarily driven by lower 
originations, wind-down of specific businesses, asset sales, divestitures, write-
offs and higher loan loss reserve balances. Key divestitures in 2009 included 
the FI credit card business, Italy Consumer finance, Diners Europe, Portugal 
cards, Norway Consumer and Diners Club North America. 49Japan Consumer FinanceCitigroup continues to actively monitor a number of matters involving its Japan Consumer Finance business, including customer refund claims and 
defaults, as well as financial and legislative, regulatory, judicial and other 
political developments, relating to the charging of gray zone interest. Gray 
zone interest represents interest at rates that are legal but for which claims 
may not be enforceable. Although Citi determined in 2008 to exit its Japan 
Consumer Finance business and has been liquidating its portfolio and 
otherwise winding down the business, this business has incurred, and will 
continue to face, net credit losses and refunds, due in part to legislative, 
regulatory and judicial actions taken in recent years. These actions may also 
reduce credit availability and increase potential claims and losses relating to 
gray zone interest.In September 2010, one of Japan™s largest consumer finance companies 
(Takefuji) declared bankruptcy and is currently in the process of 

restructuring, with court protection and assistance. Citi believes this action 
reflects the financial distress that Japan's top consumer finance lenders are 
facing as they continue to deal with liabilities for gray zone interest refund 
claims. During 2010, LCL recorded a charge of approximately $325 million 
(pretax) to increase its reserves related to customer refunds in the Japan 
Consumer Finance business. Citi continues to monitor and evaluate these developments and the potential impact to both currently and previously outstanding loans in 
this business, and its reserves related thereto. However, the trend in the 

type, number and amount of claims, and the potential full amount of 
losses and their impact on Citi, requires evaluation in a potentially volatile 
environment, is subject to significant uncertainties and continues to be 
difficult to predict.50SPECIAL ASSET POOLSpecial Asset Pool (SAP), which constituted approximately 22% of Citi Holdings by assets as of December 31, 2010, is a portfolio of securities, loans and other assets that Citigroup intends to actively reduce over time through asset sales and portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2010, SAP had $80 billion of assets. SAP assets have declined by $248 billion, or 76%, from peak levels in 2007 reflecting cumulative write-downs, asset sales and portfolio run-off.In millions of dollars2010% Change 2010 vs. 2009

$2.6 billion in 2009 as compared to positive marks of $3.4 billion in 2010 
(see ﬁItems Impacting SAP Revenuesﬂ below). Revenue in the current year 
included positive marks of $2.0 billion related to sub-prime related direct 
exposure, a positive $0.5 billion CVA related to the monoline insurers, and 
$0.4 billion on private equity positions. These positive marks were partially 
offset by negative revenues of $0.5 billion on Alt-A mortgages and $0.4 billion 
on commercial real estate.Operating expenses decreased 33% in 2010, mainly driven by the absence of the U.S. government loss-sharing agreement, lower compensation, and 
lower transaction expenses.Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims decreased $4.8 billion due to a decrease in net credit losses of $3.4 billion and a 
higher release of loan loss reserves and unfunded lending commitments 
of $1.4 billion.Assets declined 41% from the prior year, primarily driven by sales and 
amortization and prepayments. Asset sales of $39 billion for the year of 2010 
generated pretax gains of approximately $1.3 billion.2009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense increased $36.4 billion in 2009, primarily 
due to the absence of significant negative revenue marks occurring in the 
prior year. Total negative marks were $2.6 billion in 2009 as compared 
to $37.4 billion in 2008. Revenue in 2009 included positive marks of 
$0.8 billion on subprime-related direct exposures. These positive revenues 
were partially offset by negative revenues of $1.5 billion on Alt-A mortgages, 
$0.8 billion of write-downs on commercial real estate, and a negative 
$1.6 billion CVA on the monoline insurers and fair value option liabilities. 
Revenue was also affected by negative marks on private equity positions and 
write-downs on highly leveraged finance commitments.Operating expenses decreased 8% in 2009, mainly driven by lower compensation and lower volumes and transaction expenses, partially offset 
by costs associated with the U.S. government loss-sharing agreement exited 
in the fourth quarter of 2009.Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased $1.6 billion, primarily driven by $4.5 billion in increased net credit losses, 
partially offset by a lower provision for loan losses and unfunded lending 
commitments of $2.9 billion.Assets declined 38% versus the prior year, primarily driven by amortization 
and prepayments, sales, marks and charge-offs.51The following table provides details of the composition of SAP assets as of December 31, 2010.Assets within Special Asset Pool as of December 31, 2010

TARP trust preferred securities and the exit from the loss-sharing agreement 
with the U.S. government, each in the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues also 
increased due to gains on sales of AFS securities, benefits from lower short-
term interest rates and other improved Treasury results during the current 
year. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the pretax gain 
related to Citi™s public and private exchange offers in 2009.Operating Expenses increased primarily due to various legal and related expenses, as well as other non-compensation expenses.2009 vs. 2008Revenues, net of interest expense declined primarily due to the pretax 
loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of TARP and the exit 
from the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government. Revenues also 
declined due to the absence of the 2008 sale of Citigroup Global Services 
Limited recorded in operations and technology. These declines were partially 
offset by a pretax gain related to the exchange offers, revenues and higher 
intersegment eliminations.Operating expenses increased primarily due to intersegment eliminations 
and increases in compensation, partially offset by lower repositioning reserves.54BALANCE SHEET REVIEWThe following sets forth a general discussion of the changes in certain of the more significant line items of Citi™s Consolidated Balance Sheet during 2010.

$1,914$573%Cash and Deposits with BanksCash and deposits with banks are composed of Cash and due from banks and Deposits with banks. Cash and due from banks includes (i) all currency and coin (both foreign and local currencies) in the possession of 
domestic and overseas offices of Citigroup, and (ii) non-interest-bearing 
balances due from banks, including non-interest-bearing demand deposit 
accounts with correspondent banks, central banks (such as the Federal 
Reserve Bank), and other banks or depository institutions for normal 
operating purposes. Deposits with banks includes interest-bearing balances, 
demand deposits and time deposits held in or due from banks (including 
correspondent banks, central banks and other banks or depository 
institutions) maintained for, among other things, normal operating purposes 

and regulatory reserve requirement purposes.During 2010, cash and deposits with banks decreased $3 billion, or 2%. The decrease is composed of a $5 billion, or 3%, decrease in Deposits with banks offset by a $3 billion, or 10%, increase in Cash and due from banks.LoansLoans include credit cards, mortgages, other real estate lending, personal 
loans, auto loans, student loans and corporate loans. Citigroup loans are 
reported in two categoriesŠConsumer and Corporate. These categories 
are classified according to the segment and sub-segment that manage the 
loans. As of December 31, 2010, Consumer and Corporate loans constituted 
71% and 29%, respectively, of Citi™s total loans (net of unearned income and 
before the allowance for loan losses).Consumer loans (net of allowance for loan losses) increased by $27
 billion, 
or 7%, during 2010. On January 1, 2010, approximately $120 billion of 

Consumer loans (primarily credit card receivables and student loans, net of 

$13 billion in allowance for loan loss reserves) were consolidated as a result of 

the adoption of SFAS 166/167. The increase in credit cards and student loans 

as a result of the adoption of SFAS 166/167 was partially offset by paydowns 

over the year on credit cards and the sale of The Student Loan Corporation. 

Also offsetting the increase was a $27 billion, or 12%, decrease in Consumer 

mortgage and real estate loans, driven by run-off, net credit losses and asset 

sales, as well as the sale of a Citigroup auto portfolio.Corporate loans (net of allowance for loan losses) increased by $26 billion, or 16%, during 2010, primarily due to the $28 billion of 
Corporate loans consolidated as of January 1, 2010 as a result of the 
adoption of SFAS 166/167. The majority of the loans consolidated were 

Citi-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits classified as loans 
to financial institutions. In addition, a $2 billion, or 32%, decrease in the 
allowance for loan loss reserves added to the increase of Corporate loans for 
the year. These increases were partially offset by the impact of a $7 billion, or 

21%, decrease in Corporate mortgage and real estate loans, primarily due to 
run-off and net credit losses.55During 2010, average Consumer loans (net of unearned income) of $495 billion yielded an average rate of 9.4%, compared to $456 billion and 7.8%, respectively, in the prior year. Average Corporate loans of $189 billion 

yielded an average rate of 4.5% during 2010, compared to $190 billion and 
6.3%, respectively, in the prior
 year.
For further information on Citi™s loan portfolios, see generally ﬁManaging 
Global RiskŠCredit Riskﬂ and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.Trading Account Assets and LiabilitiesTrading account assets includes debt and marketable equity securities, 
derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations and 
physical commodities inventory. In addition, certain assets that Citigroup has 
elected to carry at fair value, such as certain loans and purchase guarantees, 
are also included in Trading account assets. Trading account liabilities includes securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives 
in a net payable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup has 
elected to carry at fair value.During 2010, Trading account assets
 decreased by $26 billion, or 8%, primarily due to decreases in debt securities ($17 billion, or 53%), derivative 
assets ($9 billion, or 15%), equity securities ($8 billion, or 17%) and U.S. 
Treasury and federal agency securities ($7 billion, or 24%), partially offset 

by a $16 billion, or 21%, increase in foreign government securities. Average 

Trading account assets
 were $337 billion in 2010, compared to $350 billion 
in 2009.During 2010, Trading account liabilities
 decreased by $9 billion, or 7%, primarily due to a $4 billion, or 7%, decrease in derivative liabilities, 
and a $4 billion, or 6%, decrease in securities short positions (primarily 
U.S. Treasury securities). In 2010, average 
Trading account liabilities
 were 
$128 billion, compared to $139 billion in 2009.For further information on Citi™s 
Trading account assets
 and Trading 
account liabilities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Federal Funds Sold (Purchased) and Securities  
Borrowed (Loaned) or Purchased (Sold) Under 
Agreements to Resell (Repurchase)Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities 
lending transactions generally do not constitute a sale of the underlying 
securities for accounting purposes and, as such, are treated as collateralized 
financing transactions. Similarly, securities purchased under agreements to 
resell (reverse repos) and securities borrowing transactions generally do not 
constitute a purchase of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and so are treated as collateralized lending transactions. Reverse repos and 
securities borrowing transactions increased by $25 billion, or 11%, during 
2010. For further information on repos and securities lending transactions, 
see ﬁCapital Resources and LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ below.Federal funds sold and federal funds purchased consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at the Federal Reserve Banks to and from third parties. During 2009 and 2010, Citi™s federal funds 

sold and federal funds purchased were not significant.For further information regarding these balance sheet categories, see Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.InvestmentsInvestments consists of debt and equity securities that are available-for-sale, 
debt securities that are held-to-maturity, non-marketable equity securities 
that are carried at fair value, and non-marketable equity securities carried at 
cost. Debt securities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as 
well as certain loan-backed securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) 
and other structured notes. Marketable and non-marketable equity securities 
carried at fair value include common and nonredeemable preferred stock. 
Non-marketable equity securities carried at cost primarily include equity 
shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Banks 
that Citigroup is required to hold.During 2010, investments increased by $12 billion, or 4%, primarily due to a $34 billion, or 14%, increase in available-for-sale (predomina
ntly U.S. 
Treasury and federal agency securities), offset by a $22 billion decrease in 

held-to-maturity securities (predominantly asset-backed and mortgage-
backed securities).For further information regarding Investments, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other AssetsOther assets consists of Brokerage receivables, Goodwill, Intangibles and Mortgage servicing rights in addition to Other assets as presented on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet (including, among other items, loans held-
for-sale, deferred tax assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees 
receivable, premises and equipment, end-user derivatives in a net receivable 
position, repossessed assets, and other receivables). During 2010, Other assets decreased $4 billion, or 2%, primarily due to a $2 billion decrease in 
brokerage receivables, a $2 billion decrease in mortgage servicing rights 
and a $1 billion decrease in intangible assets, partially offset by a $1 billion 
increase in goodwill and a $1 billion increase in other assets.56For further information regarding Goodwill and Intangible assets, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on Brokerage receivables, see Note 13 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.DepositsDeposits represent customer funds that are payable on demand or 
upon maturity. For a discussion of deposits, see ﬁCapital Resources and 
LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ below.DebtDebt is composed of both short-term and long-term borrowings. Long-term 
borrowings include senior notes, subordinated notes, trust preferred securities 
and securitizations. Short-term borrowings include commercial paper and 
borrowings from unaffiliated banks and other market participants. During 
2010, total debt increased by $27 billion, or 6%, including the consolidation 
of securitizations as a result of the adoption of SFAS 166/167 effective 
January 1, 2010. Absent the impact of SFAS 166/167, total debt decreased by 
$57 billion, or 13%. For further information on long-term and short-term 
debt, see ﬁCapital Resources and LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ below 
and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other LiabilitiesOther liabilities consists of Brokerage payables and Other liabilities as 
presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (including, among other 
items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities, end-user 
derivatives in a net payable position, and reserves for legal claims, taxes, 
restructuring reserves for unfunded lending commitments, and other 
matters). During 2010, Other liabilities decreased $17 billion, or 12%, 
primarily due to a $9 billion decrease in brokerage payables and a $7 billion 
decrease in other liabilities.For further information regarding

consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reporting segment as of December 31, 2010. The respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities 
managed by each segment as of such date. While this presentation is not 
defined by GAAP, Citi believes that these non-GAAP financial measures 

enhance investors™ understanding of the balance sheet components 
managed by the underlying business segments, as well as the beneficial 
inter-relationship of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet 

components among Citi™s business segments.
58CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYCAPITAL RESOURCESOverviewCiti generates capital through earnings from its operating businesses. However, Citi may augment, and during the financial crisis did augment, 
its capital through issuances of common stock, convertible preferred stock, 

preferred stock and equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans. 

Citi also augmented its regulatory capital through the issuance of subordinated 

debt underlying trust preferred securities, although the treatment of such 

instruments as regulatory capital will be phased out under Basel III and the 

Financial Reform Act (see ﬁRegulatory Capital Standards Developmentsﬂ 

and ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below). Further, the impact of future events on Citi™s 

business results, such as corporate and asset dispositions, as well as changes in 

regulatory and accounting standards, also affects Citi™s capital levels.Capital is used primarily to support assets in Citi™s businesses and to 
absorb market, credit or operational losses. While capital may be used for 
other purposes, such as to pay dividends or repurchase common stock, Citi™s 

ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently restricted due to, 
among other things, its agreements with certain U.S. government entities, 
generally for so long as the U.S. government continues to hold any Citi 
trust preferred securities acquired in connection with the exchange offers 
consummated in 2009. See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below.
Citigroup™s capital management framework is designed to ensure that 
Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent 
with Citi™s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines, 

as well as external rating agency considerations. Senior management is 
responsible for the capital management process mainly through Citigroup™s 

Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO), with oversight from 
the Risk Management and Finance Committee of Citigroup™s Board of 

Directors. FinALCO is composed of the senior-most management of Citigroup 

for the purpose of engaging management in decision-making and related 
discussions on capital and liquidity matters. Among other things, FinALCO™s 

responsibilities include: determining the financial structure of Citigroup and 
its principal subsidiaries; ensuring that Citigroup and its regulated entities 
are adequately capitalized in consultation with its regulators; determining 
appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for Citigroup and individual 
businesses; reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for Citigroup; 
and setting and monitoring corporate and bank liquidity levels, and the 
impact of currency translation on non-U.S. capital.Capital RatiosCitigroup is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board. Historically, capital adequacy has been measured, in part, 
based on two risk-based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital 
(Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of the sum of 
ﬁcore capital elements,ﬂ such as qualifying common stockholders™ equity, 
as adjusted, qualifying noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily 
redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts, principally reduced by goodwill, 
other disallowed intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. Total 
Capital also includes ﬁsupplementaryﬂ Tier 2 Capital elements, such as 
qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit 
losses. Both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-
weighted assets.In 2009, the U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of capital termed ﬁTier 1 Common,ﬂ which is defined as Tier 1 Capital less non-

common elements, including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying 
noncontrolling interests, and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities 
of subsidiary trusts. For more detail on all of these capital metrics, see 
ﬁComponents of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelinesﬂ below.
Citigroup™s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application 
of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit 
risk. Pursuant to these guidelines, on-balance-sheet assets and the credit 
equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures (such as 
financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit, and 
derivatives) are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories 
based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor, or if relevant, 

the guarantor, the nature of the collateral, or external credit ratings. 

Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered 
trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity positions 
whether or not carried in the trading account. Excluded from risk-weighted 
assets are any assets, such as goodwill and deferred tax assets, to the extent 
required to be deducted from regulatory capital. See ﬁComponents of Capital 
Under Regulatory Guidelinesﬂ below.
Citigroup is also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a 

percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets.To be ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under current federal bank regulatory agency 
definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 

at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage ratio of at 

least 3%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain 
higher capital levels. The following table sets forth Citigroup™s regulatory 

capital ratios as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.59Citigroup Regulatory Capital RatiosAt year end2010

60Adoption of SFAS 166/167 Impact on CapitalAs previously disclosed and as described further in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the adoption of SFAS 166/167 resulted in the 
consolidation of $137 billion of incremental assets and $146 billion of 
liabilities, including securitized credit card receivables, onto Citigroup™s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet on the date of adoption, as of January 1, 2010. 
The adoption of SFAS 166/167 also resulted in a net increase of $10 billion 
in risk-weighted assets. In addition, Citi added $13.4 billion to the loan 
loss allowance, increased deferred tax assets by $5.0 billion, and reduced 
retained earnings by $8.4 billion. This translated into a decrease in Tier 1 
Common, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital of $14.2 billion, $14.2 billion 
and $14.0 billion, respectively, and a reduction in Tangible Common Equity 
(described below) of $8.4 billion.The impact on Citigroup™s capital ratios from the January 1, 2010 
adoption of SFAS 166/167 was as follows:

and Intangible assets (other than Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)), net 
of the related net deferred taxes. Other companies may calculate TCE in a 
manner different from that of Citigroup. Citi™s TCE was $129.4 billion at 
December 31, 2010 and $118.2 billion at December 31, 2009.The TCE ratio (TCE divided by risk-weighted assets) was 13.2% at December 31, 2010 and 10.9% at December 31, 2009.TCE is a capital adequacy metric used and relied upon by industry analysts; however, it is a non-GAAP financial measure for SEC purposes.

61Capital Resources of Citigroup™s Depository InstitutionsCitigroup™s U.S. subsidiary depository institutions are also subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank 
regulatory agencies, which are similar to the guidelines of the Federal 
Reserve Board. To be ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under current regulatory definitions, 
Citigroup™s depository institutions must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 
6%, a Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital + Tier 2 Capital) ratio of at least 10%, and 
a Leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a regulatory directive to 
meet and maintain higher capital levels.At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, all of Citigroup™s U.S. 
subsidiary depository institutions including Citigroup™s primary subsidiary 

depository institution, Citibank, N.A., were ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ under current 
federal bank regulatory agency definitions, as noted in the following table:Citibank, N.A. Components of Capital and Ratios Under

and its non-bank subsidiaries. In determining the declaration of dividends, 
each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-
based capital and Leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements 
of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations 
should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Citigroup 
did not receive any dividends from its bank subsidiaries during 2010. See also 
ﬁFunding and LiquidityŠLiquidity Transfer Between Entitiesﬂ below.
62Impact of Changes on Capital RatiosThe following table presents the estimated sensitivity of Citigroup™s and Citibank, N.A.™s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in Tier 1 Common, 
Tier 1 Capital, or Total Capital (numerator), or changes of $1 billion in 
risk-weighted assets or adjusted average total assets (denominator), based on 
financial information as of December 31, 2010. This information is provided Broker-Dealer SubsidiariesAt December 31, 2010, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a broker-dealer 
registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of 
Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., had net capital, computed in 
accordance with the SEC™s net capital rule, of $8.9 billion, which exceeded 
the minimum requirement by $8.2 billion.In addition, certain of Citi™s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to 
regulation in the other countries in which they do business, including 
requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. 
Citigroup™s broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital 

requirements at December 31, 2010.for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup™s or 
Citibank, N.A.™s financial position or results of operations could have on these 
ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component 
of capital, risk-weighted assets, or adjusted average total assets. Accordingly,

63Regulatory Capital Standards DevelopmentsThe prospective regulatory capital standards for financial institutions are currently subject to significant debate, rulemaking activity and uncertainty, 
both in the U.S. and internationally. See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below.Basel II and III. In late 2005, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) published a new set of risk-based 
capital standards (Basel II) that would permit banking organizations, 
including Citigroup, to leverage internal risk models used to measure 
credit, operational, and market risk exposures to drive regulatory capital 
calculations. In late 2007, the U.S. banking agencies adopted these standards 
for large banking organizations, including Citigroup. As adopted, the 
standards require Citigroup, as a large and internationally active banking 
organization, to comply with the most advanced Basel II approaches for 
calculating credit and operational risk capital requirements. The U.S. 
implementation timetable consists of a parallel calculation period under the 
current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and Basel II, followed by a three-
year transitional period.Citi began parallel reporting on April 1, 2010. There will be at least four quarters of parallel reporting before Citi enters the three-year transitional 
period. The U.S. banking agencies have reserved the right to change how 
Basel II is applied in the U.S. following a review at the end of the second year 
of the transitional period, and to retain the existing prompt corrective action 
and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in 
the U.S.Apart from the Basel II rules regarding credit and operational risks, in June 2010, the Basel Committee agreed on certain revisions to the market risk 

capital framework that would also result in additional capital requirements. 
In December 2010, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal that would 
amend their market risk capital rules to implement certain revisions 
approved by the Basel Committee to the market risk capital framework.Further, as an outgrowth of the financial crisis, in December 2010, 
the Basel Committee issued final rules to strengthen existing capital 
requirements (Basel III). The U.S. banking agencies will be required 
to finalize, within two years, the rules to be applied by U.S. banking 
organizations commencing on January 1, 2013.Under Basel III, when fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Citigroup would be required to maintain risk-based capital ratios as follows:Tier 1 Common
Tier 1 Capital
Total Capital




While banking organizations may draw on the 2.5% capital conservation buffer to absorb losses during periods of financial or economic stress, restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g., dividends, equity repurchases, and 
discretionary compensation) would result, with the degree of such restrictions 
greater based upon the extent to which the buffer is utilized. Moreover, 

subject to national discretion by the respective bank supervisory or regulatory 
authorities, a countercyclical capital buffer ranging from 0% to 2.5%, 
consisting of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital, would 
also be imposed on banking organizations when it is deemed that excess 
aggregate credit growth is resulting in a build-up of systemic risk in a given 
country. This countercyclical capital buffer, when in effect, would serve as an 

additional buffer supplementing the capital conservation buffer.
As a systemically important financial institution, Citigroup may also be subject to additional capital requirements. The Basel Committee and 
the Financial Stability Board are currently developing an integrated 
approach to systemically important financial institutions that could include 
combinations of capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt.Under Basel III, Tier 1 Common capital will be required to be measured 
after applying generally all regulatory adjustments (including applicable 
deductions). The impact of these regulatory adjustments on Tier 1 Common 

capital would be phased in incrementally at 20% annually beginning on 
January 1, 2014, with full implementation by January 1, 2018. During the 
transition period, the portion of the regulatory adjustments (including 
applicable deductions) not applied against Tier 1 Common capital would 

continue to be subject to existing national treatments.Moreover, under Basel III certain capital instruments will no longer qualify 
as non-common components of Tier 1 Capital (e.g., trust preferred securities 

and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) or Tier 2 Capital. These instruments 

will be subject to a 10% per-year phase-out over 10 years beginning on January 

1, 2013, except for certain limited grandfathering. This phase-out period 

will be substantially shorter in the U.S. as a result of the so-called ﬁCollins 

Amendmentﬂ to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act of 2010, which will generally require a phase out of these securities over 

a three-year period also beginning on January 1, 2013. In addition, the Basel 

Committee has subsequently issued supplementary minimum requirements to 

those contained in Basel III, which must be met or exceeded in order to ensure 

that qualifying non-common Tier 1 or Tier 2 Capital instruments fully absorb 

losses at the point of a banking organization™s non-viability before taxpayers are 

exposed to loss. These requirements must be reflected within the terms of the 

capital instruments unless, subject to certain conditions, they are implemented 

through the governing jurisdiction™s legal framework.
Although U.S. banking organizations, such as Citigroup, are currently subject to a supplementary, non-risk-based measure of leverage for capital 

adequacy purposes (see ﬁCapital Ratiosﬂ above), Basel III establishes a more 
constrained Leverage ratio requirement. Initially, during a four-year parallel 

run beginning on January 1, 2013, banking organizations will be required 
to maintain a minimum 3% Tier 1 Capital Leverage ratio. Disclosure of such 

ratio, and its components, will start on January 1, 2015. Depending upon the 
results of the parallel run test period, there could be subsequent adjustments 
to the definition and calibration of the Leverage ratio, which is to be finalized 
in 2017 and become a formal requirement by January 1, 2018.64FUNDING AND LIQUIDITYOverviewCiti™s funding and liquidity objective is to both fund its existing asset base and maintain sufficient excess liquidity so that it can operate under a wide 
variety of market conditions. An extensive range of liquidity scenarios is considered based on both historical industry experience and hypothetical 
situations. The approach is to ensure Citi has sufficient funding that is 
structural in nature so as to accommodate market disruptions for both 
short- and long-term periods. Due to various constraints that limit the free 
transfer of liquidity or capital between Citi-affiliated entities (as discussed 
below), Citigroup™s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and 
in aggregate, across:(i)  the non-bank, which is largely comprised of the parent holding 
company (Citigroup), Citigroup Funding Inc. (CFI) and Citi™s broker-

dealer subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this section as ﬁnon-
bankﬂ); and(ii)  Citi™s bank subsidiaries, such as Citibank, N.A.
At an aggregate level, Citigroup™s goal is to ensure that there is sufficient 
funding in amount and tenor to ensure that aggregate liquidity resources  are available for these entities. The liquidity framework requires that entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity in their designated stress tests 
and have excess cash capital (as further discussed in ﬁLiquidity Measures and Stress Testingﬂ below).
The primary sources of funding include (i) deposits via Citi™s bank 
subsidiaries, which are Citi™s most stable and lowest-cost source of long-

term funding, (ii) long-term debt (including trust preferred securities and 
other long-term collateralized financing) issued at the non-bank level 
and certain bank subsidiaries, and (iii) stockholders™ equity. These sources 

are supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of 
commercial paper and secured financing (securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase) at the non-bank level.Citigroup works to ensure that the structural tenor of these funding sources is sufficiently long in relation to the tenor of its asset base. In fact, 
the key goal of Citi™s asset-liability management is to ensure that there is 

excess tenor in the liability structure so as to provide excess liquidity to fund 
the assets. The excess liquidity resulting from a longer-term tenor profile can 

effectively offset potential downward pressures on liquidity that may occur 
under stress. This excess funding is held in the form of aggregate liquidity 
resources, as described below.

$86.8 billion at December 31, 2009. This includes the liquidity portfolio and 
ﬁcash boxﬂ held in the United States as well as government bonds held by 
Citigroup™s broker-dealer entities in the United Kingdom and Japan. 
Citigroup™s bank subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 
$82.1 billion of cash on deposit with major central banks (including the 
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Swiss 
National Bank, Bank of Japan, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and 
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) at December 31, 2010, compared with 
$79.1 billion at September 30, 2010 and $105.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Citigroup™s bank subsidiaries also have significant additional liquidity 
resources through unencumbered highly liquid government and 
government-backed securities. These securities are available for sale or 
secured funding through private markets or by pledging to the major central 
banks. The liquidity value of these liquid securities was $145.3 billion at 
December 31, 2010, compared with $161.7 billion at September 30, 2010 and 
$123.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Significant amounts of cash and liquid 
securities are also available in other Citigroup entities.In addition to the highly liquid securities noted above, Citigroup™s bank 
subsidiaries also maintain additional unencumbered securities and loans, 
which are currently pledged to the U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks™ (FHLB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank™s discount window.
65DepositsCiti continues to focus on maintaining a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base that stood at $845 billion at December 31, 2010, 
as compared with $836 billion at December 31, 2009 and $850 billion 
at September 30, 2010. The $9 billion increase in deposits year over year 
was largely due to FX translation and higher deposit volumes in Regional Consumer Banking and Transaction Services. These increases were 
partially offset by a decrease in Securities and Banking and Citi Holdings™ 
deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, deposits decreased modestly by 
$5 billion due primarily to lower balances in Securities and Banking and Citi Holdings, partially offset by increases in FX translation and higher 
deposit volumes in Regional Consumer Banking. Citigroup™s deposits are diversified across clients, products and regions, with 
approximately 64% outside of the United States as of December 31, 2010. Deposits 
can be interest bearing or non-interest bearing. As of December 31, 2010, interest-
bearing deposits payable by Citigroup™s 
foreign and domestic banking subsidiaries 

constituted 58% and 27% of total deposits, respectively, while non-interest-bearing 

deposits constituted 7% and 9%, respectively.Long-Term Debt Long-term debt is an important funding source because of its multi-year 
maturity structure. At December 31, 2010, long-term debt outstanding for 
Citigroup was as follows: In billions of dollarsNon-bankBankTotal

66Absent the impact of consolidating securitizations under SFAS 166/167, 
which increased long-term debt by approximately $70 billion, long-term debt decreased by $53 billion from $364 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $311 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The $53 billion decrease (excluding securitizations) was driven by approximately $79 billion of redemptions, maturities and business sales, which was partially offset by 
approximately $29 billion of issuances during the year, with the remainder 

primarily attributable to FX translation and fair value.As noted in the table above, during 2010 Citi issued approximately one-quarter of the amount of long-term debt it issued in 2009. Moreover, the 

status of Citi™s liquidity resources and asset reductions in Citi Holdings during 

2010 prompted less of a need to fully refinance long-term debt maturities. 
Citi refinanced approximately $22 billion, or slightly more than half, of 
the approximate $40 billion long-term debt that matured during 2010 
(excluding local country, securitizations and FHLB).The table below shows the aggregate annual maturities of Citi™s long-term debt obligations:Long-term debt maturities by year In billions of dollars 20112012201320142015ThereafterTotal

Long-Term Debt Funding OutlookCiti currently estimates its long-term debt maturing during 2011 to be approximately $41 billion (which excludes maturities relating to local 
country, securitizations and FHLB), of which approximately $20.3 billion is 
TLGP debt. Given the current status of its liquidity resources and continued 
reductions of assets in Citi Holdings, Citi currently expects to refinance 
approximately $20 billion of long-term debt during 2011. Citi does not 
expect to refinance its TLGP debt as it matures either during 2011 or 2012 
(approximately $38 billion). Citi continues to review its funding and liquidity 

needs, and may adjust its expected issuances due to market conditions or 
regulatory requirements, among other factors.  Federal funds purchased

Secured Financing and Short-Term BorrowingsAs referenced above, Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with 
short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings generally include (i) secured 
financing (securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase) and 
(ii) short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings 
from banks and other market participants. As required by SEC rules, the 
following table contains the year-end, average and maximum month-end 
amounts for the following respective short-term borrowing categories at the 
end of each of the three prior fiscal years.67Secured financing is primarily conducted through Citi™s broker-dealer 
subsidiaries to facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion of the trading inventory. Secured financing appears as a 

liability on Citi™s Consolidated Balance Sheet (ﬁSecurities Loaned or Sold 

Under Agreements to Repurchaseﬂ). As of December 31, 2010, secured 
financing was $189.6 billion and averaged approximately $207 billion 
during the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Secured financing at 
December 31, 2010 increased by $35 billion from $154.3 billion at 
December 31, 2009. During the same period, reverse repos and securities 
borrowing increased by $25 billion. The majority of secured financing is collateralized by highly liquid government, government-backed and government agency securities. This 
collateral comes primarily from Citi™s trading assets and its secured lending, 

and is part of Citi™s client matched-book activity given that Citi both borrows 

and lends similar asset types on a secured basis.The minority of secured financing is collateralized by less liquid collateral, and supports both Citi™s trading assets as well as the business of 

secured lending to customers, which is also part of Citi™s client matched-book 

activity. The less liquid secured borrowing is carefully calibrated by asset 

quality, tenor and counterparty exposure, including those that might be 

sensitive to ratings stresses, in order to increase the reliability of the funding. Citi believes there are several potential mitigants available to it in the event of stress on the secured financing markets for less liquid collateral. 
Citi™s significant liquidity resources in its non-bank entities as of December 

31, 2010, supplemented by collateralized liquidity transfers between entities, 
provide a cushion. Within the matched-book activity, the secured lending 

positions, which are carefully managed in terms of collateral and tenor, 

could be unwound to provide additional liquidity under stress. Citi also has excess funding capacity for less liquid collateral with existing counterparties 
that can be accessed during potential dislocation. In addition, Citi has the ability to adjust the size of select trading books to provide further mitigation.At December 31, 2010, commercial paper outstanding for Citigroup™s non-
bank entities and bank subsidiaries, respectively, was as follows:

Other short-term borrowings of approximately $54 billion (as set forth in the Secured Financing and Short-Term Borrowings table above) include 

$42.4 billion of borrowings from banks and other market participants, which 
includes borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks. This represented 
a decrease of approximately $11 billion as compared to year-end 2009. The 

average balance of borrowings from banks and other market participants 
for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $43 billion. 
Other short-term borrowings also include $11.7 billion of broker borrowings 
at December 31, 2010, which averaged approximately $13 billion for the 
quarter ended December 31, 2010. See Notes 12 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Citigroup™s and its affiliates™ outstanding long-term debt and 

short-term borrowings.Liquidity Transfer Between EntitiesLiquidity is generally transferable within the non-bank, subject to regulatory 
restrictions (if any) and standard legal terms. Similarly, the non-bank 
can generally transfer excess liquidity into Citi™s bank subsidiaries, such as 
Citibank, N.A. In addition, Citigroup™s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, 
N.A., can lend to the Citigroup parent and broker-dealer in accordance with 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of December 31, 2010, the amount 
available for lending under Section 23A was approximately $26.6 billion, 
provided the funds are collateralized appropriately.68Liquidity Risk ManagementCitigroup runs a centralized treasury model where the overall balance sheet is managed by Citigroup Treasury through Global Franchise Treasurers 
and Regional Treasurers. Day-to-day liquidity and funding are managed by 
treasurers at the country and business level and are monitored by Corporate 
Treasury and Citi risk management. Liquidity management is the responsibility of senior management through Citigroup™s Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO) 

and is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Risk Management 
and Finance Committee. Asset and liability committees are also established 
globally and for each region, country and/or major line of business.Liquidity Measures and Stress TestingCiti uses multiple measures in monitoring its liquidity, including liquidity 
ratios, stress testing and liquidity limits, each as described below. In broad terms, the structural liquidity ratio, defined as the sum of deposits, long-term debt and stockholders™ equity as a percentage of total 
assets, measures whether the asset base is funded by sufficiently long-dated 
liabilities. Citi™s structural liquidity ratio was 73% at December 31, 2010, 71% 

at September 30, 2010, and 73% at December 31, 2009.Another measure of Citi™s structural liquidity is cash capital. Cash capital 
is a more detailed measure of the ability to fund the structurally illiquid 
portion of Citigroup™s balance sheet. Cash capital measures the amount of 

long-term fundingŠor core customer deposits, long-term debt (over one 
year) and equityŠavailable to fund illiquid assets. Illiquid assets generally 
include loans (net of securitization adjustments), securities haircuts and 
other assets (i.e., goodwill, intangibles, fixed assets). At December 31, 2010, 
both the non-bank and the aggregate bank subsidiaries had a significant 
excess of cash capital. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, the non-bank 
maintained liquidity to meet all maturing obligations significantly in excess 
of a one-year period without access to the unsecured wholesale markets.Liquidity stress testing is performed for each major entity, operating 
subsidiary and/or country. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended 

to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the balance sheet 
and liquidity position, and to identify viable funding alternatives that can 
be utilized. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes 
in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential 
uses of funding and political and economic conditions in certain countries. 
These conditions include standard and stressed market conditions as well as 
firm-specific events.A wide range of liquidity stress tests are important for monitoring purposes. Some span liquidity events over a full year, some may cover an 

intense stress period of one month, and still other time frames may be 
appropriate. These potential liquidity events are useful to ascertain potential 
mis-matches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of horizons 
(overnight, one week, two week, one month, three month, one year), and 
liquidity limits are set accordingly. To monitor the liquidity of a unit, 

those stress tests and potential mismatches may be calculated with varying 
frequencies, with several important tests performed daily. 
Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains a series of Contingency Funding Plans on a consolidated basis as well as for individual 
entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily available actions that 
are available in a variety of adverse market conditions, or idiosyncratic disruptions. Credit Ratings Citigroup™s ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, as 
well as the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits, is 
dependent on its credit ratings. The table below indicates the current ratings 
for Citigroup and Citibank, N.A.Citigroup™s Debt Ratings as of December 31, 2010 Citigroup Inc./Citigroup  Funding Inc. (1)Citibank, N.A.

69Each of the credit rating agencies is evaluating the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Financial 
Reform Act) on the rating support assumptions currently included in their 
methodologies, as related to large U.S. bank holdings companies (see 
also ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ below). It is their belief that the Financial Reform Act 
increases the uncertainty regarding the U.S. government™s willingness to 

provide support to large bank holding companies in the future. Consistent 
with this belief, and their actions with respect to other large U.S. banks, both 
S&P and Moody™s revised their outlooks on Citigroup™s supported ratings from 

stable to negative, and Fitch placed Citigroup™s supported ratings on rating 

watch negative, during 2010. The ultimate timing of the completion of the 
credit rating agencies™ evaluations of the impact of the Financial Reform Act, 
as well as the outcomes, is uncertain.Also in 2010, however, Citi™s unsupported ratings were improved at two of 
the three agencies listed above. In both the first quarter and fourth quarter of 
2010, S&P upgraded Citi™s stand alone credit profile, or unsupported rating, 

by one notch, for a total two-notch upgrade during 2010. In the fourth 
quarter of 2010, Fitch upgraded Citi™s unsupported rating by a notch. Further, 

Fitch stated that as long as Citi™s intrinsic performance and fundamental 

credit profile remain stable or improve, any future lowering or elimination 
of government support from its ratings would still result in a long-term 
unsupported rating in the ﬁAﬂ category, and short-term unsupported rating of at least ﬁF1.ﬂ Citi believes these upgrades were based on its progress to 
date, and such upgrades have narrowed the gap between Citi™s supported and 

unsupported ratings. Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody™s or S&P could have material 
impacts on funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding 
capacity, and due to collateral triggers. Because of the current credit ratings of Citigroup, a one-notch downgrade of its senior debt/long-term rating 
may or may not impact Citigroup™s commercial paper/short-term rating by 

one notch. As of December 31, 2010, Citi currently believes that a one-notch downgrade of both the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup and a one-
notch downgrade of Citigroup™s commercial paper/short-term rating could 

result in the assumed loss of unsecured commercial paper ($8.9 billion) and 
tender option bonds funding ($0.3 billion), as well as derivative triggers and 
additional margin requirements ($1.0 billion). Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing and other margin requirements for which there are no 
explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected. The aggregate liquidity resources of Citigroup™s non-bank stood at 
$95 billion as of December 31, 2010, in part as a contingency for such an 
event, and a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in 
Citigroup™s Contingency Funding Plans (as described under ﬁLiquidity 

Measures and Stress Testingﬂ above). These mitigating factors include, but 

are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients, 
tailoring levels of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading books, 
and collateralized borrowings from significant bank subsidiaries.  Citi currently believes that a more severe ratings downgrade scenario, such 
as a two-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of Citigroup, 
accompanied by a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup™s commercial paper/

short-term rating, could result in an additional $1.2 billion in funding 
requirement in the form of cash obligations and collateral. Further, as of December 31, 2010, a one-notch downgrade of the senior 
debt/long-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. could result in an approximate 
$4.6 billion funding requirement in the form of collateral and cash 
obligations. Because of the current credit ratings of Citibank, N.A., a one-
notch downgrade of its senior debt/long-term rating is unlikely to have any 
impact on its commercial paper/short-term rating. The significant bank 
entities, Citibank, N.A., and other bank vehicles have aggregate liquidity 
resources of $227 billion, and have detailed contingency funding plans that encompass a broad range of mitigating actions.70CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table includes information on Citigroup™s contractual obligations, as specified and aggregated pursuant to SEC requirements. Purchase obligations consist of those obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Citi. For presentation 
purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table below through 
the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is 
renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include 
clauses that would allow Citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified 
notice; however, that impact is not included in the table below (unless 

Citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate 
the agreement). Other liabilities reflected on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet 
include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, 
uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will 
ultimately be paid in cash. Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally short-
term in nature, including deposits and securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase (see ﬁCapital Resources and LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ above for a discussion of these obligations). The table also excludes certain 
insurance and investment contracts subject to mortality and morbidity 
risks or without defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and 
withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to these insurance and 
investment contracts are included as Other liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.Contractual obligations by yearIn millions of dollars at December 31, 2010

71RISK FACTORSThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 will require 
Citigroup to restructure or change certain of its business 
practices and potentially reduce revenues or otherwise 
limit its profitability, including by imposing additional 
costs on Citigroup, some of which may be significant. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 
(Financial Reform Act), signed into law on July 21, 2010, calls for significant 
structural reforms and new substantive regulation across the financial 
industry. Because most of the provisions of the Financial Reform Act that 
could particularly impact Citi are currently or will be subject to extensive 
rulemaking and interpretation, a significant amount of uncertainty remains 
as to the ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on Citigroup, especially 
when combined with other ongoing U.S. and global regulatory developments. 
This uncertainty impedes future planning with respect to certain of Citi™s 
businesses and, combined with the extensive and comprehensive regulatory 
requirements adopted and implemented in compressed time frames, 
presents operational and compliance costs and risks. What is certain is that 
the Financial Reform Act will require Citigroup to restructure, transform 
or change certain of its business activities and practices, potentially limit 
or eliminate Citi™s ability to pursue business opportunities, and impose 

additional costs, some significant, on Citigroup, each of which could 
negatively impact, possibly significantly, Citigroup™s earnings. 
Increases in FDIC insurance premiums will significantly increase Citi™s required premiums, which will negatively 
impact Citigroup™s earnings.
The FDIC maintains a fund out of which it covers losses on insured deposits. 
The fund is composed of assessments on financial institutions that hold 
FDIC-insured deposits, including Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup™s other 
FDIC-insured depository institutions. As a result of the recent financial 
crisis, the Financial Reform Act seeks to put the FDIC fund on a sounder 
financial footing by requiring that the fund have assets equal to at least 
1.35% of insurable deposits. The FDIC has adopted a higher target of 2.0% of 
insurable deposits. The cost of FDIC assessments to FDIC-insured depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup™s other FDIC-insured depository 

institutions, depends on the assessment rate and the assessment base of each 
institution. The Financial Reform Act changed the assessment base from 
the amount of U.S. domestic deposits to the amount of worldwide average 
consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. The FDIC has adopted 

a complex set of calculation rules for its assessment rate, to be effective 
in the second quarter of 2011. As a result of these changes, Citigroup™s 

FDIC assessments could increase significantly (prior to any potential 
mitigating actions), which will negatively impact its earnings. Given 
Citi™s substantial global footprint, the change from an assessment based 

on Citigroup™s relatively smaller U.S. deposit base, as compared to its U.S. 

competitors, to one related to global assets (including Citigroup™s relatively 

larger global deposit base as compared to its U.S. competitors) will cause a disproportionate increase in Citigroup™s assessment base relative to many of 

its U.S. competitors that are subject to the FDIC assessment. The assessment 
could also disadvantage Citi™s competitive position in relation to foreign local 

banks which are not subject to the assessment. Although Citigroup currently believes it is ﬁwell capitalized,ﬂ prospective regulatory capital requirements 
for financial institutions are uncertain and Citi™s 
capitalization may not prove to be sufficient relative to 
future requirements.
The prospective regulatory capital standards for financial institutions are 
currently subject to significant debate and rulemaking activity, both in the 
U.S. and internationally, resulting in a degree of uncertainty as to their 
ultimate scope and effect.As an outgrowth of the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) has established global financial reforms 
designed, in part, to strengthen existing capital requirements (Basel III). 
Under Basel III, when fully phased in, Citigroup would be subject to stated 
minimum capital ratio requirements for Tier 1 Common of 4.5%, for Tier 1 

Capital of 6.0%, and for Total Capital of 8.0%. Further, the new standards 

also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, and potentially also a 
countercyclical capital buffer, above these stated minimum requirements 

for each of these three capital tiers. Apart from risk-based capital, Basel III 
also introduced a more constrained Leverage ratio requirement than that 
currently imposed on U.S. banking organizations. For more information on 

Basel III and other requirements and proposals relating to capital adequacy, 

see ﬁCapital ResourcesŠRegulatory Capital Standards Developmentsﬂ above. 
Even though Citigroup continues to be ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ in accordance with current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, with a Tier 1 Capital 

ratio of 12.9%, a Total Capital ratio of 16.6%, and a Leverage ratio of 6.6%, 

as well as a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.8%, each as of December 31, 2010, 

Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital consistent with 
Basel III and other future regulatory capital requirements. Because the rules 
relating to the U.S. implementation of Basel III and other future regulatory 
capital requirements are not entirely certain, Citigroup™s ability to comply 

with these requirements on a timely basis depends upon certain assumptions, 
including, for instance, those with respect to Citigroup™s 
significant 
investments in unconsolidated financial entities (such as the Morgan Stanley 
Smith Barney joint venture), the size of Citigroup™s deferred tax assets and 

MSRs, and its internal risk calibration models. If any of these assumptions 
proves to be incorrect, it could negatively affect Citigroup™s ability to comply 

in a timely manner with these future regulatory capital requirements.In addition, the Financial Reform Act grants new regulatory authority to various U.S. federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and a 
newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council, to impose heightened 
prudential standards on financial institutions that pose a systemic risk 
to market-wide financial stability (Citigroup will be defined as such an 
institution under the Financial Reform Act). These standards include 
heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards, as well as requirements 72for periodic stress tests (the first round of which is in the process of being implemented). The Federal Reserve Board may also impose other prudential 
standards, including contingent capital requirements, based upon its 
authority to distinguish among bank holding companies such as Citigroup 
in relation to their perceived riskiness, complexity, activities, size and other 

factors. The exact nature of these future requirements remains uncertain. Further, the so-called ﬁCollins Amendmentﬂ 
reflected in the Financial Reform Act will result in new minimum capital requirements for bank 
holding companies such as Citigroup, and provides for the phase-out of trust 
preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 Capital for 

regulatory capital purposes, beginning   
January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup had approximately $15.4 billion in outstanding trust 
preferred securities that will be subject to the provisions of the Collins 
Amendment. As a result, Citigroup may need to replace certain of its existing 
Tier 1 Capital with new capital. 
Accordingly, Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital 
in light of the changing and uncertain regulatory capital requirements 
resulting from the Financial Reform Act, the Basel Committee, and U.S. or 
international regulators, or Citigroup™s costs to maintain such capital levels 

may increase. Changes in regulation of derivatives under the Financial Reform Act, including certain central clearing and 
exchange trading activities, will require Citigroup to 
restructure certain areas of its derivatives business which 
will be disruptive and may adversely affect the results of 
operations from certain of its over-the-counter and other 
derivatives activities. 
The Financial Reform Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder 
will require certain over-the-counter derivatives to be standardized, subject 
to requirements for transaction reporting, clearing through regulatorily 
recognized clearing facilities and trading on exchanges or exchange-
like facilities. The regulations implementing this aspect of the Financial 
Reform Act, including for example the definition of, and requirements 
for, ﬁswap execution facilitiesﬂ through which transactions and reporting 
in standardized products may be required to be carried out, and the 
determination of margin requirements, are still in the process of being 
formulated, and thus, the final scope of the requirements is not known. These 

requirements will, however, necessitate changes to certain areas of Citi™s 
derivatives business structures and practices, including without limitation 
the successful and timely installation of the appropriate technological and 
operational systems to report and trade the applicable derivatives accurately, 
which will be disruptive, divert management attention and require additional 
investment into such businesses. The above changes could also increase Citigroup™s exposure to the 
regulatorily recognized clearing facilities and exchanges, which could build 
up into material concentrations of exposure. This could result in Citigroup 
having a significant dependence on the continuing efficient and effective 
functioning of these clearing and trading facilities, and on their continuing 
financial stability. 
In addition, under the so-called ﬁpush-outﬂ provisions of the Financial Reform Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder, derivatives 

activities, with the exception of bona fide hedging activities and derivatives 
related to traditional bank-permissible reference assets, will be curtailed 
on FDIC-insured depository institutions. Citigroup, like many of its U.S. 
bank competitors, conducts a substantial portion of its derivatives activities 
through an insured depository institution. Moreover, to the extent that 

certain of Citi™s competitors conduct such activities outside of FDIC-insured 

depository institutions, Citi would be disproportionately impacted by any 
restructuring of its business for push-out purposes. While the exact nature 
of the changes required under the Financial Reform Act is uncertain, the 
changes that are ultimately implemented will require restructuring these 
activities which could negatively impact Citi™s results of operations from 

these activities. Regulatory requirements aimed at facilitating the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions 
could result in Citigroup having to change its business 
structures, activities and practices in ways that negatively 
impact its operations. 
The Financial Reform Act requires Citi to plan for a rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of future material financial distress or failure, 
and to provide its regulators information regarding the manner in which 
Citibank, N.A. and its other insured depository institutions are adequately 
protected from the risk of non-bank affiliates. Regulatory requirements 
aimed at facilitating future resolutions in the U.S. and globally could 
result in Citigroup having to restructure or reorganize businesses, legal 
entities, or intercompany systems or transactions in ways that negatively 
impact Citigroup™s operations. For example, Citi could be required to create 
new subsidiaries instead of branches in foreign jurisdictions, or create 
separate subsidiaries to house particular businesses or operations (so-called 
ﬁsubsidiarizationﬂ), which would, among other things, increase Citi™s legal, 
regulatory and managerial costs, negatively impact Citi™s global capital and 
liquidity management and potentially impede its global strategy. While Citigroup believes one of its competitive advantages is its extensive global network, Citi™s extensive operations 
outside of the U.S. subject it to emerging market and 
sovereign volatility and numerous inconsistent or 
conflicting regulations, which increase Citi™s compliance, 
regulatory and other costs. 
Citigroup believes its extensive global networkŠwhich includes a physical 

presence in approximately 100 countries and services offered in over 

160
 countries and jurisdictionsŠprovides it a competitive advantage in 
servicing the broad financial services needs of large multinational clients and 

its customers around the world, including in many of the world™s emerging 

markets. This global footprint, however, subjects Citi to emerging market and 

sovereign volatility and extensive, often inconsistent or conflicting, regulation, 

all of which increase Citi™s compliance, regulatory and other costs.73The emerging markets in which Citi operates or invests are often more volatile than the U.S. markets or other developed markets, and are subject to changing political, social, economic and financial factors, including 
currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to companies 
or investments in those markets or countries. Citi™s extensive global 

operations also expose it to sovereign risk, particularly in the countries in 
which Citi has a physical presence. There have recently been instances of 
disruptions and internal strife in some countries in which Citigroup operates 
which can place Citi™s staff at risk and can result in losses, particularly 

if the sovereign defaults or nationalizes Citi™s assets
. These risks must be 
balanced against Citigroup™s obligations to its customers in the country 

and its obligations to the central bank as a major international participant 
in the functioning of the country™s wholesale market. In addition, Citi™s 

global footprint also subjects it to higher compliance risk relating to 
U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate 
activities, such as anti-money laundering and Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act violations, which can also be more acute in less developed markets and which can require substantial investments in order to comply. Citigroup believes the level of regulation of financial institutions around the world will likely further increase as a result of the recent financial crisis 
and the numerous regulatory efforts underway outside the U.S., which, 
to date, have not necessarily been undertaken on a coordinated basis. For 
example, uncertainties in the global regulatory arena that could impact 
Citigroup include, among others, different and inconsistent insolvency and 
resolution regimes and capital and liquidity requirements that may result in 
mandatory ﬁring-fencingﬂ of capital or liquidity in certain jurisdictions, thus 
increasing Citigroup™s overall global capital and liquidity needs, as well as 

the possibility of bank taxes or fees, some of which could be significant. The extensive regulations to which Citi is subject, or may be subject in the future, are often inconsistent or conflicting, not only with U.S. regulations, 
but among jurisdictions around the world. Moreover, depending on the final 

regulations, Citi could be disproportionately impacted in comparison to other 
global financial institutions. Any failure by Citi to remain in compliance with 
applicable U.S. regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and 
markets in which it operates as a result of its global footprint could result 
in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which 
could negatively impact Citi™s earnings as well as its reputation generally. In 

addition, complying with inconsistent, conflicting or duplicative regulations 
requires extensive time and effort and further increases Citigroup™s 

compliance, regulatory and other costs.Provisions of the Financial Reform Act and other 
regulations relating to securitizations will impose 
additional costs on securitization transactions, increase 
Citigroup™s potential liability in respect of securitizations 
and may prohibit Citigroup from performing certain roles 
in securitizations, each of which could make it impractical 
to execute certain types of transactions and may have an 
overall negative effect on the recovery of the securitization 
markets.
Citigroup plays a variety of roles in asset securitization transactions, 
including acting as underwriter of asset-backed securities, depositor of 
the underlying assets into securitization vehicles and counterparty to 
securitization vehicles under derivative contracts. The Financial Reform 
Act contains a number of provisions intended to increase the regulation 
of securitizations. These include a requirement that securitizers retain 
un-hedged exposure to at least 5% of the economic risk of certain assets 
they securitize, a prohibition on securitization participants engaging in 
transactions that would involve a conflict with investors in the securitization 
and extensive additional requirements for review and disclosure of the 
characteristics of the assets underlying securitizations. In addition, the 
FDIC has adopted new criteria for establishing transfers of assets into 
securitization transactions from entities subject to its resolution authority, 
and the FASB has modified the requirements for transfers of assets to 
be recognized for financial accounting purposes and for securitization 
vehicles to be consolidated with a securitization participant. In April 2010, 
the SEC proposed further additional, extensive regulation of securitization 
transactions. The cumulative effect of these extensive regulatory changes, as well as other potential future regulatory changes (e.g., GSE reform), on the nature 
and profitability of securitization transactions, and Citi™s participation 

therein, cannot currently be assessed. It is likely, however, that these various 

measures will increase the costs of executing securitization transactions, 
could effectively limit Citi™s overall volume of, and the role Citi may play 

in, securitizations, expose Citigroup to additional potential liability for 
securitization transactions and make it impractical for Citigroup to execute 
certain types of securitization transactions it previously executed. In addition, 
certain sectors of the overall securitization markets, such as residential 
mortgage-backed securitizations, have been inactive or experienced 
dramatically diminished transaction volumes for the last several years due 
to the financial crisis. The recovery of the overall securitization markets, 
and thus the opportunities for Citigroup to participate in securitization 
transactions, could also be adversely affected by these various regulatory 
reform measures.74The credit rating agencies continuously review the ratings of Citigroup and its subsidiaries, and have particularly 
focused on the impact of the Financial Reform Act on 
the ratings support assumptions of U.S. bank holding 
companies, including Citigroup. Reductions in Citigroup™s 
and its subsidiaries™ credit ratings could have a significant 
and immediate impact on Citi™s funding and liquidity 
through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and 
collateral triggers. 
Each of Citigroup™s and Citibank, N.A.™s long-term/senior debt and short-
term/commercial paper ratings are currently rated investment grade by Fitch, 

Moody™s and Standard & Poor™s (S&P). The rating agencies continuously 
evaluate Citigroup and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citigroup™s and 
its subsidiaries™ long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of 
factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within 
the control of Citigroup and its subsidiaries, such as conditions affecting the 
financial services industry generally.Moreover, 
each of Fitch, Moody™s and S&P 
has indicated that they are evaluating the impact of the Financial Reform Act on the rating support 
assumptions currently included in their methodologies as related to large 
U.S. bank holding companies, including Citigroup. These evaluations 
are generally a result of the rating agencies™ belief that the Financial 
Reform Act, including the establishment and development of the new 
orderly liquidation regime, increases the uncertainty regarding the U.S. 
government™s willingness and ability to provide extraordinary support to such 

companies. Consistent with this belief and to bring Citigroup in line with 
other large U.S. banks, during 2010, S&P and Moody™s revised their outlooks 

on Citigroup™s supported ratings from stable to negative, and Fitch placed 

Citigroup™s supported ratings on negative rating watch. The ultimate timing 

of the completion of the credit rating agencies™ evaluations, as well as the 
outcomes, is uncertain. In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, Citigroup and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain 

their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody™s or 

S&P could have a significant and immediate impact on Citi™s funding and 

liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral 
triggers. A reduction in Citigroup™s or its subsidiaries™ credit ratings could also 

widen Citi™s credit spreads or otherwise increase its borrowing costs and limit 

its access to the capital markets. For additional information on the potential 
impact of a reduction in Citigroup™s or its subsidiaries™ credit ratings, 

see ﬁCapital Resources and LiquidityŠFunding and LiquidityŠCredit Ratingsﬂ above.The restrictions imposed on proprietary trading and funds-
related activities by the Financial Reform Act and the 
regulations thereunder will limit Citigroup™s trading for 
its own account and could also, depending on the scope of 
the final regulations, adversely impact Citigroup™s market-
making activities and force Citi to dispose of certain of its 
investments at less than fair market value. 
The so-called ﬁVolcker Ruleﬂ provisions of the Financial Reform Act restrict 
the proprietary trading activities of depository institutions, entities that 
own or control depository institutions and their affiliates. The ultimate 
contours of the restrictions on proprietary trading will depend on the 
final regulations. The rulemaking must address, among other things, the 
scope of permissible market-making and hedging activities. The ultimate 
outcome of the rulemaking process as to these and other issues is currently 
uncertain and, accordingly, so is the level of compliance and monitoring 
costs and the degree to which Citigroup™s trading activities, and the results of 
operations from those activities, will be negatively impacted. In addition, any 
restrictions imposed by final regulations in this area will affect Citigroup™s 
trading activities globally, and thus will likely impact it disproportionately 
in comparison to foreign financial institutions which will not be subject to 
the Volcker Rule provisions of the Financial Reform Act with respect to their 
activities outside of the United States. In addition, the Volcker Rule restricts Citigroup™s funds-related activities, 
including Citi™s ability to sponsor or invest in private equity and/or hedge 

funds. Under the Financial Reform Act, bank regulators have the flexibility to 
provide firms with extensions allowing them to hold their otherwise restricted 
investments in private equity and hedge funds for some time beyond 
the statutory divestment period. If the regulators elect not to grant such 
extensions, Citi could be forced to divest certain of its investments in illiquid 
funds in the secondary market on an untimely basis. Based on the illiquid 
nature of the investments and the prospect that other industry participants 
subject to similar requirements would likely be divesting similar assets at 
the same time, such sales could be at substantial discounts to their otherwise 
current fair market value.The establishment of the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, as well as other provisions of the 
Financial Reform Act and ensuing regulations, could affect 
Citi™s practices and operations with respect to a number of 
its U.S. Consumer businesses and increase its costs.
The Financial Reform Act established the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection (CFPB), an independent agency within the Federal Reserve 
Board. The CFPB was given rulemaking authority over most providers of 
consumer financial services in the U.S. as well as enforcement authority 
over the consumer operations of banks with assets over $10 billion, such as 
Citibank, N.A. The CFPB was also given interpretive authority with respect 
to numerous existing consumer financial services regulations (such as 
Regulation Z, Truth in Lending) that were previously interpreted by the 
Federal Reserve Board. Because this is an entirely new agency, the impact 
on Citigroup, including its retail banking, mortgages and cards businesses, 75is largely uncertain. However, any new regulatory requirements, or modified interpretations of existing regulations, will affect Citi™s U.S. Consumer 
practices and operations, potentially resulting in increased compliance costs. 
Moreover, the Financial Reform Act also provides authority to the SEC to 
determine fiduciary duty standards applicable to brokers of retail customers. 
Any new such standards could also affect Citigroup™s business practices with 
retail investment customers and could have indirect additional effects on 
standards applicable to business with certain institutional customers. In addition, the Financial Reform Act fundamentally altered the current balance between state and federal regulation of consumer financial law. 

The provisions of the Financial Reform Act relating to the doctrine of 
ﬁfederal preemptionﬂ may allow a broader application of state consumer 
financial laws to federally chartered institutions such as Citibank, N.A. 
and Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. In addition, the Financial Reform Act 
eliminated federal preemption protection for operating subsidiaries such as 
CitiMortgage, Inc. The Financial Reform Act also allows state authorities 
to bring certain types of enforcement actions against national banks 
under applicable law and granted states the ability to bring enforcement 
actions and to secure remedies against national banks for violation of 
CFPB regulations as well. This additional exposure to state lawsuits and 
enforcement actions, which could be extensive, could subject Citi to increased 
litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, further increasing costs. Recent legislative and regulatory changes have imposed substantial changes and restrictions on Citi™s U.S. credit 
card businesses, leading to adverse financial impact 
and uncertainty regarding the nature of the credit card 
business model going forward.
In May 2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) which, among other things, 
restricts certain credit card practices, requires expanded disclosures to 
consumers and provides consumers with the right to opt out of certain 
interest rate increases. Complying with these changes, as well as the 
requirements of the amendments to Regulation Z adopted by the Federal 
Reserve Board to implement them, required Citigroup to invest significant 
management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure, 
system and practices changes in its U.S. card businesses, and has negatively 
impacted Citi™s credit card revenues. While Citi has fully implemented all of the provisions of the CARD Act that have taken effect, the so-called ﬁlook-backﬂ rules, requiring a re-evaluation 
of rate increases since January 2009, remain to be implemented during 2011, 
and could further adversely impact Citi™s credit card revenues. 
In addition to any potential ongoing financial impact, the CARD Act has raised uncertainties regarding the nature of the credit card business model 
going forward. These uncertainties include, among others, potential changes 
to revenue streams, reduction in the availability of credit to higher risk 
populations, and reduction in the amount of credit to eligible populations, 
all of which may impact the traditional credit card business model, 
including Citi™s. 
There has been increased attention relating to mortgage 
representation and warranty claims, foreclosure process 
issues and the legitimacy of mortgage securitizations 
and transfers, which has increased, and may continue to 
increase, Citi™s potential liability with respect to mortgage 
repurchases or indemnification claims and its foreclosures 
in process.
Citigroup is exposed to representation and warranty claims relating to its U.S. 
Consumer mortgage businesses and, to a lesser extent, through private-label 
residential mortgage securitizations sponsored by Citi™s S&B business. With regard to the U.S. Consumer mortgage businesses, as of December 31, 2010, 
Citi services approximately $456 billion of loans previously sold. During 2010, Citi increased its repurchase reserve from approximately $482 million 
to $969 million at December 31, 2010. See ﬁManaging Global RiskŠCredit 
RiskŠConsumer Mortgage Representations and Warranties
ﬂ below. 

Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions 

and estimates in calculating repurchase reserves. If these assumptions or 
estimates prove to be incorrect, the liabilities incurred in connection with 
successful repurchase or indemnification claims may be substantially higher 
or lower than the amounts reserved.With regard to S&B private-label mortgage securitizations, S&B has to date received only a small number of claims for breaches of representations 
and warranties. Particularly in light of the increased attention to these and 
related matters, the number of such claims and Citi™s potential liability could 

increase. Citigroup is also exposed to potential underwriting liability relating 
to S&B mortgage securitizations as well as underwritings of other residential 
mortgage-backed securities sponsored and issued by third parties. See Note 29 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, allegations of irregularities in foreclosure processes across the industry, including so-called ﬁrobo-signingﬂ by mortgage loan servicers, 

and questions relating to the legitimacy of the securitization of mortgage 
loans and the Mortgage Electronic Registration System™s role in tracking 

mortgages, holding title and participating in the mortgage foreclosure 
process, have gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, Department of 
Justice, regulatory agencies, state attorneys general and the media, among 
other parties. Numerous governmental entities, including a number of 
federal agencies and all 50 state attorneys general, have commenced 
proceedings or otherwise sought information from various financial 
institutions, including Citigroup, relating to these issues. Governmental or 
regulatory investigations of alleged irregularities in the industry™s foreclosure 

processes, or any governmental or regulatory scrutiny of Citigroup™s 

foreclosure processes, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the 
diversion of management™s attention and increased expense, and could result 

in fines, penalties, other equitable remedies, such as principal reduction 
programs, and significant legal, negative reputational and other costs.76While Citigroup has determined that the integrity of its current foreclosure process is sound and there are no systemic issues, in the event deficiencies materialize, or if there is any adverse industry-wide regulatory or judicial 
action taken with respect to mortgage foreclosures, the costs associated with 
Citigroup™s mortgage operations could increase significantly and Citigroup™s 

ability to continue to implement its current foreclosure processes could be 
adversely affected.Any increase or backlog in the number of foreclosures in process, whether related to Citi foreclosure process issues or industry-wide efforts to prevent or 
forestall foreclosure, has broader implications for Citigroup™s U.S. Consumer 

mortgage portfolios. Specifically, to the extent that Citigroup is unable to take 

possession of the underlying assets and sell the properties on a timely basis, 
growth in the number of foreclosures in process could:inflate the amount of 180+ day delinquencies in Citigroup™s mortgage statistics;increase Consumer non-accrual loans (90+ day delinquencies); create a dampening effect on Citi™s net interest margin as non-accrual assets build on the balance sheet; 
negatively impact the amounts ultimately realized for property subject to foreclosure; and 
cause additional costs to be incurred in connection with legislative or regulatory investigations.Further, any increase in the time to complete foreclosure sales may result in an increase in servicing advances and may negatively impact the value 
of Citigroup™s MSRs and mortgage-backed securities, in each case due to 
an adverse change in the expected timing and/or amount of cash flows to 
be received.The continued uncertainty relating to the sustainability and pace of economic recovery has adversely affected, and 
may continue to adversely affect, Citigroup™s businesses 
and results of operations.
The financial services industry and the capital markets have been, and may 
continue to be, adversely affected by the economic recession and continued 
disruptions in the global financial markets. This continued uncertainty 
and disruption has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, 
the corporate and sovereign bond markets, equity markets, debt and equity 
underwriting and other elements of the financial markets. Volatile financial 
markets and reduced (or only slightly increased) levels of client business 
activity may continue to negatively impact Citigroup™s business, capital, 
liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading 
price of Citigroup™s common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.In addition, there has recently been increased focus on the potential for sovereign debt defaults and/or significant bank failures in the Eurozone. 
Despite assistance packages to Greece and Ireland, and the creation in 
May 2010 of a joint EU-IMF European Financial Stability Facility, yields 

on government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, including Portugal 
and Spain, have continued to rise. There can be no assurance that the 
market disruptions in the Eurozone, including the increased cost of funding for certain Eurozone governments, will not spread, nor can there be any 
assurance that future assistance packages will be available or sufficiently 
robust to address any further market contagion in the Eurozone or elsewhere.Moreover, market and economic disruptions have affected, and may 
continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal 
bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt 
(including strategic defaults on home mortgages) and home prices, among 
other factors, particularly in Citi™s 
North America Consumer businesses. 
Combined with persistently high levels of U.S. unemployment, as well 
as any potential future regulatory actions, these factors could result in 
reduced borrower interaction and participation in Citi™s loss mitigation 

and modification programs, particularly Citi™s U.S. mortgage modification 

programs, or increase the risk of re-default by borrowers who have completed 
a modification, either of which could increase Citi™s net credit losses and 

delinquency statistics. To date, asset sales and modifications under Citi™s 

modification programs, including the U.S. Treasury™s Home Affordable 

Modification Program (HAMP), have been the primary drivers of improved 
performance within Citigroup™s U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolios (see 

ﬁManaging Global RiskŠCredit RiskŠU.S. Consumer Mortgage Lendingﬂ 
and ﬁConsumer Loan Modification Programsﬂ below). To the extent 

uncertainty regarding the economic recovery continues to negatively impact 
consumer confidence and the consumer credit factors discussed above, Citi™s 

businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.The maintenance of adequate liquidity depends on numerous factors outside of Citi™s control, including but 
not limited to market disruptions and regulatory and 
legislative liquidity requirements, and Citi™s need to 
maintain adequate liquidity has negatively impacted, 
and may continue to negatively impact, its net interest 
margin (NIM).
Adequate liquidity is essential to Citigroup™s businesses. As seen in recent 
years, Citigroup™s liquidity can be, and has been, significantly and negatively 
impacted by factors Citigroup cannot control, such as general disruption of 
the financial markets, negative views about the financial services industry 
in general, or Citigroup™s short-term or long-term financial prospects or 
perception that it is experiencing greater liquidity or financial risk. Moreover, 
Citigroup™s ability to access the capital markets and its cost of obtaining 
long-term unsecured funding is directly related to its credit spreads in 
both the cash bond and derivatives markets, also outside of its control. 
Credit spreads are influenced by market and rating agency perceptions of 
Citigroup™s creditworthiness and may also be influenced by movements in the 
costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to Citigroup™s long-term 
debt. Increases in Citigroup™s credit qualifying spreads can, and did during 
the financial crisis, significantly increase the cost of this funding.Further, the prospective regulatory liquidity standards for financial 
institutions are currently subject to rulemaking and change, both in the U.S. 
and internationally, resulting in uncertainty as to their ultimate scope and 

effect. In particular, the Basel Committee has developed two quantitative 

measures intended to strengthen liquidity risk management and supervision: 77a short-term Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and a long-term, structural Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR, which will become a minimum 
requirement on January 1, 2015, is designed to ensure banking organizations 
maintain an adequate level of unencumbered cash and high quality 
unencumbered assets that can be converted into cash to meet liquidity needs. 
The NSFR, which will become a minimum requirement by January 1, 2018, 
is designed to promote the medium- and long-term funding of assets and 
activities over a one-year time horizon. The LCR must be at least 100%, while 
the NSFR must be greater than 100%. Citi may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity in light of the liquidity standards proposed by the Basel Committee or other regulators 
in the U.S. or abroad, or Citi™s costs to maintain such liquidity levels may 

increase. For example, Citi could be required to increase its long-term 
funding to meet the NSFR, the cost of which could also be negatively effected by the regulatory requirements aimed at facilitating the orderly resolution 
of financial institutions. Moreover, Citigroup™s ability to maintain and 

manage adequate liquidity is dependent upon the continued economic 
recovery as well as the scope and effect of any other legislative or regulatory 
developments or requirements relating to or impacting liquidity. 
During 2010, consistent with its strategy, Citigroup continued to divest 
relatively higher yielding assets from Citi Holdings. The desire to maintain 
adequate liquidity continued to cause Citigroup to invest its available funds 
in lower-yielding assets, such as those issued by the U.S. government. As a 

result, during 2010, the yields across both the interest-earning assets and the 
interest-bearing liabilities continued to remain under pressure. The lower 
asset yields more than offset the lower cost of funds, resulting in continued 
low NIM. There can be no assurance that Citigroup™s NIM will not continue 

to be negatively impacted by these factors.Citigroup™s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it 
experiences an ﬁownership changeﬂ under the Internal 
Revenue Code.
As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup had recognized net DTAs of 
approximately $52.1 billion, which are included in its tangible common 
equity. Citigroup™s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income 
may be significantly limited if Citigroup experiences an ﬁownership changeﬂ 
as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(Code). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative 
change in Citigroup™s ownership by ﬁ5-percent shareholdersﬂ (as defined in 
the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change DTAs equal 

to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, 
multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments)
, 
provided that the annual limitation would be increased each year to the 
extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year.
  The limitation 
arising from an ownership change under Section 382 on Citigroup™s ability 

to utilize its DTAs will depend on the value of Citigroup™s stock at the time of 

the ownership change.  Under IRS Notice 2010-2, Citi did not experience an 
ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 as a result of the sales 
of its common stock held by the U.S. Treasury.
The value of Citi™s DTAs could be reduced if corporate 
tax rates in the U.S., or certain foreign jurisdictions, 
are decreased.
There have been recent discussions in Congress and by the Obama 
Administration regarding potentially decreasing the U.S. corporate tax 
rate. In addition, the Japanese government has proposed reductions in 
the national and local corporate tax rates by 4.5% and 0.9%, respectively, 
which could be enacted as early as the first or second quarter of 2011. While 
Citigroup may benefit in some respects from any decreases in these corporate 
tax rates, any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate would result in a 
decrease to the value of Citi™s DTAs, which could be significant. Moreover, if 
the legislation in Japan is enacted as proposed, it would require Citi to take 
an approximate $200 million charge in the quarter in which the legislation 
is so enacted. The expiration of a provision of the U.S. tax law that allows 
Citigroup to defer U.S. taxes on certain active financing 
income could significantly increase Citi™s tax expense.
Citigroup™s tax provision has historically been reduced because active 
financing income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. is 
taxed at the lower local tax rate rather than at the higher U.S. tax rate. 
Such reduction has been dependent upon a provision of the U.S. tax law 
that defers the imposition of U.S. taxes on certain active financing income 
until that income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. This ﬁactive 
financing exceptionﬂ is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2011, and 
while it has been scheduled to expire on numerous prior occasions and has 
been extended each time, there can be no assurance that the exception will 
continue to be extended. In the event this exception is not extended beyond 
2011, the U.S. tax imposed on Citi™s active financing income earned outside 
the U.S. would increase after 2011, which could further result in Citi™s tax 
expense increasing significantly.Citigroup may not be able to continue to wind down Citi Holdings at the same pace as it has in the past two years.
While Citigroup intends to dispose of or wind down the Citi Holdings 
businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically rational manner, 
and while Citi made substantial progress towards this goal during 2009 
and 2010, Citi may not be able to dispose of or wind down the businesses or 
assets that are part of Citi Holdings at the same level or pace as in the past 
two years. BAM primarily consists of the MSSB JV, pursuant to which Morgan 
Stanley has call rights on Citi™s ownership interest in the venture over a 
three-year period beginning in 2012. Of the remaining assets in SAP, as of December 31, 2010, approximately one-third are held-to-maturity. In LCL, approximately half of the remaining assets consist of U.S. mortgages as of 
December 31, 2010, which will run off over time, and larger businesses such 
as CitiFinancial. As a result, Citi™s ability to simplify its organization may 
not occur as rapidly as it has in the past. In addition, the ability of Citigroup 
to continue to reduce its risk-weighted assets or limit its expenses through, 
among other things, the winding down of Citi Holdings may be adversely 
affected depending on the ultimate pace or level of Citi Holdings business 
divestitures, portfolio run-offs and asset sales.78Citigroup remains subject to restrictions on its ability to pay common stock dividends and to redeem or repurchase 
Citigroup equity or trust preferred securities for so long 
as its trust preferred securities continue to be held by the 
U.S government.
Pursuant to its agreements with certain U.S. government entities, dated June 9, 

2009, executed in connection with Citi™s exchange offers consummated in 

July and September 2009, Citigroup remains subject to dividend and share 

repurchase restrictions for so long as the U.S. government continues to hold 

any Citigroup trust preferred securities acquired in connection with the 

exchange offers. These restrictions, subject to certain exceptions, generally 

prohibit Citigroup from paying regular cash dividends in excess of $0.01 per 

share of common stock per quarter or from redeeming or repurchasing any 

Citigroup equity securities or trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2010, 

approximately $3.025 billion of trust preferred securities issued to the FDIC 

remains outstanding (of which approximately $800 million is being held for 

the benefit of the U.S.
 Treasury). In addition, even if Citigroup were no longer 
contractually bound by the dividend and share purchase restrictions of these 

agreements, any decision by Citigroup to pay common stock dividends or 

initiate a share repurchase will be subject to further regulatory approval. 
Citi could be harmed competitively if it is unable to hire or retain qualified employees as a result of regulatory 
uncertainty regarding compensation practices or otherwise. 

Citigroup™s performance and competitive standing is heavily dependent on 
the talents and efforts of the highly skilled individuals that it is able to attract 
and retain, including without limitation in its S&B business. Competition for such individuals within the financial services industry has been, and will 
likely continue to be, intense. Compensation is a key element of attracting and retaining highly qualified employees. Banking regulators in the U.S., European Union and 
elsewhere are in the process of developing principles, regulations and other 
guidance governing what are deemed to be sound compensation practices 
and policies, and the outcome of these processes is uncertain. In addition, 
compensation for certain employees of financial institutions, such as 
bankers, continues to be a legislative focus both in Europe and in the U.S.Changes required to be made to the compensation policies and practices of Citigroup, or those of the banking industry generally, may 

hinder Citi™s ability to compete in or manage its businesses effectively, to 

expand into or maintain its presence in certain businesses and regions, 
or to remain competitive in offering new financial products and services. 
This is particularly the case in emerging markets, where Citigroup is often 
competing for qualified employees with other financial institutions that seek 
to expand in these markets. Moreover, new disclosure requirements may 

result from the worldwide regulatory processes described above. If this were 
to occur, Citi could be required to make additional disclosures relating to the 

compensation of its employees in a manner that creates competitive harm 
through the disclosure of previously confidential information, or through 
the direct or indirect new disclosures of the identity of certain employees 
and their compensation. Any such additional public disclosure of employee compensation, or any future legislation or regulation that requires Citigroup 
to restrict or modify its compensation policies, could hurt Citi™s ability to hire, 

retain and motivate its key employees and thus harm it competitively. 
Citigroup is subject to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings that are often highly complex, slow 
to develop and are thus difficult to predict or estimate.
At any given time, Citigroup is defending a significant number of legal 
and regulatory proceedings, and the volume of claims and the amount of 
damages and penalties claimed in litigation, arbitration and regulatory 
proceedings against financial institutions generally remain high. 
Proceedings brought against Citi may result in judgments, settlements, fines, 
penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, or other results adverse 
to it, which could materially and negatively affect Citigroup™s businesses, 
financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in 
Citi™s operations, or cause Citigroup reputational harm. Moreover, the many 
large claims asserted against Citi are highly complex and slow to develop, 
and they may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such 
proceedings may thus be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the 
proceedings, which may last several years. Although Citigroup establishes 
accruals for its litigation and regulatory matters according to accounting 
requirements, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those 
matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued. In addition, while Citi seeks to prevent and detect employee misconduct, such as fraud, employee misconduct is not always possible to deter or 
prevent, and the extensive precautions Citigroup takes to prevent and detect 
this activity may not be effective in all cases, which could subject Citi to 
additional liability. Moreover, the so-called ﬁwhistle
-blowerﬂ provisions of 
the Financial Reform Act, which apply to all corporations and other entities 
and persons, provide substantial financial incentives for persons to report 
alleged violations of law to the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission. These provisions could increase the number of claims that 
Citigroup will have to investigate or against which Citigroup will have to 
defend itself, and may otherwise further increase Citigroup™s legal liabilities.
For additional information relating to Citigroup™s potential exposure 
relating to legal and regulatory matters, see Note 29 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several key 
financial accounting and reporting standards utilized by 
Citi which, if adopted as proposed, could have a material 
impact on how Citigroup records and reports its financial 
condition and results of operations. 
The FASB is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several of the 
financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of 
Citigroup™s financial statements. While the outcome of these reviews and 
proposed changes is uncertain and difficult to predict, certain of these 
changes could have a material impact on how Citigroup records and 
reports its financial condition and results of operations, and could hinder 79understanding or cause confusion across comparative financial statement periods. For example, the FASB™s financial instruments and balance sheet 
offsetting projects could, among other things, significantly change how 
Citigroup classifies, measures and reports financial instruments, determines 
the impairment on those assets, accounts for hedges, and determines when 
assets and liabilities may be offset. In addition, the FASB™s leasing project 
could eliminate most operating leases and instead capitalize them, which 
would result in a gross-up of Citi™s balance sheet and a change in the timing 
of income and expense recognition patterns for leases. Moreover, the FASB continues its convergence project with the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) pursuant to which U.S. 
GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are to be 
converged. The FASB and IASB continue to have significant disagreements on 

the convergence of certain key standards affecting Citi™s financial reporting, 

including accounting for financial instruments and hedging. In addition, 
the SEC has not yet determined whether, or when, U.S. companies will be 

required to adopt IFRS. There can be no assurance that the transition to 
IFRS, if and when required to be adopted by Citi, will not have a material 
impact on how Citi reports its financial results, or that Citi will be able to 
meet any transition timeline so adopted. Citigroup™s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause 
unexpected losses in the future, sometimes significant.
Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions and 
estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining 
credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures, 
mortgage representation and warranty claims and the fair value of certain 
assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates 
underlying Citigroup™s financial statements are incorrect, Citigroup may 
experience significant losses. For additional information on the key areas 
for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi™s financial 
statements, see ﬁSignificant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimatesﬂ 
below, and for further information relating to litigation and regulatory 
exposures, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Citigroup may incur significant losses as a result of 
ineffective risk management processes and strategies, and 

concentration of risk increases the potential for such losses.
Citigroup seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure across businesses, 
regions and critical products through a risk and control framework 
encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, 
operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, 
management review processes and other mechanisms. While Citigroup 
employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation 
techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their 
application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and 
financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of 
such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved 
unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using 
historical data to manage risk.Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses. Because of concentration of risk, Citigroup may suffer losses even when economic and 
market conditions are generally favorable for Citigroup™s competitors. These 

concentrations can limit, and have limited, the effectiveness of Citigroup™s 

hedging strategies and have caused Citigroup to incur significant losses, 
and they may do so again in the future. In addition, Citigroup extends large 
commitments as part of its credit origination activities. Citigroup™s inability 

to reduce its credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, 
including during periods of market dislocation, could negatively affect its 
results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, as 
well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. Although Citigroup™s activities expose it to the credit risk of many different 
entities and counterparties, Citigroup routinely executes a high volume of 
transactions with counterparties in the financial services sector, including 

banks, other financial institutions, insurance companies, investment banks 
and government and central banks. This has resulted in significant credit 
concentration with respect to this sector. To the extent regulatory or market 

developments lead to an increased centralization of trading activity through 
particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, this could increase 
Citigroup™s concentration of risk in this sector.
A failure in Citigroup™s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair its 
liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of 
confidential information, damage Citigroup™s reputation 
and cause losses.
Citigroup™s businesses are highly dependent on their ability to process and 
monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of 
which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many 
currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services 
Citigroup provides to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, 
as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of Citigroup™s 
client base and its geographical reach, developing and maintaining 
Citigroup™s operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, 
particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements 
and technological shifts. Citigroup™s financial, account, data processing or 
other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become 
disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, 
such as a spike in transaction volume, cyberattack or other unforeseen 
catastrophic events, which may adversely affect Citigroup™s ability to process 
these transactions or provide services.In addition, Citigroup™s operations rely on the secure processing, storage 
and transmission of confidential and other information on its computer 
systems and networks. Although Citigroup takes protective measures to 
maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Citi™s and its clients™ 

information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavors to 
modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of 
the threats continues to evolve. As a result, Citigroup™s computer systems, 

software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or 
destruction of data (including confidential client information), account 80takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyberattacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. 
Despite the defensive measures Citigroup has taken, these threats may come 
from external actors such as governments, organized crime and hackers, 
third parties such as outsource or infrastructure-support providers and 
application developers, or may originate internally from within Citigroup. 
Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be 
repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.Citigroup also faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination 
or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate Citigroup™s 

business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or 

other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an 

attack on or breach of Citigroup™s operational systems, data or infrastructure. In 

addition, as Citigroup™s interconnectivity with its clients grows, it increasingly 

faces the risk of operational failure with respect to its clients™ systems.If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored 
in, and transmitted through, Citigroup™s computer systems and networks, 

or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in Citi™s, as well as its 

clients™ or other third parties™, operations, which could result in reputational 
damage, financial losses, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction 
or loss.Failure to maintain the value of the Citigroup brand could 
harm Citi™s global competitive advantage and its strategy. 
Citi™s ability to continue to leverage its extensive global footprint, and thus 
maintain one of its key competitive advantages, depends on the continued 
strength and recognition of the Citigroup brand on a global basis, including 
the emerging markets as other financial institutions grow their operations 
in these markets and competition intensifies. The Citi name is integral to 
its businesses as well as to the implementation of its strategy to be a global 
bank for its clients and customers. Maintaining, promoting and positioning 
the Citigroup brand will depend largely on the success of its ability to provide 
consistent, high-quality financial services and products to these clients and 
customers around the world. Citigroup™s brand could be harmed if its public 
image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or 
not true, about Citigroup or the financial services industry in general, or 
by a negative perception of Citigroup™s short-term or long-term financial 
prospects. Failure to maintain its brand could hurt Citi™s competitive 
advantage and its strategy. 81MANAGING GLOBAL RISKRISK MANAGEMENTŠOVERVIEWCitigroup believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citigroup has a comprehensive risk 
management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks 
it assumes in conducting its activities. These include credit, market and 
operational risks, which are each discussed in more detail throughout 
this section. Citigroup™s risk management framework is designed to balance corporate 
oversight with well-defined independent risk management functions. 
Enhancements continued to be made to the risk management framework 
throughout 2010 based on guiding principles established by Citi™s Chief 

Risk Officer: a common risk capital model to evaluate risks; a defined risk appetite, aligned with business strategy; accountability through a common framework to manage risks; risk decisions based on transparent, accurate and rigorous analytics; expertise, stature, authority and independence of risk managers; and empowering risk managers to make decisions and escalate issues. Significant focus has been placed on fostering a risk culture based on a policy of ﬁTaking Intelligent Risk with Shared Responsibility, Without 

Forsaking Individual Accountabilityﬂ:ﬁTaking intelligent riskﬂ means that Citi must carefully measure and aggregate risks, must appreciate potential downside risks, and must 
understand risk/return relationships.ﬁShared responsibilityﬂ means that risk and business management must actively partner to own risk controls and influence business outcomes.
ﬁIndividual accountabilityﬂ means that all individuals are ultimately responsible for identifying, understanding and managing risks.The Chief Risk Officer, working closely with the Citi CEO and established 
management committees, and with oversight from the Risk Management and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors as well as the full Board of 
Directors, is responsible for: establishing core standards for the management, measurement and reporting of risk; identifying, assessing, communicating and monitoring risks on a company-wide basis; 
engaging with senior management on a frequent basis on material matters with respect to risk-taking activities in the businesses and related risk management processes; and ensuring that the risk function has adequate independence, authority, expertise, staffing, technology and resources. The risk management organization is structured so as to facilitate the management of risk across three dimensions: businesses, regions and critical products. Each of Citi™s major business groups has a Business Chief Risk 

Officer who is the focal point for risk decisions, such as setting risk limits or 
approving transactions in the business. There are Business Chief Risk Officers 
for Global Commercial, Global Consumer, Institutional Client
s Group and the Private Bank. The majority of the staff in Citi™s independent risk 

management organization report to these Business Chief Risk Officers. There 
are also Chief Risk Officers for Citibank, N.A. and Citi Holdings. Regional Chief Risk Officers, appointed in each of Asia, EMEA and Latin America, are accountable for all the risks in their geographic areas 
and are the primary risk contacts for the regional business heads and local 
regulators. In addition, the positions of Product Chief Risk Officers are 
created for those risk areas of critical importance to Citigroup, currently real 
estate and structural market risk as well as fundamental credit. The Product 
Chief Risk Officers are accountable for the risks within their specialty and 
focus on problem areas across businesses and regions. The Product Chief 
Risk Officers serve as a resource to the Chief Risk Officer, as well as to the 

Business and Regional Chief Risk Officers, to better enable the Business and 
Regional Chief Risk Officers to focus on the day-to-day management of risks 
and responsiveness to business flow. 
In addition to revising the risk management organization to facilitate the management of risk across these three dimensions, independent risk also 
includes the business management team to ensure that the risk organization 
has the appropriate infrastructure, processes and management reporting. 
This team includes: the risk capital group, which continues to enhance the risk capital model and ensure that it is consistent across all business activities; the risk architecture group, which ensures the company has integrated systems and common metrics, and thereby allows Citi to aggregate and stress-test exposures across the institution; the infrastructure risk group, which focuses on improving Citi™s operational processes across businesses and regions; and 
the office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which focuses on re-engineering and risk communications, including maintaining critical regulatory relationships. Each of the Business, Regional and Product Chief Risk Officers, as well as the heads of the groups in the business management team report to Citi™s 
Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
82Risk Aggregation and Stress Testing While Citi™s major risk areas are described individually on the following pages, these risks also need to be reviewed and managed in conjunction with 
one another and across the various businesses. The Chief Risk Officer, as noted above, monitors and controls major 
risk exposures and concentrations across the organization. This means 
aggregating risks, within and across businesses, as well as subjecting those 
risks to alternative stress scenarios in order to assess the potential economic 
impact they may have on Citigroup. Comprehensive stress tests are in place across Citi for mark-to-market, available-for-sale and accrual portfolios. These firm-wide stress reports 

measure the potential impact to Citi and its component businesses of very 
large changes in various types of key risk factors (e.g., interest rates, credit 
spreads, etc.), as well as the potential impact of a number of historical and 
hypothetical forward-looking systemic stress scenarios. Supplementing the stress testing described above, Citi risk management, working with input from the businesses and finance, provides periodic 
updates to senior management on significant potential areas of concern 
across Citigroup that can arise from risk concentrations, financial market 
participants, and other systemic issues. These areas of focus are intended to 
be forward-looking assessments of the potential economic impacts to Citi that 

may arise from these exposures. Risk management also reports to the Risk 
Management and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, as well as the 
full Board of Directors, on these matters.The stress testing and focus position exercises are a supplement to the standard limit-setting and risk-capital exercises described below, as 

these processes incorporate events in the marketplace and within Citi that 
impact the firm™s outlook on the form, magnitude, correlation and timing 

of identified risks that may arise. In addition to enhancing awareness 
and understanding of potential exposures, the results of these processes 
then serve as the starting point for developing risk management and 
mitigation strategies. Risk Capital Risk capital is defined as the amount of capital required to absorb potential 
unexpected economic losses resulting from extremely severe events over a 
one-year time period.ﬁEconomic lossesﬂ include losses that are reflected on Citi™s Consolidated Income Statement and fair value adjustments to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, as well as any further declines in value not captured 
on the Consolidated Income Statement. ﬁUnexpected lossesﬂ are the difference between potential extremely severe losses and Citigroup™s expected (average) loss over a one-year time period. 
ﬁExtremely severeﬂ is defined as potential loss at a 99.9% and a 99.97% confidence level, based on the distribution of observed events and scenario analysis. The drivers of economic losses are risks which, for Citi, as referenced above, are broadly categorized as credit risk, market risk and operational risk. 
Credit risk losses primarily result from a borrower™s or counterparty™s inability to meet its financial or contractual obligations. Market risk losses arise from fluctuations in the market value of trading and non-trading positions, including the changes in value resulting from fluctuations in rates. Operational risk losses result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems or human factors or from external events. These risks, discussed in more detail below, are measured and aggregated 
within businesses and across Citigroup to facilitate the understanding of Citi™s exposure to extreme downside events as described under ﬁRisk 

Aggregation and Stress Testingﬂ above. The risk capital framework is 

reviewed and enhanced on a regular basis in light of market developments 
and evolving practices.83CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations. 
Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup™s business activities, including: lending; sales and trading; derivatives; securities transactions; settlement; and when Citigroup acts as an intermediary.Loan and Credit OverviewDuring 2010, Citigroup™s aggregate loan portfolio increased by $57.3 billion 
to $648.8 billion primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 166/167 on 
January 1, 2010. Excluding the impact of SFAS 166/167, the aggregate loan 
portfolio decreased by $102.1 billon. Citi™s total allowance for loan losses 
totaled $40.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a coverage ratio of 6.31% of total 
loans, up from 6.09% at December 31, 2009. During 2010, Citi had a net release of $5.8 billion from its credit reserves and allowance for unfunded lending commitments, compared to a net build 
of $8.3 billion in 2009. The release consisted of a net release of $2.5 billion 
for Corporate loans (primarily in SAP) and a net release of $3.3 billion for 
Consumer loans (mainly a $1.5 billion release in RCB and a $1.8 billion release in LCL). Despite the reserve release for Consumer loans, the 
coincident months of net credit loss coverage for the Consumer portfolio 
increased from 13.7 months in 2009 to 15.0 months in 2010.Net credit losses of $30.9 billion during 2010 decreased $11.4 billion from year-ago levels (on a managed basis). The decrease consisted of a net 

decrease of $7.9 billion for Consumer loans (mainly a $1.1 billion decrease 
in RCB and a $6.7 billion decrease in LCL) and a decrease of $3.5 billion for 
corporate loans (almost all of which is related to SAP).Consumer non-accrual loans (which generally exclude credit cards with the exception of certain international portfolios) totaled $10.8 billion at 
December 31, 2010, compared to $18.3 billion at December 31, 2009. For 
total Consumer loans, the 90 days or more past due delinquency rate was 
2.99% at December 31, 2010, compared to 4.29% at December 31, 2009 (on a 
managed basis). The 30 to 89 days past due Consumer loan delinquency rate 
was 2.92% at December 31, 2010, compared to 3.50% at December 31, 2009 
(on a managed basis).  During 2010, early- and later-stage delinquencies 

improved on a dollar basis across most of the Consumer loan portfolios, 
driven by improvement in North America mortgages, both in first and 
second mortgages, Citi-branded cards in Citicorp and retail partner cards in 
Citi Holdings. The improvement in first mortgages was driven by asset sales 
and loans moving to permanent modifications.Corporate non-accrual loans were $8.6 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $13.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease in non-
accrual loans from the prior year was mainly due to loan sales, write-offs and 
paydowns, which were partially offset by increases due to the weakening of 
certain borrowers.For Citi™s loan accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on 
Citigroup™s Consumer and Corporate loan, credit and allowance data.

88Impaired Loans, Non-Accrual Loans and Assets and Renegotiated LoansThe following pages include information on Citi™s impaired loans, non-
accrual loans and assets and renegotiated loans. There is a certain amount of 
overlap between these categories. The following general summary provides a 
basic description of each category:Impaired loans:Corporate loans are determined to be impaired when they are placed on non-accrual status; that is, when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful.Consumer impaired loans include: (i) Consumer loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) where a long-term concession has been granted to a borrower in financial difficulty; and (ii) non-accrual 
Consumer (commercial market) loans.Non-accrual loans and assets:Corporate and Consumer (commercial market) non-accrual status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal is 
doubtful. These loans are also included in impaired loans.Consumer non-accrual status is based on aging, i.e., the borrower has fallen behind in payments.
North America branded and retail partner cards are not included in non-accrual loans and assets as, under industry standards, they accrue interest until charge-off.Renegotiated loans:Includes both Corporate and Consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR.Includes both accrual and non-accrual TDRs.Impaired LoansImpaired loans are those where Citigroup believes it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the 
loan. Impaired loans include Corporate and Consumer (commercial market) 
non-accrual loans as well as smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose 
terms have been modified due to the borrower™s financial difficulties and 
Citigroup having granted a concession to the borrower. Such modifications 
may include interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness.Valuation allowances for impaired loans are determined in accordance 
with ASC 310-10-35 and estimated considering all available evidence 
including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows 
discounted at the loan™s original effective rate, the secondary market value of 

the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs.Consumer impaired loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous loans 
that have not been modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis, as well 
as substantially all loans modified for periods of 12 months or less. As of 
December 31, 2010, loans included in these short-term programs amounted 
to approximately $5.7 billion. The allowance for loan losses for these loans is 
materially consistent with the requirements of ASC 310-10-35.The following table presents information about impaired loans:In millions of dollarsDec. 31,

Allowance for loan losses
89Non-Accrual Loans and AssetsThe table below summarizes Citigroup™s view of non-accrual loans as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans are loans in which the borrower 
has fallen behind in interest payments or, for Corporate and Consumer 
(commercial market) loans, where Citi has determined that the payment of 
interest or principal is doubtful, and which are thus considered impaired. In 
situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal 
and interest owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are 
reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. There is no industry-wide definition of non-accrual assets, however, and as such, analysis 
across the industry is not always comparable.Corporate and Consumer (commercial markets) non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments but are considered non-accrual if 
Citi has determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful. As 
referenced above, consistent with industry standards, Citi generally accrues 
interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged-off, which typically 
occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, credit card loans are not 

included in the table below.

In certain circumstances, Citigroup modifies certain of its corporate loans involving a non-troubled borrower. These modifications are subject to Citi™s 

normal underwriting standards for new loans and are made in the normal 
course of business to match customers™ needs with available Citi products 
or programs (these modifications are not included in the table above). In 
other cases, loan modifications involve a troubled borrower to whom Citi may grant a concession (modification). Modifications involving troubled 
borrowers may include extension of maturity date, reduction in the stated 
interest rate, rescheduling of future cash flows, reduction in the face amount 
of the debt, or reduction of past accrued interest. In cases where Citi grants 
a concession to a troubled borrower, Citi accounts for the modification as a 

TDR under ASC 310-40.Foregone Interest Revenue on Loans (1)In millions of dollarsIn U.S. officesIn non-

U.S. Consumer Mortgage LendingOverview
Citi™s North America Consumer mortgage portfolio consists of both first 
and second mortgages. As set forth in the table below, as of December 31, 
2010, the first mortgage portfolio totaled approximately $102 billion while 
the second mortgage portfolio was approximately $49 billion. Although the 
majority of the mortgage portfolio is reported in LCL within Citi Holdings, there are $20 billion of first mortgages and $4 billion of second mortgages 
reported in Citicorp.U.S. Consumer Mortgage and Real Estate LoansIn millions of dollars at year end 2010

$27,909$105,48193Citi™s first mortgage portfolio includes $9.3
 billion of loans with FHA or VA 
guarantees. These portfolios consist of loans originated to low-to-moderate-income borrowers with lower FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) scores and 
generally have higher loan-to-value ratios (LTVs). Losses on FHA loans are 

borne by the sponsoring agency, provided that the insurance has not been 

breached as a result of an origination defect. The VA establishes a loan-level 

loss cap, beyond which Citi is liable for loss. FHA and VA loans have high 

delinquency rates but, given the guarantees, Citi has experienced negligible 
credit losses on these loans. The first mortgage portfolio also includes 
$1.8 billion of loans with LTVs above 80%, which have insurance through 

private mortgage insurance (PMI) companies, and $1.7 billion of loans 
subject to long-term standby commitments (LTSC), with U.S. government 

sponsored entities (GSEs), for which Citi has limited exposure to credit losses. 
Citi™s second mortgage portfolio also includes $0.6
 billion of loans subject to 
LTSCs with GSEs, for which Citi has limited exposure to credit losses. Citi™s 

allowance for loan loss calculations take into consideration the impact of 
these guarantees.Consumer Mortgage Quarterly TrendsŠDelinquencies and Net Credit Losses
The following charts detail the quarterly trends in delinquencies and 
net credit losses for Citi™s first and second Consumer mortgage portfolios 
in North America. As set forth in the charts below, net credit losses and 
delinquencies of 90 days or more in both first and second mortgages 
continued to improve during the fourth quarter of 2010. Citi continued to manage down its first and second mortgage portfolios in Citi Holdings during 2010. The first mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings was reduced by almost 20% to $80 billion, and the second mortgage portfolio by 14% to $44 billion, 
each as of December 31, 2010. These reductions were achieved through a 
combination of sales (first mortgages only), run-off and net credit losses.For first mortgages, delinquencies of 90 days or more were down for the fourth consecutive quarter. The sequential decline in delinquencies was due 

entirely to asset sales and trial modifications converting into permanent 
modifications, without which the delinquencies in first mortgages would 
have been up slightly. During the full year 2010, Citi sold $4.8
 billion in 
delinquent mortgages. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, Citi had 
converted a total of approximately $4.8 billion of trial modifications under 
Citi™s loan modification programs to permanent modifications, more than 

three-quarters of which were pursuant to the U.S. Treasury™s Home Affordable 

Modification Program (HAMP).For second mortgages, the net credit loss and delinquencies of 90 days or more were relatively stable compared to the third quarter of 2010.For information on Citi™s loan modification programs regarding 
mortgages, see ﬁConsumer Loan Modification Programsﬂ below.

Second MortgagesŠLoan Balances. In the second mortgage portfolio, the majority of loans are in the higher FICO categories. Economic conditions 
and the decrease in housing prices generally caused a migration towards 
lower FICO scores and higher LTV ratios, although the negative migration 
slowed during the latter half of 2010. Approximately 48% of second 
mortgages had refreshed LTVs above 100%, compared to approximately 0% 
at origination. Approximately 17% of second mortgages had FICO scores less 
than 620 on a refreshed basis, compared to 3% at origination.Balances: December 31, 2010ŠSecond MortgagesAT ORIGINATION

Consumer Mortgage FICO and LTV
Data appearing in the tables below have been sourced from Citigroup™s 
risk systems and, as such, may not reconcile with disclosures elsewhere 
generally due to differences in methodology or variations in the manner in 
which information is captured. Citi has noted such variations in instances 
where it believes they could be material to reconcile to the information presented elsewhere.Citi™s credit risk policy is not to offer option adjustable rate mortgages 
(ARMs)/negative amortizing mortgage products to its customers. As a result, 
option ARMs/negative amortizing mortgages represent an insignificant 
portion of total balances, since they were acquired only incidentally as part of 
prior portfolio and business purchases.A portion of loans in the U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio currently require a payment to satisfy only the current accrued interest for the payment 
period, or an interest-only payment. Citi™s mortgage portfolio includes 

approximately $27 billion of first- and second-mortgage home equity lines 
of credit (HELOCs) that are still within their revolving period and have not 
commenced amortization. The interest-only payment feature during the 
revolving period is standard for the HELOC product across the industry. The 

first mortgage portfolio contains approximately $18 billion of ARMs that 
are currently required to make an interest-only payment. These loans will 
be required to make a fully amortizing payment upon expiration of their 
interest-only payment period, and most will do so within a few years of 
origination. Borrowers that are currently required to make an interest-only 
payment cannot select a lower payment that would negatively amortize the 
loan. First mortgage loans with this payment feature are primarily to high-
credit-quality borrowers that have on average significantly higher origination 

and refreshed FICO scores than other loans in the first mortgage portfolio.Loan BalancesFirst MortgagesŠLoan Balances. As a consequence of the economic 
environment and the decrease in housing prices, LTV and FICO scores have 
generally deteriorated since origination, although they generally stabilized 
during the latter half of 2010. On a refreshed basis, approximately 30% of 
first mortgages had a LTV ratio above 100%, compared to approximately 0% 
at origination. Approximately 28% of first mortgages had FICO scores less 
than 620 on a refreshed basis, compared to 15% at origination.96DelinquenciesThe tables below provide delinquency statistics for loans 90 or more days 
past due (90+DPD) as a percentage of outstandings in each of the FICO/LTV 
combinations, in both the first and second mortgage portfolios, at December 
31, 2010. For example, loans with FICO > 660 and LTV < 80% at origination 
have a 90+DPD rate of 3.6%.As evidenced by the tables below, loans with FICO scores of less than 
620 continue to exhibit significantly higher delinquencies than in any 
other FICO band. Similarly, loans with LTVs greater than 100% have 

higher delinquencies than LTVs of less than or equal to 100%. While the 

dollar balances of 90+DPD loans have declined for both first and second 
mortgages, the delinquency rates have declined for first mortgages, and 
increased for second mortgages, from those reflected in refreshed statistics at 
September 30, 2010.Delinquencies: 90+DPD RatesŠFirst MortgagesAT ORIGINATION

Origination Channel, Geographic Distribution and Origination VintageThe following tables detail Citi™s first and second mortgage portfolios by 
origination channels, geographic distribution and origination vintage.By Origination ChannelCiti™s U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio has been originated from three main 

channels: retail, broker and correspondent.Retail: loans originated through a direct relationship with the borrower.Broker: loans originated through a mortgage broker, where Citi underwrites the loan directly with the borrower.Correspondent: loans originated and funded by a third party, where Citi purchases the closed loans after the correspondent has funded the loan. This channel includes loans acquired in large bulk purchases from other 
mortgage originators primarily in 2006 and 2007. Such bulk purchases 
were discontinued in 2007.First Mortgages: December 31, 2010As of December 31, 2010, approximately 51% of the first mortgage portfolio 
was originated through third-party channels. Given that loans originated 
through correspondents have historically exhibited higher 90+DPD 
delinquency rates than retail originated mortgages, Citi terminated business 
with a number of correspondent sellers in 2007 and 2008. During 2008, Citi 
also severed relationships with a number of brokers, maintaining only those 
who have produced strong, high-quality and profitable volume. 90+DPD 
delinquency amounts and amount of loans with FICO scores of less than 620 
have generally improved, with loan amounts with LTV over 100% remaining 
stable during the latter half of 2010.CHANNEL ($ in billions)First Lien MortgagesChannel % Total

97Second Mortgages: December 31, 2010For second mortgages, approximately 46% of the loans were originated through third-party channels. As these mortgages have demonstrated 
a higher incidence of delinquencies, Citi no longer originates second 
mortgages through third-party channels. 90+DPD delinquency amounts, 
amount of loans with FICO scores of less than 620, and amount of loans with 
LTV over 100% were relatively stable during the latter half of 2010.CHANNEL ($ in billions)Second Lien MortgagesChannel % Total

By State
Approximately half of Citi™s U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio is located 
in five states: California, New York, Florida, Illinois and Texas. These states 
represent 50% of first mortgages and 55% of second mortgages.With respect to first mortgages, Florida and Illinois had above average 90+DPD delinquency rates as of December 31, 2010. Florida has 56% of 
its first mortgage portfolio with refreshed LTV
 > 100%, compared to 30% 
overall for first mortgages. Illinois has 42% of its loan portfolio with refreshed 
LTV
 > 100%. Texas, despite having 40% of its portfolio with FICO
 < 620, had a lower delinquency rate relative to the overall portfolio. Texas had 5% of its 

loan portfolio with refreshed LTV
 > 100%.In the second mortgage portfolio, Florida continued to experience above-average delinquencies at 4.4% as of December 31, 2010, with approximately 
73% of its loans with refreshed LTV > 100%, compared to 48% overall for 

second mortgages.By VintageFor Citigroup™s combined U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolio (first and 
second mortgages), as of December 31, 2010, approximately half of the 
portfolio consisted of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which demonstrate above 
average delinquencies. In first mortgages, approximately 41% of the portfolio 
is of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which had 90+DPD rates well above the overall 
portfolio rate, at 8.0% for 2006 and 8.8% for 2007. In second mortgages, 
61% of the portfolio is of 2006 and 2007 vintages, which again had higher 
delinquencies compared to the overall portfolio rate, at 3.4% for 2006 and 
3.3% for 2007.FICO and LTV Trend InformationŠU.S. Consumer

98As of December 31, 2010, the first mortgage portfolio was approximately 
$89 billion, a reduction of $18 billion, or 17%, from December 2009. First 

mortgage loans with refreshed FICO score below 660 and refreshed LTV 

above 100% were $12.6
 billion as of December 31, 2010, $2.3
 billion, or 15%, 
lower than the balance as of December 2009. Similarly, the second mortgage 

portfolio was approximately $42
 billion as of December 31, 2010, a reduction 
of $7 billion, or 14%, from December 2009. Second mortgage loans with 

refreshed FICO score below 660 and refreshed LTV above 100% were $6.1 billion 

as of December 31, 2010, $0.6 billion, or 8%, lower than the balance as of 

December 2009. Across both portfolios, 90+ DPD rates have generally improved 

since December 31, 2009 across each of the FICO/LTV segments outlined above, 

particularly those segments with refreshed FICO scores below 660.99Interest Rate Risk Associated with Consumer Mortgage Lending ActivityCitigroup originates and funds mortgage loans. As with all other lending 
activity, this exposes Citigroup to several risks, including credit, liquidity and 
interest rate risks. To minimize credit and liquidity risk, Citigroup sells most 
of the mortgage loans it originates, but retains the servicing rights. These 
sale transactions create an intangible asset referred to as MSRs, which expose 
Citi to interest rate risk. For example, the fair value of MSRs declines with 
increased prepayments, and lower interest rates are generally one factor that 
tends to lead to increased prepayments.In managing this risk, Citigroup hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs. However, since the change in the value of these hedges does 

not perfectly match the change in the value of the MSRs, Citigroup is still 
exposed to what is commonly referred to as ﬁbasis risk.ﬂ Citigroup manages 
this risk by reviewing the mix of the various hedges on a daily basis.Citigroup™s MSRs totaled $4.554
 billion and $6.530 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. For additional 

information on Citi™s MSRs, see Notes 18 and 22 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements.As part of its mortgage lending activity, Citigroup commonly enters into 
purchase commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific interest 
rates within a given period of time, generally up to 60 days after the rate 
has been set. If the resulting loans will be classified as loans held-for-sale, 

Citigroup accounts for the commitments as derivatives. Accordingly, changes 

in the fair value of these commitments, which are driven by changes in 
mortgage interest rates, are recognized in current earnings after taking into 
consideration the likelihood that the commitment will be funded.Citigroup hedges its exposure to the change in the value of these commitments.
North America CardsOverview
Citi™s North America cards portfolio consists of its Citi-branded and retail 
partner cards portfolios reported in CiticorpŠRegional Consumer 
Banking and Citi HoldingsŠLocal Consumer Lending, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2010, the Citi-branded portfolio totaled $78 billion, while the 
retail partner cards portfolio was $46 billion.Beginning as early as 2008, Citi actively pursued loss mitigation measures, such as stricter underwriting standards for new accounts and 
closing high-risk accounts, in each of its Citi-branded and retail partner 
cards portfolios. As a result of these efforts, higher risk customers have either 
had their available lines of credit reduced or their accounts closed. On a net 
basis, end-of-period open accounts are down 8% in Citi-branded cards and 
11% in retail partner cards, each versus prior-year levels.
See ﬁConsumer Loan Modification Programsﬂ below for a discussion of Citi™s modification programs for card loans.
Cards Quarterly TrendsŠDelinquencies and Net Credit LossesThe following charts detail the quarterly trends in delinquencies and net 
credit losses for Citigroup™s North America Citi-branded and retail partner 
cards portfolios. Trends for both Citi-branded and retail partner cards 
continued to reflect the improving credit quality of these portfolios. In Citi-
branded cards, delinquencies declined for the fourth consecutive quarter to 
$1.6 billion, an improvement of 12% from the prior quarter. Net credit losses 
declined for the third consecutive quarter to $1.7 billion, 11% lower than the 
prior quarter. In retail partner cards, delinquencies declined for the fourth 
consecutive quarter while net credit losses declined for the sixth consecutive 
quarter. For both portfolios, early-stage delinquencies also continued to 
show improvement.100Citi-Branded Cards

December 31, 2010, while 69% of the retail partner cards portfolio had scores 
of 660 or above. These percentages reflect an improvement during 2010.Balances: December 31, 2010RefreshedCiti-BrandedRetail PartnerFICO  66077%69%620 FICO < 6609%13%FICO < 62014%18%





The table below provides delinquency statistics for loans 90+DPD for both 
the Citi-branded and retail partner cards portfolios as of December 31, 2010. 
Given the economic environment, customers have generally migrated down 
from higher FICO score ranges, driven by their delinquencies with Citi and/
or other creditors. As these customers roll through the delinquency buckets, 
they materially damage their credit score and may ultimately go to charge-
off. Loans 90+DPD are more likely to be associated with low refreshed FICO 
scores, both because low scores are indicative of repayment risk and because 
their delinquency has been reported by Citigroup to the credit bureaus. Loans 
with FICO scores less than 620, which constituted 14% of the Citi-branded 
portfolio as of December 31, 2010 (down from 15% at September 30, 2010), 
have a 90+DPD rate of 13.9% (down from 15.0% at September 30, 2010). 
In the retail partner cards portfolio, loans with FICO scores less than 620 
constituted 18% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2010 (down from 21% at 
September 30, 2010) and have a 90+DPD rate of 17.8% (up from 17.3% at

As of December 31, 2010, the Citi-branded cards portfolio totaled approximately $76 billion (excluding the items noted above), a reduction 
of $7 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2009, primarily driven by lower 
balances in the FICO below 660 segment. In the Citi-branded cards 
portfolio, loans with refreshed FICO scores below 660 were $17.7 billion 
as of December 31, 2010, $4.2 billion or 19% lower than the balance as 
of December 31, 2009. Similarly, the retail partner cards portfolio was 

approximately $43 billion (excluding the items noted above) as of December 
31, 2010, a reduction of $11 billion, or 20%, from December 31, 2009. In the 
retail partner cards portfolio, loans with refreshed FICO scores below 660 were 

$13.2 billion as of December 31, 2010, $6.8 billion, or 34%, lower than the balance as of December 31, 2009.102U.S. Installment and Other Revolving Loans The U.S. Installment portfolio consists of Consumer loans in the following businesses: Consumer Finance, Retail Banking, Auto, Student Lending 
and Cards. Other Revolving consists of Consumer loans (Ready Credit 
and Checking Plus products) in the Consumer Retail Banking business. 
Commercial-related loans are not included.  As of December 31, 2010, the U.S. Installment portfolio totaled 
approximately $26
 billion, while the U.S. Other Revolving portfolio was 
approximately $0.9
 billion. In the table below, the U.S. Installment portfolio 
excludes loans associated with the sale of The Student Loan Corporation that 

occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
While substantially all of the U.S. Installment portfolio is reported in LCL within Citi Holdings, it does include $0.4 billion of Consumer Retail Banking 
loans, which is reported in Citicorp. The U.S. Other Revolving portfolio is 
managed under Citicorp. Approximately 44% of the Installment portfolio had 
FICO credit scores less than 620 on a refreshed basis. Approximately 26% of 
the Other Revolving portfolio is composed of loans having FICO scores less 
than 620. Balances: December 31, 2010RefreshedInstallmentOther RevolvingFICO  66041%59%620 FICO < 66015%15%FICO < 62044%26%




The table below provides delinquency statistics for loans 90+DPD for both the Installment and Other Revolving portfolios. Loans 90+DPD are more 
likely to be associated with low refreshed FICO scores both because low scores 
are indicative of repayment risk and because their delinquency has been 
reported by Citigroup to the credit bureaus. On a refreshed basis, loans with 
FICO scores less than 620 exhibit significantly higher delinquencies than in 
any other FICO band and will drive the majority the losses. For information on Citi™s loan modification programs regarding

105Consumer Loan Modification Programs Citigroup has instituted a variety of long-term and short-term modification programs to assist borrowers with financial difficulties. These programs, as 
described below, include modifying the original loan terms, reducing interest 
rates, extending the remaining loan duration and/or waiving a portion of 
the remaining principal balance. At December 31, 2010, Citi™s significant 
modification programs consisted of the U.S. Treasury™s Home Affordable 
Modification Program (HAMP), as well as short-term and long-term 
modification programs in the U.S., each as summarized below. The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current status varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to qualify for these 

modifications is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging 
from one to three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer 

loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans 
subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be re-aged 
to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly 
payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under 
FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is 
subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 
Furthermore, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies™ 

guidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-age a 
modified loan to current. HAMP and Other Long-Term Programs.
 Long-term 
modification programs or TDRs occur when the terms of a loan have 

been modified due to the borrower™s financial difficulties and a long-term 

concession has been granted to the borrower. Substantially all long-term 

programs in place provide interest rate reductions. See Note 1 to the 

Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the allowance for 

loan losses for such modified loans.The following table presents Citigroup™s Consumer loan TDRs as of 
December 31, 2010 and 2009. As discussed below under ﬁHAMP,ﬂ HAMP loans 

whose terms are contractually modified after successful completion of the trial 

period are included in the balances below:In millions of dollarsDec. 31, 
2010
Dec. 31, 
2010

$15,140$2,2905,869383,015271
These TDRs are predominately concentrated in the U.S. Citi™s significant long-
term U.S. modification programs include: 
U.S. Mortgages HAMP.
 The HAMP is designed to reduce monthly first mortgage payments to a 31% housing debt ratio (monthly mortgage payment, including property 
taxes, insurance and homeowner dues, divided by monthly gross income) 
by lowering the interest rate, extending the term of the loan and deferring or 
forgiving principal of certain eligible borrowers who have defaulted on their 
mortgages or who are at risk of imminent default due to economic hardship. 
The interest rate reduction for first mortgages under HAMP is in effect for five 
years and the rate then increases up to 1% per year until the interest rate cap 
(the lower of the original rate or the Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage 

Market Survey rate for a 30-year fixed rate conforming loan as of the date of 
the modification) is reached. In order to be entitled to a HAMP loan modification, borrowers must complete 
a three-month trial period, make the agreed payments and provide the required 

documentation. Beginning March 1, 2010, documentation was required to be 

provided prior to the beginning of the trial period, whereas prior to that date, 

documentation was required before the end of the trial period. This change 

generally means that Citi is able to verify income for potential HAMP participants 

before they begin making lower monthly payments. Because customers entering 

the trial period are qualified prior to trial entry, more are successfully completing 

the trial period.During the trial period, Citi requires that the original terms of the loans 
remain in effect pending completion of the modification. From inception 

through December 31, 2010, approximately $9.5 billion of first mortgages were 

enrolled in the HAMP trial period, while $3.8
 billion have successfully completed 
the trial period. Upon completion of the trial period, the terms of the loan are 

contractually modified, and it is accounted for as a TDR. 
Citi also began participating in the U.S. Treasury™s HAMP second mortgage 
program (2MP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. 2MP requires Citi to either: 

(1) modify the borrower™s second mortgage according to a defined protocol; or 

(2) accept a lump sum payment from the U.S. Treasury in exchange for full 

extinguishment of the second mortgage. For a borrower to qualify, the borrower 

must have successfully modified his/her first mortgage under the HAMP and 

met other criteria. Under the 2MP program, if the first mortgage is modified 

under HAMP through principal forgiveness, the same percentage of principal 

forgiveness is required on the second mortgage. 
106Loans included in the HAMP trial period are not classified as modified under 
short-term or long-term programs, and the allowance for loan losses for these 
loans is calculated under ASC 450-20. 
As of December 31, 2010, for the loans that were put in the HAMP trial 
period, 34% of the loans were successfully modified under HAMP, 13% were 

modified under the Citi Supplemental program (see below), 5% were in HAMP 

or Citi Supplemental trial, 2% subsequently received other Citi modifications, 

13% received HAMP re-age (see below), and 33% have not received any 

modification from Citi to date.Citi Supplemental. The Citi Supplemental (CSM) program was designed by Citi to assist borrowers ineligible for HAMP or who become 
ineligible through the HAMP trial period process. If the borrower already has 
less than a 31% housing debt ratio, the modification offered is an interest rate 
reduction (up to 2.5% with a floor rate of 4%), which is in effect for two years, and the rate then increases up to 1% per year until the interest rate is at the 
pre-modified contractual rate. If the borrower™s housing debt ratio is greater 

than 31%, specific treatment steps for HAMP, including an interest rate 

reduction, will be followed to achieve a 31% housing debt ratio. The modified 
interest rate is in effect for two years, and then increases up to 1% per year 
until the interest rate is at the pre-modified contractual rate. If income 
documentation was not supplied previously pursuant to HAMP, it is required 

for CSM. Three trial payments are required prior to modification, which can 
be made during the HAMP and/or CSM trial period. HAMP Re-Age. As disclosed above, loans in the HAMP trial period are aged according to their original contractual terms, rather than the modified 
HAMP terms. This results in the loan being reported as delinquent even if the 
reduced payments, as agreed under the program, are made by the borrower. 

Upon conclusion of the trial period, loans that do not qualify for a long-term 
modification are returned to the delinquency status in which they began their 

trial period. However, that delinquency status would be further deteriorated 

for each trial payment not made. HAMP re-age establishes a non-interest-
bearing deferral based on the difference between the original contractual 
amounts due and the HAMP trial payments made. Citigroup considers 
this re-age and deferral process to constitute a concession to a borrower in 
financial difficulty and therefore records the loans as TDRs upon re-age. 2nd FDIC. The 2nd FDIC modification program guidelines were created by the FDIC for delinquent or current borrowers where default is 
reasonably foreseeable. The program is designed for second mortgages and 
uses various concessions, including interest rate reductions, non-interest-
bearing principal deferral, principal forgiveness, extending maturity dates, 
and forgiving accrued interest and late fees. These potential concessions are 
applied in a series of steps (similar to HAMP) that provides an affordable 
payment to the borrower (generally a combined housing payment ratio of 
42%). The first step generally reduces the borrower™s interest rate to 2% for 

fixed-rate home equity loans and 0.5% for home equity lines of credit. The 
interest rate reduction is in effect for the remaining term of the loan. FHA/VA.
 Loans guaranteed by the FHA or VA are modified through the 
normal modification process required by those respective agencies. Borrowers 
must be delinquent, and concessions include interest rate reductions, 
principal forgiveness, extending maturity dates, and forgiving accrued 
interest and late fees. The interest rate reduction is in effect for the remaining 
loan term. Losses on FHA loans are borne by the sponsoring agency, provided 

that the insurance has not been breached as a result of an origination defect. 
The VA establishes a loan-level loss cap, beyond which Citi is liable for loss. 

Historically, Citi™s losses on FHA and VA loans have been negligible.
Responsible Lending. The Responsible Lending (RL) program was 
designed by Citi to assist current borrowers unlikely to be able to refinance 

due to negative equity in their home and/or other borrower characteristics. 

These loans are not eligible for modification under HAMP or CSM. This 

program, launched in the fourth quarter of 2010, is designed to provide 

payment relief based on a floor interest rate by product type. All adjustable 

rate and interest only loans are converted to fixed rate, amortizing loans 

for the remaining mortgage term. Because the borrower has been offered 

terms that are not available in the general market, the loan is accounted 

for as a TDR. 
CFNA Adjustment of Terms (AOT).
 This program is targeted to Consumer Finance customers with a permanent hardship. Payment 
reduction is provided through the re-amortization of the remaining loan 
balance, typically at a lower interest rate. Modified loan tenors may not 
exceed a period of 480 months. Generally, the rescheduled payment cannot 

be less than 50% of the original payment amount unless the AOT is a result of 

participation in the CitiFinancial Home Affordability Modification Program 
(CHAMP) (terminated August 2010) or as a result of settlement, court order, 

judgment, or bankruptcy. Customers must make a qualifying payment at 

the reduced payment amount in order to qualify for the modification. In 
addition, customers must provide income verification (pay stubs and/or 
tax returns), employment is verified and monthly obligations are validated 
through an updated credit report.Other.
 Prior to the implementation of the HAMP, CSM and 2nd FDIC 
programs, Citigroup™s U.S. mortgage business offered certain borrowers 

various tailored modifications, which included reducing interest rates, 
extending the remaining loan duration and/or waiving a portion of the 
remaining principal balance. Citigroup currently believes that substantially 
all of its future long-term U.S. mortgage modifications, at least in the near 
term, will be included in the programs mentioned above. 107North America CardsNorth America cards consists of Citi™s branded and retail partner cards.Paydown. The Paydown program is designed to liquidate a customer™s 
balance within 60 months. It is available to customers who indicate a long-term hardship (e.g., long-term disability, medical issues or a non-temporary 

income reduction, such as an occupation change). Payment requirements 
are decreased by reducing interest rates charged to either 9.9% or 0%, 
depending upon the customer situation, and designed to amortize at least 
1.67% of the balance each month. Under this program, fees are discontinued 
and charging privileges are permanently rescinded. CCG. The Credit Counseling Group (CCG) program handles proposals received via external consumer credit counselors on the customer™s behalf. In 

order to qualify, customers work with a credit counseling agency to develop 

a plan to handle their overall budget, including money owed to Citi. A copy 
of the counseling agency™s proposal letter is required. The annual percentage 

rate (APR) is reduced to 9.9% and the account fully amortizes in 60 months. 
Under this program, fees are discontinued and charging privileges are 
permanently rescinded.Interest Reversal Paydown. The Interest Reversal Paydown program is also designed to liquidate a customer™s balance within 60 months. 

It is available to customers who indicate a long-term hardship. Accumulated interest and fees owed to Citi are reversed upon enrollment, and future 
interest and fees are discontinued. Payment requirements are reduced and 
are designed to amortize at least 1.67% of the balance each month. Under 
this program, like the programs discussed above, fees are discontinued, and 
charging privileges are permanently rescinded.U.S. Installment LoansCFNA AOT.
 This program is targeted to Citi™s Consumer Finance customers 

with a permanent hardship. Payment reduction is provided through the 
re-amortization of the remaining loan balance, typically at a lower interest 
rate. Loan payments may be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 
120 months. Generally, the rescheduled payment cannot be less than 50% of 

the original payment amount, unless the AOT is a result of settlement, court 
order, judgment or bankruptcy. The interest rate generally cannot be reduced 

below 9% (except in the instances listed above). Customers must make a 
qualifying payment at the reduced payment amount in order to qualify for 
the modification. In addition, customers must provide proof of income, 
employment is verified and monthly obligations are validated through an 
updated credit report. Long-Term Modification ProgramsŠSummaryThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2010, information relating to Citi™s significant long-term U.S. mortgage, card and installment loan

108Short-Term Programs.
 Citigroup has also instituted short-term programs (primarily in the U.S.) to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. These programs include short-term (12 months or less) interest 
rate reductions and deferrals of past due payments. The loan volume 
under these short-term programs has increased significantly over the past 
18 months, and loan loss reserves for these loans have been enhanced, 
giving consideration to the higher risk associated with those borrowers and 
reflecting the estimated future credit losses for those loans. See Note 1 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the allowance for loan 
losses for such modified loans.The following table presents the amounts of gross loans modified under 
short-term interest rate reduction programs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2010:

1,634701,086110Significant short-term U.S. programs include:North America CardsUniversal Payment Program (UPP). The North America cards business provides short-term interest rate reductions to assist borrowers 
experiencing temporary hardships through the UPP. Under this program, a 

participant™s APR is reduced by at least 500 basis points for a period of up to 

12 months. The minimum payment is established based upon the customer™s 

specific circumstances and is designed to amortize at least 1% of the principal 
balance each month. The participant™s APR returns to its original rate at the 

end of the program or earlier if they fail to make the required payments. U.S. Mortgages Temporary AOT.
 This program is targeted to Consumer Finance 
customers with a temporary hardship. Examples of temporary hardships 
include a short-term medical disability or a temporary reduction of pay. 

Under this program, which can include both an interest rate reduction and a 
term extension, the interest rate is reduced for either a five- or an eleven-
month period. At the end of the temporary modification period, the interest 
rate reverts to the pre-modification rate. To qualify, customers must make a 

payment at the reduced payment amount prior to the AOT being processed. 
In addition, customers must provide income verification, while employment 
is verified and monthly obligations are validated through an updated credit 
report. If the customer is still undergoing hardship at the conclusion of the temporary payment reduction, an extension of the temporary terms can be 
considered in either of the time period increments above, to a maximum of 
24 months. Effective December 2010, the timing of the qualifying payment 
is earlier and updated documentation is required at each extension. These 
changes are expected to reduce overall entry volumes. In cases where 
the account is over 60 days past due at the expiration of the temporary 
modification period, the terms of the modification are made permanent and 
the payment is kept at the reduced amount for the remaining life of the loan. U.S Installment LoansTemporary AOT.

to Citi™s significant short-term U.S. cards, mortgage, and installment loan 
modification programs:In millions of dollars










109Payment deferrals that do not continue to accrue interest (extensions) primarily occur in the U.S. residential mortgage business. Under an extension, payments that are contractually due are deferred to a later date, 
thereby extending the maturity date by the number of months of payments 
being deferred. Extensions assist delinquent borrowers who have experienced 
short-term financial difficulties that have been resolved by the time the 
extension is granted. An extension can only be offered to borrowers who are 
past due on their monthly payments but have since demonstrated the ability 
and willingness to pay as agreed. Other payment deferrals continue to accrue 
interest and are not deemed to offer concessions to the customer. Other types 

of concessions are not material.Impact of Modification ProgramsCiti considers various metrics in analyzing the success of U.S. modification 
programs. Payment behavior of customers during the modification (both 
short-term and long-term) is monitored. For short-term modifications, 
performance is also measured for an additional period of time after the 
expiration of the concession. Balance reductions and annualized loss rates 
are also important metrics that are monitored. Based on actual experience, 
program terms, including eligibility criteria, interest charged and loan tenor, 
may be refined. The main objective of the modification programs is to reduce 
the payment burden for the borrower and improve the net present value of 
Citi™s expected cash flows. Mortgage Modification ProgramsWith respect to long-term mortgage modification programs, for 
modifications in the ﬁOtherﬂ category (as noted in the ﬁLong-Term 
Modification ProgramsŠSummaryﬂ table above and preceding narrative), 
generally at 24 months after modification, the total balance reduction has 
been approximately 32% (as a percentage of the balance at the time of 
modification), consisting of approximately 20% of paydowns and 12% of net 
credit losses. In addition, at 18 months after an ﬁOtherﬂ loan modification, 
Citi currently estimates that credit loss rates are reduced by approximately 
one-third compared to loans that were not modified. For modifications under CFNA™s long-term AOT program, the total balance 
reduction has been approximately 13% (as a percentage of the balance 
at the time of modification) 24 months after modification, consisting of 
approximately 4% of paydowns and 9% of net credit losses. Regarding HAMP, in Citi™s experience to date, Citi continues to believe that 
re-default rates for HAMP modified loans will be significantly lower versus 
non-HAMP programs. Moreover, the first HAMP modified loans have been on 

the books for approximately 12 months and, as of December 31, 2010, were exhibiting re-default rates of approximately 15%. The CSM program has 
less vintage history and limited loss data but is currently tracking to Citi™s 

expectations and is currently expected to perform better than the ﬁOtherﬂ 
modifications discussed above. Generally, the other long-term mortgage 

modification programs discussed above do not have sufficient history, as of 

December 31, 2010, to summarize the impact of such programs. Similarly, 

the short-term AOT program has less vintage history and limited loss data. Cards Modification Programs
Generally, at 24 months after modification, the total balance reduction 
for long-term card modification programs is approximately 64% (as 
a percentage of the balance at the time of modification), consisting of 
approximately 35% of paydowns and 29% of net credit losses. Citi has also 
generally observed that these credit losses are approximately one-half 
lower, depending upon the individual program and vintage, than those 
of similar card accounts that were not modified. Similarly, twenty-four 
months after starting a short-term modification, balances are typically 
reduced by approximately 64% (as a percentage of the balance at the time of 
modification), consisting of approximately 24% of paydowns and 40% of net 
credit losses, and Citi has observed that the credit losses are approximately 
one-fourth lower, depending upon the individual program and vintage, than 
those of similar accounts that were not modified.As previously disclosed, Citigroup implemented certain changes to its credit card modification programs beginning in the fourth quarter 
of 2010, including revisions to the eligibility criteria for such programs.  
These programs are continually evaluated and additional changes may 
occur in 2011, depending upon factors such as program performance and 
overall credit conditions. As a result of these changes, as well as the overall 
improving portfolio trends, the overall volume of new entrants to Citi™s card 

modification programs decreased, as expected, by approximately 25% during 
the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to the third quarter. New entrants 

to short-term card modification programs decreased by approximately 
50% in the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to the prior quarter. While 

Citi currently expects these changes to negatively impact net credit losses 
beginning in 2011, Citi believes overall that net credit losses will continue 
to improve in 2011 for each of the North America cards businesses. Citi 
considered these changes to its cards modification programs and their 
potential effect on net credit losses in determining the loan loss reserve as of 
December 31, 2010.Installment Loan Modification ProgramsWith respect to the long-term CFNA AOT program, the total balance 
reduction is approximately 49% (as a percentage of the balance at the time 
of modification) 24 months after modification, consisting of approximately 
13% of paydowns and 36% of net credit losses. The short-term Temporary AOT program has less vintage history and limited loss data.110Consumer Mortgage Representations and WarrantiesThe majority of Citi™s exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to its U.S. Consumer mortgage business.Representation and WarrantiesAs of December 31, 2010, Citi services loans previously sold as follows:In millionsDecember 31, 2010

In addition, since 2000, Citi has sold $94 billion of loans to private investors, of which $49 billion were sold through securitizations. As of 
December 31, 2010, $39 billion of these loans (including $15 billion sold 
through securitizations) continue to be serviced by Citi and are included in 
the $456 billion of serviced loans above.When selling a loan, Citi (through its CitiMortgage business) makes various representations and warranties relating to, among other things, the 
following:Citi™s ownership of the loan;the validity of the lien securing the loan;the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan;the effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing the loan;the process used in selecting the loans for inclusion in a transaction;the loan™s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the buyer; and the loan™s compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws.The specific representations and warranties made by Citi depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer. Market 
conditions and credit-rating agency requirements may also affect 
representations and warranties and the other provisions to which Citi may 
agree in loan sales. Repurchases or ﬁMake-Wholeﬂ Payments
In the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, Citi 
may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans (generally 
at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest) with the identified 
defects, or indemnify (ﬁmake-wholeﬂ) the investors for their losses. Citi™s 
representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in 
amount or time of coverage. However, contractual liability arises only when 
the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a 
loss results from the breach. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 77% and 64%, respectively, of Citi™s repurchases and make-whole payments were attributable 

to misrepresentation of facts by either the borrower or a third party (e.g., 
income, employment, debts, FICO, etc.), appraisal issues (e.g., an error or 
misrepresentation of value), or program requirements (e.g., a loan that does 
not meet investor guidelines, such as contractual interest rate). To date, there 

has not been a meaningful difference in incurred or estimated loss for each 
type of defect.In the case of a repurchase, Citi will bear any subsequent credit loss on 
the mortgage loan and the loan is typically considered a credit-impaired 

loan and accounted for under SOP 03-3, ﬁAccounting for Certain Loans and 

Debt Securities, Acquired in a Transferﬂ (now incorporated into ASC 310-30, 

ReceivablesŠLoans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit 

Quality). These repurchases have not had a material impact on Citi™s non-

performing loan statistics because credit-impaired purchased SOP 03-3 loans 

are not included in non-accrual loans, since they generally continue to accrue 

interest until write-off.The unpaid principal balance of loans repurchased due to representation and warranty claims for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 
respectively, was as follows: 
Year ended December 31,
2010In millions of dollarsUnpaid principal balance

26Total
$306As evidenced in the table above, to date, Citi™s repurchases have primarily 
been from the U.S. government sponsored entities (GSEs). In addition, Citi recorded make-whole payments of $310 million and $49 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
111Repurchase ReserveCiti has recorded a reserve for its exposure to losses from the obligation to 
repurchase previously sold loans (referred to as the repurchase reserve) 
that is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 
estimating the repurchase reserve, Citi considers reimbursements estimated 
to be received from third-party correspondent lenders and indemnification 
agreements relating to previous acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights. Citi 

aggressively pursues collection from any correspondent lender that it believes 
has the financial ability to pay. The estimated reimbursements are based on 
Citi™s analysis of its most recent collection trends and the financial solvency 
of the correspondents. In the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired SOP 03-3 loan, the difference between the loan™s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the 

time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve. 
Make-whole payments to the investor are also treated as utilizations and 
charged directly against the reserve. The repurchase reserve is estimated 
when Citi sells loans (recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is 
included in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income) and is 
updated quarterly. Any change in estimate is recorded in 
Other revenue. The repurchase reserve is calculated by individual sales vintage (i.e., the year the loans were sold) and is based on various assumptions. While 
substantially all of Citi™s current loan sales are with GSEs, with which Citi 

has considerable historical experience, these assumptions contain a level 
of uncertainty and risk that, if different from actual results, could have a 
material impact on the reserve amounts. The most significant assumptions 
used to calculate the reserve levels are as follows:Loan documentation requests: Assumptions regarding future expected loan documentation requests exist as a means to predict future repurchase 

claim trends. These assumptions are based on recent historical trends 
as well as anecdotal evidence and general industry knowledge about the 
current repurchase environment (e.g., the level of staffing and focus 
by the GSEs to ﬁputﬂ more loans back to servicers). These factors are 
considered in the forecast of expected future repurchase claims and 
changes in these trends could have a positive or negative impact on Citi™s 
repurchase reserve. During 2009 and 2010, loan documentation requests 
trended higher than in the prior periods, which led to an increase in the 
repurchase reserve. Repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests: Given that loan documentation requests are an indicator of future repurchase claims, an assumption is made regarding the 
conversion rate from loan documentation requests to repurchase claims. 
This assumption is also based on historical performance and, if actual 
rates differ in the future, could also impact repurchase reserve levels. 
While this percentage was generally stable during 2009, during 2010, Citi 
observed a slight increase in this conversion rate, meaning Citi observed a 
slight increase in the number of loan documentation requests converting 
to repurchase claims. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, Citi 
observed an improvement in the conversion rate, meaning that as loan 
documentation requests increased, the claims as a percentage of such 
requests have been trending lower. Claims appeal success rate: This assumption represents Citi™s expected 
success at rescinding a claim by satisfying the demand for more 
information, disputing the claim validity, etc. This assumption is also based 

on recent historical successful appeals rates. These rates could fluctuate 

and, in Citi™s experience, have historically fluctuated significantly based on 

changes in the validity or composition of claims. Generally, during 2009 

and 2010, Citi™s appeal success rate improved from levels in prior periods, 

which had a favorable impact on the repurchase reserve. 
Estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole: The assumption of 
the estimated loss amount per repurchase or make-whole payment, or 
loss severity, is applied separately for each sales vintage to capture volatile 

housing price highs and lows. The assumption is based on actual and 

expected losses of recent repurchases/make-whole payments calculated 

for each sales vintage year, which are impacted by factors such as 

macroeconomic indicators, including overall housing values. During 2009 

and 2010, including the fourth quarter of 2010, Citi™s loss severity increased. 
In sum, and as set forth in the table below, during 2009, loan 
documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased. 
In addition, Citi™s loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the 

impact of macroeconomic factors and its experience with actual losses at such 

time. These factors contributed to a change in estimate for the repurchase 

reserve amounting to $492
 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 
During 2010, loan documentation package requests, the level of outstanding 

claims and loss severity estimates increased, contributing to a change in 

estimate for the repurchase reserve amounting to $917 million for the year 

ended December 31, 2010. In addition, included in Citi™s current reserve 

estimate is an assumption that repurchase claims will remain at elevated levels 
112for the near term, although the actual number of claims may differ and is 
subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, in Citi™s experience to date, approximately 

half of the repurchase claims have been successfully appealed and have resulted 

in no loss to Citi. The activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended 

December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:Year ended December 31,

(446)Balance, end of period
$969As referenced above, the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage. The majority of the repurchases in 2010 were from the 2006 through 2008 
sales vintages, which also represent the vintages with the largest loss severity. 
An insignificant percentage of 2010 repurchases were from vintages prior to 
2006, and Citi anticipates that this percentage will continue to decrease, as 
those vintages are later in the credit cycle. Although still early in the credit 
cycle, Citi has to date experienced lower repurchases and loss severity from 
the 2009 and 2010 vintages.Sensitivity of Repurchase ReserveAs discussed above, the repurchase reserve estimation process is subject to 
numerous estimates and judgments. The assumptions used to calculate the 
repurchase reserve contain a level of uncertainty and risk that, if different 
from actual results, could have a material impact on the reserve amounts. 
For example, Citi estimates that if there were a simultaneous 10% adverse 
change in each of the significant assumptions noted above, the repurchase 
reserve would increase by approximately $342 million as of December 31, 
2010. This potential change is hypothetical and intended to indicate the 
sensitivity of the repurchase reserve to changes in the key assumptions. Actual 
changes in the key assumptions may not occur at the same time or to the 
same degree (i.e., an adverse change in one assumption may be offset by an 
improvement in another). Citi does not believe it has sufficient information to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss (as defined under ASC 450) 
relating to its Consumer representations and warranties. Representation and Warranty ClaimsŠBy Claimant

113Securities and Banking-Sponsored Private Label Residential 
Mortgage SecuritizationsŠRepresentations and Warranties
Over the years, S&B has been a sponsor of private-label mortgage-backed 
securitizations. Mortgage securitizations sponsored by Citi™s S&B business 
represent a much smaller portion of Citi™s mortgage business than Citi™s 
Consumer business discussed above.During the period 2005 through 2008, S&B sponsored approximately $66 billion in private-label mortgage-backed securitization transactions, 
of which approximately $28 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 
2010. These outstanding transactions are backed by loan collateral composed 
of approximately $7.4 billion prime, $5.9 billion Alt-A and $14.3 billion 
subprime residential mortgage loans. Citi estimates the actual cumulative 
losses to date incurred by the issuing trusts on the $66 billion total 
transactions referenced above have been approximately $6.7 billion.The mortgages included in these securitizations were purchased from parties outside of S&B, and fewer than 3% of the mortgages currently 
outstanding were originated by Citi. In addition, fewer than 10% of the 
currently outstanding mortgage loans underlying these securitization 
transactions are serviced by Citi. The loans serviced by Citi are included in 
the $456 billion of residential mortgage loans referenced under ﬁConsumer 
Mortgage Representations and Warrantiesﬂ above. (Citi acts as master 

servicer for certain of the securitization transactions.)In connection with such transactions, representations and warranties (representations) relating to the mortgage loans included in each trust 
issuing the securities were made either by (1) Citi, or (2) in a relatively small 
number of cases, third-party sellers (Selling Entities, which were also often 
the originators of the loans). These representations were generally made or 
assigned to the issuing trust.The representations in these securitization transactions generally related to, 
among other things, the following:the absence of fraud on the part of the mortgage loan borrower, the seller or any appraiser, broker or other party involved in the origination of the 
mortgage loan (which was sometimes wholly or partially limited to the 
knowledge of the representation provider);whether the mortgage property was occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence;
the mortgage loan™s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;whether the mortgage loan was originated in conformity with the originator™s underwriting guidelines; and
the detailed data concerning the mortgage loans that was included on the mortgage loan schedule.The specific representations relating to the mortgage loans in each securitization may vary, however, depending on various factors such as the 
Selling Entity, rating agency requirements and whether the mortgage loans 

were considered prime, Alt-A or subprime in credit quality.
In the event of a breach of its representations, Citi may be required either to 
repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects (generally at unpaid 

principal balance plus accrued interest) or indemnify the investors for their losses.For securitizations in which Citi made representations, these representations typically were similar to those provided to Citi by the Selling 
Entities, with the exception of certain limited representations required by 
rating agencies. These latter representations overlapped in some cases with 
the representations described above.In cases where Citi made representations and also received those representations from the Selling Entity for that loan, if Citi is the subject of a 
claim based on breach of those representations in respect of that loan, it may 
have a contractual right to pursue a similar (back-to-back) claim against 
the Selling Entity. If only the Selling Entity made representations, then 

only the Selling Entity should be responsible for a claim based on breach of 
these representations in respect of that loan. (This discussion only relates to 
contractual claims based on breaches of representations.)However, in some cases where Citi made representations and received 
similar representations from Selling Entities, including a majority of such 
cases involving subprime and Alt-A collateral, Citi believes that those Selling 
Entities appear to be in bankruptcy, liquidation or financial distress. In those 

cases, in the event that claims for breaches of representations were to be 
made against Citi, the Selling Entities™ financial condition may effectively 
preclude Citi from obtaining back-to-back recoveries against them.To date,
 S&B has received only a small number of claims based on breaches of representations relating to the mortgage loans in these 
securitization transactions. Citi continues to monitor closely this claim 
activity relating to its S&B mortgage securitizations.In addition to sponsoring residential mortgage securitization transactions as described above, S&B engages in other residential mortgage-related 
activities, including underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities. 
S&B participated in the underwriting of these S&B-sponsored securitizations, as well as underwritings of other residential mortgage-backed securities 
sponsored and issued by third parties. For additional information on litigation claims relating to these activities, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.114CORPORATE LOAN DETAILSFor corporate clients and investment banking activities across Citigroup, the credit process is grounded in a series of fundamental policies, in addition 
to those described under ﬁManaging Global RiskŠRisk ManagementŠ
Overview,ﬂ above. These include:joint business and independent risk management responsibility for managing credit risks;a single center of control for each credit relationship that coordinates credit activities with that client;
portfolio limits to ensure diversification and maintain risk/capital alignment;
a minimum of two authorized credit officer signatures required on extensions of credit, one of which must be from a credit officer in credit risk management;risk rating standards, applicable to every obligor and facility; andconsistent standards for credit origination documentation and remedial management.Corporate Credit PortfolioThe following table represents the corporate credit portfolio (excluding Private Banking), before consideration of collateral, by maturity at December 
31, 2010. The corporate portfolio is broken out by direct outstandings that 
include drawn loans, overdrafts, interbank placements, bankers™ acceptances, 
certain investment securities and leases, and unfunded commitments 
that include unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial 
guarantees.At December 31, 2010

100%The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic regions and products.Obligor risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for an obligor and are derived primarily through the use of statistical models 
(which are validated periodically), external rating agencies (under defined 
circumstances) or approved scoring methodologies. Facility risk ratings 
are assigned, using the obligor risk rating, and then factors that affect the loss-given default of the facility, such as support or collateral, are taken 

into account. With regard to climate change risk, factors evaluated include 
consideration of the business impact, impact of regulatory requirements, or 
lack thereof, and impact of physical effects on obligors and their assets.These factors may adversely affect the ability of some obligors to perform and thus increase the risk of lending activities to these obligors. Citigroup 
also has incorporated climate risk assessment criteria for certain obligors, 
as necessary. Internal obligor ratings equivalent to BBB and above are 

considered investment grade. Ratings below the equivalent of the BBB 
category are considered non-investment grade.115The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating at December 31, 2010 and 2009, as a percentage of the total portfolio:Direct outstandings and unfunded commitmentsDecember 31, 2010

Credit Risk MitigationAs part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge portions of the credit risk in its 
portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. The purpose of these transactions 
is to transfer credit risk to third parties. The results of the mark to market and 
any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected in the Principal transactions line on the Consolidated Statement of Income.At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $49.0 billion and $59.6 billion, respectively, of credit risk exposures were economically hedged. Citigroup™s 

expected loss model used in the calculation of its loan loss reserve does not 
include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other risk mitigants. 
In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded 
commitments in this report do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the credit protection was

116EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATEICG and the SAP, through their business activities and as capital markets participants, incur exposures that are directly or indirectly tied to the 
commercial real estate (CRE) market, and LCL and RCB hold loans that 
are collateralized by CRE. These exposures are represented primarily by the 
following three categories:(1) Assets held at fair value include approximately $5.7 billion, of which approximately $4.5 billion are securities, loans and other items linked to 
CRE that are carried at fair value as trading account assets, approximately 
$0.7 billion are securities backed by CRE carried at fair value as available-
for-sale (AFS) investments, and approximately $0.5
 billion are loans held-
for-sale. Changes in fair value for these trading account assets are reported 

in current earnings, while AFS investments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income with credit-related other-than-temporary 

impairments reported in current earnings.The majority of these exposures are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Over the last several years, weakened activity in the trading 

markets for some of these instruments resulted in reduced liquidity, thereby 

decreasing the observable inputs for such valuations, and could continue to 
have an adverse impact on how these instruments are valued in the future. 
See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Assets held at amortized cost include approximately $1.6 billion of securities classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) and approximately 
$29.3 billion of loans and commitments. HTM securities are accounted for 
at amortized cost, subject to other-than-temporary impairment. Loans and 

commitments are recorded at amortized cost, less loan loss reserves. The 
impact from changes in credit is reflected in the calculation of the allowance 
for loan losses and in net credit losses.(3) Equity and other investments include approximately $3.7 billion of equity and other investments, such as limited partner fund investments, that 
are accounted for under the equity method, which recognizes gains or losses 
based on the investor™s share of the net income of the investee.

a discussion of funding and liquidity risk, see ﬁCapital Resources and 
LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ above. Price risk is the earnings risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices, and in their implied 
volatilities. Price risk arises in non-trading portfolios, as well as in trading 
portfolios. Market risks are measured in accordance with established standards to ensure consistency across businesses and the ability to aggregate risk. 
Each business is required to establish, with approval from Citi™s market 

risk management, a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors 
that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of 
Citigroup™s overall risk tolerance. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately 

responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining within their 
defined limits. Non-Trading Portfolios Interest Rate Risk One of Citigroup™s primary business functions is providing financial products 
that meet the needs of its customers. Loans and deposits are tailored to the 
customers™ requirements with regard to tenor, index (if applicable) and rate 
type. Net interest revenue (NIR) is the difference between the yield earned on 
the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer loans) and the rate paid 
on the liabilities (including customer deposits or company borrowings). NIR 
is affected by changes in the level of interest rates. For example: At any given time, there may be an unequal amount of assets and liabilities that are subject to market rates due to maturation or repricing. 
Whenever the amount of liabilities subject to repricing exceeds the 
amount of assets subject to repricing, a company is considered ﬁliability 
sensitive.ﬂ In this case, a company™s NIR will deteriorate in a rising rate 
environment. The assets and liabilities of a company may reprice at different speeds or mature at different times, subjecting both ﬁliability-sensitiveﬂ and ﬁasset-sensitiveﬂ companies to NIR sensitivity from changing interest rates. For 
example, a company may have a large amount of loans that are subject 
to repricing in the current period, but the majority of deposits are not 
scheduled for repricing until the following period. That company would 
suffer from NIR deterioration if interest rates were to fall. NIR in the current period is the result of customer transactions and the related contractual rates originated in prior periods as well as new 
transactions in the current period; those prior-period transactions will be 

impacted by changes in rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities in the 
current period. Due to the long-term nature of portfolios, NIR will vary from quarter to quarter even assuming no change in the shape or level of the yield curve 
as assets and liabilities reprice. These repricings are a function of implied 
forward interest rates, which represent the overall market™s estimate of future 

interest rates and incorporate possible changes in the Federal Funds rate as 
well as the shape of the yield curve. Interest Rate Risk Governance The risks in Citigroup™s non-traded portfolios are estimated using a common 
set of standards that define, measure, limit and report the market risk. Each 
business is required to establish, with approval from independent market 
risk management, a market risk limit framework that clearly defines 
approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroup™s overall 
risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the 
market risks they take and for remaining within their defined limits. These 
limits are monitored by independent market risk, country and business Asset 
and Liability Committees and the Global Finance and Asset and Liability 
Committee. Interest Rate Risk Measurement Citigroup™s principal measure of risk to NIR is interest rate exposure (IRE). 
IRE measures the change in expected NIR in each currency resulting solely 
from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. Factors such as 
changes in volumes, spreads, margins and the impact of prior-period pricing 
decisions are not captured by IRE. IRE assumes that businesses make no 
additional changes in pricing or balances in response to the unanticipated 
rate changes. IRE tests the impact on NIR resulting from unanticipated changes in 
forward interest rates. For example, if the current 90-day LIBOR rate is 

3% and the one-year-forward rate is 5% (i.e.,
 the estimated 90-day LIBOR 

rate in one year), the +100 bps IRE scenario measures the impact on the 

company™s NIR of a 100 bps instantaneous change in the 90-day LIBOR to 

6% in one year. 
The impact of changing prepayment rates on loan portfolios is incorporated into the results. For example, in the declining interest rate 
scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios prepay faster and income is 
reduced. In addition, in a rising interest rate scenario, portions of the deposit 
portfolio are assumed to experience rate increases that may be less than the 
change in market interest rates. 118Mitigation and Hedging of Risk Financial institutions™ financial performance is subject to some degree of risk due 
to changes in interest rates. In order to manage these risks effectively, Citigroup 

may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, enter into transactions 

with other institutions or enter into off-balance-sheet derivative transactions that 

have the opposite risk exposures. Thus, Citigroup regularly assesses the viability of 

strategies to reduce unacceptable risks to earnings and implements such strategies 

when it believes those actions are prudent. As information becomes available, 

Citigroup formulates strategies aimed at protecting earnings from the potential 

negative effects of changes in interest rates. 
Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance 
sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they 

relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential 
impact of the change in the spread between different market indices. Non-Trading PortfoliosThe exposures in the following table represent the approximate annualized 
risk to NIR assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
change, as well as a more gradual 100 bps (25 bps per quarter) parallel 
change in rates compared with the market forward interest rates in selected 
currencies.December 31, 2010

The changes in the U.S. dollar IRE from the prior year reflect revised modeling of mortgages and deposits based on lower rates, pricing changes due to the CARD Act, asset sales, debt issuance and swapping activities, as well 
as repositioning of the liquidity portfolio.Certain trading-oriented businesses within Citi have accrual-accounted positions that are excluded from the table above. The U.S. dollar IRE 
associated with these businesses is $(79) million for a 100 basis point 
instantaneous increase in interest rates. The following table shows the risk to NIR from six different changes in the implied-forward rates. Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur on a gradual basis every three months over the course of one year. 


Impact to net interest revenue (in millions of dollars)119
Trading Portfolios 
Price risk in trading portfolios is monitored using a series of measures, 
including: 
factor sensitivities; 

value-at-risk (V

AR); and 
stress testing. 

Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position 
for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value 
of a Treasury bill for a one-basis-point change in interest rates. Citigroup™s 
independent market risk management ensures that factor sensitivities are 
calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited, for all relevant risks taken 
in a trading portfolio. 
VAR estimates the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio 
under normal market conditions. The V
AR method incorporates the factor 
sensitivities of the trading portfolio with the volatilities and correlations of 
those factors and is expressed as the risk to Citigroup over a one-day holding 
period, at a 99% confidence level. Citigroup™s V
AR is based on the volatilities 
of and correlations among a multitude of market risk factors as well as 
factors that track the specific issuer risk in debt and equity securities. 
Stress testing is performed on trading portfolios on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on 
both individual trading portfolios, and on aggregations of portfolios and 
businesses. Independent market risk management, in conjunction with the 
businesses, develops stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress-
testing exercises, and uses the information to make judgments as to the 
ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. 
Each trading portfolio has its own market risk limit framework 
encompassing these measures and other controls, including permitted 
product lists and a new product approval process for complex products. 
Total revenues of the trading business consist of:
customer revenue, which includes spreads from customer flow and 

positions taken to facilitate customer orders; 
proprietary trading activities in both cash and derivative transactions; and 

net interest revenue.

All trading positions are marked to market, with the result reflected in 
earnings. In 2010, negative trading-related revenue (net losses) was recorded for 
55 of 260 trading days. Of the 55 days on which negative revenue (net losses) was 
recorded, one day was greater than $100
 
million. The following histogram of total 
daily revenue or loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in 
which Citigroup™s VAR trading-related revenues fell within particular ranges.

Histogram of VAR Daily-Trading Related RevenueŠ12 Months Ended December 31, 2010
to confirm that the daily market value losses in excess of a 99% confidence 
level occur, on average, only 1% of the time. The V
AR calculation for the 
hypothetical test portfolios, with different degrees of risk concentration, meets 
this statistical criterion. 
Citigroup periodically performs extensive back-testing of many hypothetical 
test portfolios as one check of the accuracy of its V
AR. Back-testing is the 
process in which the daily VAR of a portfolio is compared to the actual daily 
change in the market value of its transactions. Back-testing is conducted

interest margin (NIM) is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less 
gross interest expense by average interest earning assets.During 2010, NIM was positively impacted by the adoption of SFAS 
166/167 as well as by the absence of interest on the $20 billion of TARP 

trust preferred securities repaid at the end of 2009.  However, the continued 

de-risking of loan portfolios and run-off and sales of higher-yielding assets in 

Citi Holdings, and investing the proceeds in lower-yielding securities with a 

shorter duration, put pressure on NIM during 2010. See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ above.

126OPERATIONAL RISKOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, systems or human factors, or from external events. It includes the 
reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market 
conduct in which Citi is involved. Operational risk is inherent in Citigroup™s 
global business activities and, as with other risk types, is managed through 
an overall framework designed to balance strong corporate oversight with 
well-defined independent risk management. This framework includes:recognized ownership of the risk by the businesses; oversight by Citi™s independent risk management; and independent review by Citi™s Audit and Risk Review (ARR).The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of Citigroup™s businesses, the markets in which the Company 

operates its capital and liquidity, and the competitive, economic and 

regulatory environment. Notwithstanding these controls, Citigroup incurs 
operational losses.FrameworkTo monitor, mitigate and control operational risk, Citigroup maintains 
a system of comprehensive policies and has established a consistent 
framework for assessing and communicating operational risk and the 
overall effectiveness of the internal control environment across Citigroup. 
An Operational Risk Council provides oversight for operational risk across 
Citigroup. The Council™s membership includes senior members of the 
Chief Risk Officer™s organization covering multiple dimensions of risk 
management, with representatives of the Business and Regional Chief Risk 
Officers™ organizations and the business management group. The Council™s 
focus is on identification and mitigation of operational risk and related 
incidents. The Council works with the business segments and the control 
functions with the objective of ensuring a transparent, consistent and 
comprehensive framework for managing operational risk globally. Each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this framework. The process for 
operational risk management includes the following steps:identify and assess key operational risks; establish key risk indicators; produce a comprehensive operational risk report; and prioritize and assure adequate resources to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.The operational risk standards facilitate the effective communication and mitigation of operational risk both within and across businesses. As new products and business activities are developed, processes are designed, 
modified or sourced through alternative means and operational risks are 
considered. Information about the businesses™ operational risk, historical losses, and the control environment is reported by each major business 
segment and functional area, and is summarized and reported to senior 
management as well as the Risk Management and Finance Committee of 
Citi™s Board of Directors and the full Board of Directors.Measurement and Basel IITo support advanced capital modeling and management, the businesses 
are required to capture relevant operational risk capital information. An 
enhanced version of the risk capital model for operational risk has been 
developed and implemented across the major business segments as a step 
toward readiness for Basel II capital calculations. The risk capital calculation 
is designed to qualify as an ﬁAdvanced Measurement Approachﬂ under 
Basel II. It uses a combination of internal and external loss data to support 
statistical modeling of capital requirement estimates, which are then 
adjusted to reflect qualitative data regarding the operational risk and control 
environment.Information Security and Continuity of BusinessInformation security and the protection of confidential and sensitive 
customer data are a priority for Citigroup. Citi has implemented an 
Information Security Program in accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act and regulatory guidance. The Information Security Program is reviewed 
and enhanced periodically to address emerging threats to customers™ 
information. The Corporate Office of Business Continuity, with the support of senior 
management, continues to coordinate global preparedness and mitigate 
business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures.127[THIS PAGE IN

128COUNTRY AND CROSS-BORDER RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS; SOVEREIGN EXPOSURECountry and Cross-Border Risk Country RiskCountry risk is the risk that an event in a country (precipitated by 
developments within or external to a country) will impair the value of Citi™s 
franchise or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country 
to honor their obligations to Citi. Country risk events may include sovereign 
defaults, banking crises, currency crises, currency convertibility and/or 
transferability restrictions, or political events.The country risk management framework at Citigroup includes a number of tools and management processes designed to facilitate the ongoing 
analysis of individual countries and their risks. These include country risk 
rating models, scenario planning and stress testing, internal watch lists, 
country risk capital limits, and the Country Risk Committee process. The Citigroup Country Risk Committee is the senior forum to evaluate Citi™s total business footprint within a specific country franchise with 

emphasis on responses to current potential country risk events. The 
Committee is chaired by the Head of Global Country Risk Management 
and includes as its members senior business and risk managers. The 
Committee regularly reviews all risk exposures within a country, makes 

recommendations as to actions, and follows up to ensure appropriate 
accountability.
Cross-Border Risk
Cross-border risk is the risk that actions taken by a non-U.S. government may 

prevent the conversion of local currency into non-local currency and/or the 
transfer of funds outside the country, among other risks, thereby impacting 
the ability of Citigroup and its customers to transact business across borders. 
Examples of cross-border risk include actions taken by foreign governments 
such as exchange controls and restrictions on the remittance of funds. These 
actions might restrict the transfer of funds or the ability of Citigroup to 
obtain payment from customers on their contractual obligations. Management oversight of cross-border risk is performed through a formal review process that includes annual setting of cross-border limits 
and ongoing monitoring of cross-border exposures, as well as monitoring of 
economic conditions globally and the establishment of internal cross-border 
risk management policies.Under Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) regulatory guidelines, total reported cross-border outstandings include cross-
border claims on third parties, as well as investments in and funding of local 
franchises. Cross-border claims on third parties (trade and short-, medium- 
and long-term claims) include cross-border loans, securities, deposits with 
banks, investments in affiliates, and other monetary assets, as well as net 
revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products. Cross-border outstandings are reported based on the country of the obligor or guarantor. Outstandings backed by cash collateral are assigned to the 

country in which the collateral is held. For securities received as collateral, 
cross-border outstandings are reported in the domicile of the issuer of 
the securities. Cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the 
domicile of the counterparty in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. Investments in and funding of local franchises represent the excess of local country assets over local country liabilities. Local country assets 
are claims on local residents recorded by branches and majority-owned 
subsidiaries of Citigroup domiciled in the country, adjusted for externally 

guaranteed claims and certain collateral. Local country liabilities are 
obligations of non-U.S. branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of 
Citigroup for which no cross-border guarantee has been issued by another 
Citigroup office.129As required by SEC rules, the table below shows all countries where total FFIEC cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:December 31, 2010

Sovereign Exposure Citi™s total sovereign exposure is defined as loans net of hedges, unfunded 
lending commitments, available for sale securities, trading securities, 
and securities purchased under agreements to resell, in which the direct 
obligor is a foreign government. Trading account assets consist of foreign 
government securities and other mark-to-market gains on derivative and 
other trading account positions. Foreign office liabilities are not considered 
in the calculation of sovereign exposure as they are included in cross-border 
exposure.Cross-border exposure nets foreign office liabilities against foreign office claims in the total exposure calculation.  Sovereign exposure includes 
gross exposure, and does not consider foreign office liabilities in the total 
exposure calculation.Unfunded commitments are not considered part of the total outstandings calculation for cross-border risk.
Sovereign exposure includes the impact of hedges, whereas cross-border risk does not.At December 31, 2010, Citi™s total sovereign exposure approximated $265 billion and consisted of approximately 94% investment grade countries 
and approximately 6% non-investment grade countries.Venezuelan OperationsIn 2003, the Venezuelan government enacted currency restrictions that have 
restricted Citigroup™s ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela at the official 
foreign currency rate.  In May 2010, the government enacted new laws that 
have closed the parallel foreign exchange market and established a new 
foreign exchange market.  Citigroup does not have access to U.S. dollars 
in this new market.  Citigroup uses the official rate to re-measure the 
foreign currency transactions in the financial statements of its Venezuelan 
operations, which have U.S. dollar functional currencies, into U.S. dollars. 
At December 31, 2010, Citigroup had net monetary assets in its Venezuelan 
operations denominated in bolivars of approximately $200 million.130DERIVATIVESSee Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion and disclosures related to Citigroup™s derivative activities. The following 
discussions relate to the Derivative Obligor Information, the Fair Valuation 
for Derivatives and Credit Derivatives activities.Fair Valuation Adjustments for DerivativesThe fair value adjustments applied by Citigroup to its derivative carrying 
values consist of the following items: Liquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for more details) to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which 
the entire position could be liquidated. The liquidity reserve is based on 
the bid/offer spread for an instrument, adjusted to take into account the 
size of the position. Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) are applied to over-the-counter derivative instruments, in which the base valuation generally discounts expected cash flows using LIBOR interest rate curves. Because not all 
counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant 
LIBOR curve, a CVA is necessary to incorporate the market view of both 
counterparty credit risk and Citi™s own credit risk in the valuation.Citigroup CVA methodology comprises two steps. First, the exposure 
profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other quantitative 
analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time. 
The calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk 
mitigants, including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right 
of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as 
netting agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are subject to an 
enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated 
for this purpose, since it is those aggregate net cash flows that are subject to 
nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, point-in-time future 
cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk, rather than using the 
current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the CVA.
Second, market-based views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap market are applied to the expected 
future cash flows determined in step one. Own-credit CVA is determined 

using Citi-specific credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the relevant tenor. 

Generally, counterparty CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each 

credit rating and tenor. For certain identified facilities where individual 

analysis is practicable (for example, exposures to monoline counterparties) 
counterparty-specific CDS spreads are used. The CVA adjustment is designed to incorporate a market view of the credit 
risk inherent in the derivative portfolio. However, most derivative instruments 

are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to 
third parties. Derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or, 

if terminated early, are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between 

the counterparties. Therefore, the CVA (both counterparty and own-credit) 

may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course 
of business. In addition, all or a portion of the credit valuation adjustments 
may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of 
changes in the credit risk of Citi or its counterparties, or changes in the credit 
mitigants (collateral and netting agreements) associated with the derivative 
instruments.The table below summarizes the CVA applied to the fair value of derivative 
instruments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.Credit valuation adjustment

Losses on non-derivative instruments, such as bonds and loans, related to counterparty credit risk are not included in the 
table above.Credit DerivativesCitigroup makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives, both 
on behalf of clients as well as for its own account. Through these contracts 
Citigroup either purchases or writes protection on either a single-name or 
portfolio basis. Citi primarily uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit 
risk in its corporate loan portfolio and other cash positions, and to facilitate 
client transactions.Credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined events 
(settlement triggers). These settlement triggers, which are defined by the 
form of the derivative and the referenced credit, are generally limited to 
the market standard of failure to pay indebtedness and bankruptcy (or 
comparable events) of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of 
transactions, debt restructuring.Credit derivative transactions referring to emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional settlement triggers to cover 
the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment 
moratorium. In certain transactions on a portfolio of referenced credits 
or asset-backed securities, the seller of protection may not be required 
to make payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with 
respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a 
specified amount.132The following tables summarize the key characteristics of Citi™s credit derivatives portfolio by counterparty and derivative form as of December

133The fair values shown are prior to the application of any netting agreements, cash collateral, and market or credit valuation adjustments.Citigroup actively participates in trading a variety of credit derivatives products as both an active two-way market-maker for clients and to manage credit risk. The majority of this activity was transacted with other financial 
intermediaries, including both banks and broker-dealers. Citigroup generally 

has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased 
and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly, rather than entering 

into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The open risk 
exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain 
cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts 
are adjusted, either to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level 
of subordination in tranched structures.Citi actively monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. Approximately 89% and 85% of the gross receivables are from 
counterparties with which Citi maintains collateral agreements as of 
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A majority of Citi™s top 15 

counterparties (by receivable balance owed to the company) are banks, 
financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do 
not include ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty ratings 

downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold 
at which Citigroup may call for additional collateral. A number of the 
remaining significant counterparties are monolines (which have CVA as 

shown above).134SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATESNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of Citigroup™s significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently 
issued accounting pronouncements. These policies, as well as estimates 
made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi™s operations 
and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of 
management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses 
the significant accounting policies that require management to make 
highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times 
regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. 
Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the 
related estimates, and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.VALUATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Citigroup holds fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, retained 
interests in securitizations, investments in private equity, and other financial 
instruments. In addition, Citigroup purchases securities under agreements 
to resell and sells securities under agreements to repurchase. Citigroup holds 
its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase 
agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs, to 
manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks, and for proprietary trading 
and private equity investing. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities described in the preceding paragraph are reflected at fair value on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance 

Sheet. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and 
deposits as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are 
collateralized with cash are carried at fair value. Approximately 37.3% and 
37.6% of total assets, and 16.6% and 16.5% of total liabilities are accounted 
for at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 
established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
(see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If quoted market 
prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed 
valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or 
independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency 
rates, option volatilities, etc. Where a model is internally developed and 
used to price a significant product, it is subject to validation and testing by 
independent personnel. Such models are often based on a discounted cash 
flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated 
valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or 
value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be 
classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that 
are readily observable.The credit crisis caused some markets to become illiquid, thus reducing the availability of certain observable data used by Citigroup™s valuation 

techniques. This illiquidity, in at least certain markets, continued through 

2010. When or if liquidity returns to these markets, the valuations will revert 
to using the related observable inputs in verifying internally calculated 
values. For additional information on Citigroup™s fair value analysis, see 

ﬁManaging Global Riskﬂ and ﬁBalance Sheet Review.ﬂ 
Recognition of Changes in Fair ValueChanges in the valuation of the trading assets and liabilities, as well as 
all other assets (excluding available-for-sale securities and derivatives in 
qualifying cash flow hedging relationships) and liabilities carried at fair 
value are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in 
the valuation of available-for-sale securities, other than write-offs and 
credit impairments, and the effective portion of changes in the valuation 
of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships, generally are 
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), 
which is a component of Stockholders™ equity on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. A full description of Citi™s related policies and procedures can be found 
in Notes 1, 25, 26 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Evaluation of Other-than-Temporary ImpairmentCitigroup conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities 
with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other than 
temporary. Prior to January 1, 2009, these reviews were conducted pursuant 
to FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 (now ASC 320-10-35, InvestmentsŠDebt and Equity Securities: Subsequent Measurement). Any unrealized loss 
identified as other than temporary was recorded directly in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. As of January 1, 2009, Citigroup adopted ASC 320-10. 
Accordingly, any credit-related impairment related to debt securities that Citi 
does not plan to sell and is not likely to be required to sell is recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income, with the non-credit-related impairment 
recognized in AOCI. For other impaired debt securities, the entire impairment 
is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An unrealized loss 
exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its 
amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are determined to be temporary 
in nature are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI for available-for-sale securities, 
while such losses related to held-to-maturity securities are not recorded, as 
these investments are carried at their amortized cost (less any other-than-
temporary impairment). For securities transferred to held-to-maturity from 
Trading account assets, amortized cost is defined as the fair value amount 
of the securities at the date of transfer. For securities transferred to held-to-
maturity from available-for-sale, amortized cost is defined as the original 
purchase cost, plus or minus any accretion or amortization of interest, less 
any impairment recognized in earnings. Regardless of the classification of the securities as available-for-sale or 
held-to-maturity, Citi has assessed each position for credit impairment. 
For a further discussion, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.135Key Controls over Fair Value MeasurementCiti™s processes include a number of key controls that are designed to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, particularly where a fair 
value model is internally developed and used to price a significant product. 
Such controls include a model validation policy requiring that valuation 
models be validated by qualified personnel, independent from those who 
created the models and escalation procedures, to ensure that valuations 
using unverifiable inputs are identified and monitored on a regular basis by 
senior management.CVA MethodologyASC 820-10 requires that Citi™s own credit risk be considered in determining 
the market value of any Citi liability carried at fair value. These liabilities 
include derivative instruments as well as debt and other liabilities for which 
the fair value option was elected. The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is 
recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction or increase in the associated 
liability to arrive at the fair value (carrying value) of the liability.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESManagement provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in 
the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of 
an allowance for loan losses. These reserves are established in accordance 
with Citigroup™s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit Committee 
of the Board of Directors. Citi™s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with 
representatives from the Risk Management and Finance staffs for each 
applicable business area. The above-mentioned representatives covering the business areas having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit-risk ratings 
are assigned (primarily ICG, Regional Consumer Banking and Local 
Consumer Lending), or modified Consumer loans, where concessions were 
granted due to the borrowers™ financial difficulties, present recommended 
reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with 
supporting quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data include: Estimated probable losses for non-performing, non-homogeneous exposures within a business line™s classifiably managed portfolio 
and impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms 
have been modified due to the borrowers™ financial difficulties, where 
it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, when 
determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash 
flows discounted at the loan™s original effective rate; (ii) the borrower™s 
overall financial condition, resources and payment record; and (iii) the 
prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the 
realizable value of any collateral. When impairment is measured based 
on the present value of expected future cash flows, the entire change in 
present value is recorded in the Provision for loan losses.Statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing exposures. The calculation is based upon: (i) Citigroup™s internal system of credit-
risk ratings, which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating 
agencies; and (ii) historical default and loss data, including rating-
agency information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2010, and 
internal data dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event 
of default. 
Additional adjustments include: (i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, 
the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans, and 
the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global 
portfolio; and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such as 
current environmental factors and credit trends. In addition, representatives from both the Risk Management and Finance staffs that cover business areas that have delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller homogeneous loans present their recommended reserve 
balances based upon leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies 
and changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends including housing 
prices, unemployment and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for 

each individual product within each different geographic region in which 
these portfolios exist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and 
diversity of individual large credits, and the ability of borrowers with foreign 
currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly debt 
servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this review. 

Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit costs 
in any quarter and could result in a change in the allowance. Changes to 
the reserve flow through the Consolidated Statement of Income on the line 
Provision for loan losses.Allowance for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsA similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a 
reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and 
standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet in Other liabilities. Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending 
commitments flow through the Consolidated Statement of Income on the 
line Provision for unfunded lending commitments.For a further description of the loan loss reserve and related accounts, see ﬁManaging Global RiskŠCredit Riskﬂ and Notes 1 and 17 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.136SECURITIZATIONS Citigroup securitizes a number of different asset classes as a means of strengthening its balance sheet and accessing competitive financing rates 
in the market. Under these securitization programs, assets are transferred 
into a trust and used as collateral by the trust to obtain financing. The cash 
flows from assets in the trust service the corresponding trust securities. If 
the structure of the trust meets certain accounting guidelines, trust assets 
are treated as sold and are no longer reflected as assets of Citi. If these 
guidelines are not met, the assets continue to be recorded as Citi™s assets, 
with the financing activity recorded as liabilities on Citigroup™s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Citigroup also assists its clients in securitizing their financial assets and packages and securitizes financial assets purchased in the financial markets. 
Citi may also provide administrative, asset management, underwriting, 
liquidity facilities and/or other services to the resulting securitization entities 
and may continue to service some of these financial assets.Elimination of Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) and Changes in the Consolidation Model for VIEsIn June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166, now incorporated into ASC Topic 860) and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167, now incorporated into ASC Topic 810). Citigroup adopted both standards on January 1, 2010. Citigroup 
has elected to apply SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 prospectively. Accordingly, prior 
periods have not been restated.SFAS 166 eliminates the concept of QSPEs from U.S. GAAP and amends 
the guidance on accounting for tranfers of financial assets. SFAS 167 

details three key changes to the consolidation model. First, former QSPEs 
are now included in the scope of SFAS 167. Second, the FASB has changed 

the method of analyzing which party to a VIE should consolidate the VIE 
(known as the primary beneficiary) to a qualitative determination of which 
party to the VIE has ﬁpower,ﬂ combined with potentially significant benefits 

or losses, instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model. The 
party that has ﬁpowerﬂ has the ability to direct the activities of the VIE that 
most significantly impact the VIE™s economic performance. Third, the new 

standard requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be re-evaluated 
whenever circumstances change. The previous rules required reconsideration 
of the primary beneficiary only when specified reconsideration 
events occurred. As a result of implementing these new accounting standards, Citigroup consolidated certain of the VIEs and former QSPEs with which it currently 
has involvement. Further, certain asset transfers, including transfers of 

portions of assets, that would have been considered sales under SFAS 140, are 

considered secured borrowings under the new standards. In accordance with SFAS 167, Citigroup employed three approaches for 
newly consolidating certain VIEs and former QSPEs as of January 1, 2010. 
The first approach required initially measuring the assets, liabilities, and 
noncontrolling interests of the VIEs and former QSPEs at their carrying 
values (the amounts at which the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests would have been carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements, if 

Citigroup had always consolidated these VIEs and former QSPEs). The second 
approach measures assets at their unpaid principal amount, and was applied 
where using carrying values was not practicable. The third approach was to 
elect the fair value option, in which all of the financial assets and liabilities 
of certain designated VIEs and former QSPEs were recorded at fair value upon 

adoption of SFAS 167 and continue to be marked to market thereafter, with 

changes in fair value reported in earnings. Citigroup consolidated all required VIEs and former QSPEs, as of January 1, 2010, at carrying values or unpaid principal amounts, except for 
certain private label residential mortgage and mutual fund deferred sales 
commissions VIEs, for which the fair value option was elected. The following 
tables present the impact of adopting these new accounting standards 
applying these approaches. The incremental impact of these changes on GAAP assets and resulting risk-weighted assets for those VIEs and former QSPEs that were consolidated 
or deconsolidated for accounting purposes as of January 1, 2010 was 
as follows:IncrementalIn billions of dollarsGAAP assetsRisk- weighted assets(1)Impact of consolidation$ 86.3$ 0.8

$712.0 billion), and (ii) the assets of significant VIEs as of January 1, 2010 
with which Citigroup is involved (totaling approximately $219.2 billion) that 
were previously unconsolidated and are required to be consolidated under 
the new accounting standards. Due to the variety of transaction structures 
and the level of Citigroup involvement in individual former QSPEs and VIEs, 
only a portion of the former QSPEs and VIEs with which Citi is involved were 
required to be consolidated.In addition, the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of January 1, 2010 resulted in an aggregate after-tax charge 

to Retained earnings of $8.4 billion, reflecting the net effect of an 
overall pretax charge to Retained earnings (primarily relating to the 
establishment of loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held) 
of $13.4 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting 
to $5.0 billion. The impact on certain of Citigroup™s regulatory capital ratios of adopting 
these new accounting standards, reflecting immediate implementation of 
the recently issued final risk-based capital rules regarding SFAS 166/167, was 

as follows:As of January 1, 2010

ASU 2010-10 provides a deferral to the requirements of SFAS 167 where the following criteria are met:the entity being evaluated for consolidation is an investment company, as defined, or an entity for which it is acceptable based on industry practice 
to apply measurement principles that are consistent with an investment 
company;the reporting enterprise does not have an explicit or implicit obligation to fund losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity; and
the entity being evaluated for consolidation is not:Œ a securitization entity;Œ an asset-backed financing entity; orŒ an entity that was formerly considered a qualifying special-purpose entity.
Citigroup has determined that a majority of the investment vehicles managed 
by it are provided a deferral from the requirements of SFAS 167 as they meet 
these criteria. These vehicles continue to be evaluated under the requirements 

of FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10), prior to the implementation of SFAS 167.Where Citi has determined that certain investment vehicles are subject to the consolidation requirements of SFAS 167, the consolidation conclusions 

reached upon initial application of SFAS 167 are consistent with the 

consolidation conclusions reached under the requirements of ASC 810-10, 
prior to the implementation of SFAS 167. 
138GOODWILLCitigroup has recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet Goodwill of $26.2 billion (1.4% of assets) and $25.4 billion (1.4% of assets) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. No goodwill 
impairment was recorded during 2009 and 2010. A $9.6 billion goodwill 
impairment charge was recorded in 2008 as a result of testing performed 
as of December 31, 2008. The impairment was composed of a $2.3 billion 
pretax charge ($2.0 billion after tax) related to North America Regional Consumer Bank, a $4.3 billion pretax charge ($4.1 billion after tax) related 
to Latin America Regional Consumer Bank and a $3.0 billion pretax 
charge ($2.6 billion after tax) related to Local Consumer LendingŠOther.Goodwill is allocated to Citi™s reporting units at the date the goodwill is 
initially recorded. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, 
it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, 
but instead becomes identified with the reporting unit as a whole. As a result, 
all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of 
goodwill allocated to the unit. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup operated 
in three core business segments, as discussed. Goodwill impairment testing is 
performed at the reporting unit level, one level below the business segment.The reporting unit structure in 2010 was consistent with the reporting units identified in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the change in 
Citi™s organizational structure. During 2010, goodwill was allocated to 

disposals and tested for impairment under these reporting units. The nine 
reporting units were North America Regional Consumer Banking, EMEA 
Regional Consumer Banking, Asia Regional Consumer Banking, LATAM 

Regional Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking, Transaction 

Services, Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer LendingŠ
Cards and Local Consumer LendingŠOther.
Under ASC 350, IntangiblesŠGoodwill and Other, the goodwill impairment analysis is done in two steps. The first step requires a comparison 
of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to its carrying value, 
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the 
carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and 
no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit 

exceeds the fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and a 
second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if 
any, for that reporting unit.
When required, the second step of testing involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for each of the affected reporting units. The implied 
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of 
goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the 
fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value 
of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were 
being acquired. If the amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill in the pro forma purchase price 
allocation, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. A recognized impairment charge subsequently cannot exceed the amount of goodwill 
allocated to a reporting unit and cannot be reversed even if the fair value of 
the reporting unit recovers.Goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be 
supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit using widely 
accepted valuation techniques, such as the market approach (earnings 
multiples and/or transaction multiples) and/or the income approach 
(discounted cash flow (DCF) method). In applying these methodologies, Citi 
utilizes a number of factors, including actual operating results, future 
business plans, economic projections, and market data. Management 
may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in Citi™s 

valuation process.As a result of significant adverse changes during 2008 in certain Citigroup reporting units, and the increase in financial sector volatility primarily in the 
U.S., Citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist 
to assist in Citi™s valuation of all or a portion of the following reporting 

units during 2009ŠNorth America Regional Consumer Banking, Latin 
America Regional Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking, Local 
Consumer LendingŠCards
 and Local Consumer LendingŠOther. In addition to employing the market approach for estimating the fair value 
for the selected reporting units in 2009, the DCF method was incorporated 
to ensure reliability of results. Consistent with 2009, Citigroup engaged the 
services of an independent valuation specialist in 2010 to assist in Citi™s 

valuation of the same reporting units employing both the market approach 
and DCF method. Citi believes that the DCF method, using management 
projections for the selected reporting units and an appropriate risk-adjusted 
discount rate, is most reflective of a market participant™s view of fair values 

given current market conditions. For the reporting units where both methods 
were utilized in 2010, the resulting fair values were relatively consistent and 
appropriate weighting was given to outputs from both methods.The DCF method used at the time of each impairment test used discount rates that Citi believes adequately reflected the risk and uncertainty in the 
financial markets generally and specifically in the internally generated cash 
flow projections. The DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in 
estimating the discount rate. Citi continues to value the remaining reporting 
units where it believes the risk of impairment to be low, using primarily the 

market approach. Citi prepares a formal three-year strategic plan for its businesses on an annual basis. These projections incorporate certain external economic 
projections developed at the point in time the strategic plan is developed. For 
the purpose of performing any impairment test, the three-year forecast is 
updated by Citi to reflect current economic conditions as of the testing date. 
Citi used updated long-range financial forecasts as a basis for its annual 
goodwill impairment test performed as of July 1, 2010. 139The results of the July 1, 2010 test validated that the fair values exceeded the carrying values for all reporting units. Citi is also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances make it more 
likely than not that impairment may have occurred, such as a significant 
adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all 
or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant decline in Citi™s 

stock price. An interim goodwill impairment test was performed for the 
Brokerage and Asset Management reporting unit as of May 1, 2010 in light 
of significant sales transactions impacting the size of the reporting unit. 
Results of the test indicated no goodwill impairment. Based on negative 
regulatory changes during 2010, including the penalty fee provision 
associated with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure 
Act of 2009 (CARD Act), Citigroup performed an interim impairment test for 
its Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
reporting unit as of May 31, 2010. 
The test validated that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of 
the associated carrying value and, therefore, that there was no indication of 
goodwill impairment.Since none of the Company™s reporting units are publicly traded, 
individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly 
correlated to Citigroup™s stock price. The sum of the fair values of the 

reporting units at July 1, 2010 significantly exceeded the overall market 
capitalization of Citi as of July 1, 2010. However, Citi believes that it was 

not meaningful to reconcile the sum of the fair values of the Company™s 

reporting units to its market capitalization during the 2010 annual 
impairment test performed on July 1, 2010 due to several factors. These 
factors, which do not directly impact the individual reporting unit fair values 
as of July 1, 2010, included the continued economic stake and influence held 
by the U.S. government in Citi at the time the annual test was performed. In 
addition, the market capitalization of Citigroup reflects the execution risk 
in a transaction involving Citigroup due to its size. However, the individual 

reporting units™ fair values are not subject to the same level of execution risk 
or a business model that is perceived to be complex.While no impairment was noted in step one of Citigroup™s 
Local Consumer LendingŠCards
 reporting unit impairment test at July 1, 
2010, goodwill present in the reporting unit may be sensitive to further 
deterioration as the valuation of the reporting unit is particularly dependent 
upon economic conditions that affect consumer credit risk and behavior. 

Citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist 
in the valuation of the reporting unit at July 1, 2010, using a combination 
of the market approach and income approach consistent with the valuation 
model used in past practice, which considered the impact of the penalty fee 
provisions associated with the CARD Act that were implemented during 2010. Under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit, the key assumption is the selected price multiple. The selection of the multiple considers the operating performance and financial condition of the Local Consumer LendingŠCards
 operations as compared with those of a group 
of selected publicly traded guideline companies and a group of selected 
acquired companies. Among other factors, the level and expected growth in 
return on tangible equity relative to those of the guideline companies and 
guideline transactions is considered. Since the guideline company prices 
used are on a minority interest basis, the selection of the multiple considers 
the guideline acquisition prices which reflect control rights and privileges in 
arriving at a multiple that reflects an appropriate control premium. For the Local Consumer LendingŠCards
 valuation under the income approach, the assumptions used as the basis for the model include cash 
flows for the forecasted period, the assumptions embedded in arriving at 
an estimation of the terminal value and the discount rate. The cash flows 
for the forecasted period are estimated based on management™s most recent 

projections available as of the testing date, giving consideration to targeted 
equity capital requirements based on selected public guideline companies 
for the reporting unit. In arriving at the terminal value for Local Consumer LendingŠCards
, using 2013 as the terminal year, the assumptions used 

included a long-term growth rate and a price-to-tangible book multiple 
based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit. The 
discount rate is based on the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity capital 

computed under the capital asset pricing model.Embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model, described above, is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility 
that economic conditions may deteriorate or other events will occur that 
will impact the business model for Local Consumer LendingŠCards
. 
While there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in 
developing management™s forecasts, the Company utilized a discount rate at 

July 1, 2010 that it believes reflects the risk characteristics and uncertainty 
specific to management™s forecasts and assumptions for the 
Local Consumer 
LendingŠCards
 reporting unit. Two primary categories of events existŠeconomic conditions in the 
U.S. and regulatory actionsŠwhich, if they were to turn out worse than 
management has projected, could negatively affect key assumptions used in 
the valuation of Local Consumer LendingŠCards
. Small deterioration 
in the assumptions used in the valuations, in particular the discount-rate 
and growth-rate assumptions used in the net income projections, could 
significantly affect Citigroup™s impairment evaluation and, hence, results. 

If the future were to differ adversely from management™s best estimate of 

key economic assumptions, and associated cash flows were to decrease by a 
small margin, Citi could potentially experience future material impairment 
charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in its Local Consumer LendingŠCards
 reporting unit. Any such charges, by themselves, would 
not negatively affect Citi™s Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Common or Total Capital 

regulatory ratios, or Tier 1 Common ratio, its Tangible Common Equity or 

Citi™s liquidity position.
140INCOME TAXESCitigroup is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and local municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which Citi operates. These tax 
laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer 
and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision 
for income tax expense, Citi must make judgments and interpretations about 
the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Citi must also make 
estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in 
the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be 
settled with the taxing authority upon audit. Deferred taxes are recorded for 
the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial 
statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred 
tax assets (DTAs) are recognized subject to management™s judgment that 

realization is more likely than not. At December 31, 2010, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately 
$52.1 billion, an increase of $6.0 billion from $46.1 billion at December 31, 
2009. Excluding the impact of the adoption of SFAS 166/167, the DTAs 

increased $1.0 billion during 2010. The adoption of SFAS 166/167 on 

January 1, 2010 resulted in an increase to the DTAs of approximately 

$5.0 billion related to the loan losses recorded upon consolidation of Citi™s 

credit card trusts.Although realization is not assured, Citigroup believes that the realization of the recognized net DTAs of $52.1
 billion at December 31, 2010 is more 
likely than not based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the 
jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, and based on available tax planning 

strategies, as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes
, that would be implemented, 
if necessary, to prevent a carryforward from expiring. 
The following table summarizes Citi™s net DTAs balance at December 31,

 billion are deferred tax liabilities of $4 billion that will reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may be used to support the DTAs, and $0.3
 billion in compensation 
deductions that reduced additional paid-in capital in January 2011 and 
for which no adjustment to such DTAs is permitted at December 31, 2010, 

because the related stock compensation was not yet deductible to Citi. In 
general, Citi would need to generate approximately $105 billion of taxable 
income during the respective carryforward periods to fully realize its U.S. 
federal, state and local DTAs. 
141As a result of the losses incurred in 2008 and 2009, Citi is in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position at December 31, 2010. A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the 
realizability of a DTA. Citi has concluded that there is sufficient positive 

evidence to overcome this negative evidence. The positive evidence includes 
two means by which Citi is able to fully realize its DTAs. First, Citi forecasts 

sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period, exclusive of tax 
planning strategies, even under stressed scenarios. Second, Citi has sufficient 
tax planning strategies, including potential sales of businesses and assets, in 
which it could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its 
assets. The amount of the DTAs considered realizable, however, is necessarily 

subject to Citi™s estimates of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in 

which it operates during the respective carryforward periods, which is in turn 
subject to overall market and global economic conditions.Based upon the foregoing discussion, as well as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below, Citi believes that the U.S. 

federal and New York state and city net operating loss carryforward period of 

20 years provides enough time to utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing 

net operating loss carryforwards and any NOL that would be created by 
the reversal of the future net deductions that have not yet been taken on a 
tax return. The U.S. federal NOL carryforward component of the DTAs of 

$3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 is expected to be utilized in 2011 based 
upon Citi™s current expectations of future taxable income.
The U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward period is 10 years. In addition, utilization of foreign tax credits in any year is restricted to 35% of foreign 
source taxable income in that year. Further, overall domestic losses that 

Citi has incurred of approximately $47 billion are allowed to be reclassified 
as foreign source income to the extent of 50% of domestic source income 
produced in subsequent years and such resulting foreign source income 
would in fact be sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits being carried 
forward. As such, the foreign source taxable income limitation will not be an 
impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long as Citi can 
generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the 10-year carryforward 
period. Under U.S. tax law, NOL carry-forwards must generally be used 

against taxable income before foreign tax credits (FTCs) or general business 
credits (GBCs) can be utilized. Regarding the estimate of future taxable income, Citi has projected its pretax earnings, predominantly based upon the ﬁcoreﬂ businesses in Citicorp 
that Citi intends to conduct going forward. These ﬁcoreﬂ businesses have 
produced steady and strong earnings in the past. Citi has already taken steps 
to reduce its cost structure. In 2010, operating trends were positive and credit costs improved. Taking these items into account, Citi is projecting that it will 

generate sufficient pretax earnings within the 10-year carryforward period 
referenced above to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward, 
in addition to any foreign tax credits produced in such period. Until the 
U.S. federal NOL carryforward is fully utilized, the FTCs and GBCs will likely 
continue to increase. Citi™s net DTAs will decline as additional domestic GAAP 

taxable income is generated. Citi has also examined tax planning strategies available to it in accordance with ASC 740 that would be employed, if necessary, to prevent a 

carryforward from expiring. These strategies include repatriating low-taxed 
foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings have 
been indefinitely reinvested has not been made, accelerating U.S. taxable 
income into or deferring U.S. tax deductions out of the latter years of the 
carryforward period (e.g., selling appreciated intangible assets and electing 
straight-line depreciation), accelerating deductible temporary differences 
outside the U.S., holding onto available-for-sale debt securities with losses 

until they mature and selling certain assets that produce tax-exempt income, 
while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income. In addition, 
the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant U.S. 
taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods. Citi™s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be 
significantly limited if Citi experiences an ﬁownership change,ﬂ as defined in 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ﬁCodeﬂ). 
See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for a further description of Citi™s tax provision and related income tax assets 

and liabilities.Approximately $13 billion of the net DTA is included in Tier 1 Common 
and Tier 1 Capital.
LEGAL RESERVES See the discussion in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
information regarding Citi™s policies on establishing reserves for legal and 
regulatory claims.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND FUTURE APPLICATION 
OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion 
of ﬁAccounting Changesﬂ and the ﬁFuture Application of Accounting 
Standards.ﬂ142DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESCitigroup™s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the 
time periods specified in the SEC™s rules and forms, including without 
limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings, 
is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to 
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Citi™s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their 
responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness 
of Citi™s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee 

is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and 

implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the 
supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO. Citigroup™s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has 
evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup™s disclosure controls and procedures 

(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 
2010 and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at 
that date Citigroup™s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
143The management of Citigroup is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Citi™s 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Citi™s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly 
reflect the transaction and dispositions of Citi™s assets; (ii) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that Citi™s receipts and expenditures are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of Citi™s management and directors; and 
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Citi™s assets that could have 
a material effect on its financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.MANAGEMENT™S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTINGCitigroup management assessed the effectiveness of Citigroup™s internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the 
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 

Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 
2010, Citigroup™s internal control over financial reporting was effective. In 

addition, there were no changes in Citigroup™s internal control over financial 

reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010 that materially 
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Citi™s internal control 

over financial reporting.The effectiveness of Citigroup™s internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, Citigroup™s 

independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report below, 

which expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Citigroup™s 

internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.144FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements in this Form 10-K, including but not limited to statements included within the Management™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations, are ﬁforward-looking statementsﬂ 
within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the SEC. Generally, 
forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead 
represent only Citigroup™s and management's beliefs regarding future 
events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may 
differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of 
factors, including without limitation the precautionary statements included 
in this Form 10-K, the factors listed and described under ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ 
above, and the factors described below:the impact of the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Financial Reform Act) 
on Citi™s business activities and practices, costs of operations and overall 
results of operations;the impact of increases in FDIC insurance premiums on Citi™s earnings and competitive position, in the U.S. and globally;Citi™s ability to maintain, or the increased cost of maintaining, adequate capital in light of changing regulatory capital requirements pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, the capital standards adopted by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (including as implemented by U.S. 
regulators) or otherwise;disruption to, and potential adverse impact to the results of operations of, certain areas of Citi™s derivatives business structures and practices as result of the central clearing, exchange trading and ﬁpush-outﬂ provisions of 
the Financial Reform Act;the potential negative impacts to Citi of regulatory requirements aimed at facilitation of the orderly resolution of large financial institutions, as required under the Financial Reform Act;risks arising from Citi™s extensive operations outside the U.S., including compliance with conflicting or inconsistent regulations and Citi™s ability to continue to compete effectively with competitors who may face fewer 
regulatory constraints;the impact of recently enacted and potential future regulations on Citi™s ability and costs to participate in securitization transactions;a reduction in Citi™s or its subsidiaries™ credit ratings, including in response to the passage of the Financial Reform Act, and the potential impact on Citi™s funding and liquidity, borrowing costs and access to the 
capital markets, among other factors;the impact of restrictions imposed on proprietary trading and funds-related activities by the Financial Reform Act, including the potential negative impact on Citi™s market-making activities and its global 
competitive position with respect to its trading activities;increased compliance costs and possible changes to Citi™s practices and operations with respect to a number of its U.S. Consumer businesses as a result of the Financial Reform Act and the establishment of the new 
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection;the continued impact of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 as well as other regulatory requirements on Citi™s credit card businesses and business models;the exposure of Citi, as originator of residential mortgage loans, sponsor of residential mortgage-backed securitization transactions or servicer of such loans, or in such transactions, or in other capacities, to government 
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), investors, mortgage insurers, or other third 
parties as a result of representations and warranties made in connection 
with the transfer or securitization of such loans;the outcome of inquiries and proceedings by governmental entities, or judicial and regulatory decisions, regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry, including among other things the processes followed 
for foreclosing residential mortgages and mortgage transfer and 
securitization processes, and any potential impact on Citi™s foreclosures 
in process;the continued uncertainty about the sustainability and pace of the economic recovery, including continued disruption in the global financial markets and the potential impact on consumer credit, on Citi™s businesses 
and results of operations;Citi™s ability to maintain adequate liquidity in light of changing liquidity standards in the U.S. or abroad, and the impact of maintaining adequate liquidity on Citi™s net interest margin (NIM);145an ﬁownership changeﬂ under the Internal Revenue Code and its effect on Citi™s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets (DTAs) to offset future taxable income;the potential negative impact on the value of Citi™s DTAs if corporate tax rates in the U.S., or certain foreign jurisdictions, are decreased;the expiration of a provision of the U.S. tax law allowing Citi to defer U.S. taxes on certain active financial services income and its effect on Citi™s tax expense;Citi™s ability to continue to wind down Citi Holdings at the same pace or level as in the past and its ability to reduce risk-weighted assets and limit its expenses as a result;Citi™s ability to continue to control expenses, including through reductions at Citi Holdings, and to fund investments intended to grow the operations of Citicorp;Citi™s ability to hire and retain qualified employees as a result of regulatory uncertainty regarding compensation practices or otherwise;Citi™s ability to predict or estimate the outcome or exposure of the extensive legal and regulatory proceedings to which it is subject, and the potential for the ﬁwhistleblowerﬂ provisions of the Financial Reform 
Act to further increase Citi™s number of, and exposure to, legal and 
regulatory proceedings;potential future changes in key accounting standards utilized by Citi and their impact on how Citi records and reports its financial condition and 
results of operations;the accuracy of Citi™s assumptions and estimates, including in determining credit loss reserves, litigation and regulatory exposures, mortgage representation and warranty claims and the fair value of certain 
assets, used to prepare its financial statements;Citi™s ability to maintain effective risk management processes and strategies to protect against losses, which can be increased by concentration of risk, particularly with Citi™s counter parties in the 
financial sector;a failure in Citi™s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties; and
Citi™s ability to maintain the value of the Citi brand.146REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMŠ INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.:We have audited Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries™ (the ﬁCompanyﬂ or ﬁCitigroupﬂ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlŠIntegrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company™s management is responsible 
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in the accompanying management™s report on internal control 
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company™s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a 

reasonable basis for our opinion.A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s 

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that 

could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Citigroup maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on 
criteria established in Internal ControlŠIntegrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of Citigroup as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the 
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders™ 
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended 
December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an 
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. New York, New York February 25, 2011147REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMŠ CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the ﬁCompanyﬂ or ﬁCitigroupﬂ) as of December 31, 
2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes 
in stockholders™ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year 
period ended December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated balance 
sheets of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 
2009. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company™s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for 

our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citigroup as 

of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, 
and the financial position of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 
31, 2010 and 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles.As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2010 the Company changed its method of accounting for qualifying special 
purpose entities, variable interest entities and embedded credit derivatives, 
and in 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for other-than-

temporary impairments on investment securities, business combinations, 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and earnings per share. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Citigroup™s internal 

control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria 
established in Internal ControlŠIntegrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 

(COSO), and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company™s internal control over 

financial reporting.New York, New York

159NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it 
holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where 
it exercises control. Entities where the Company holds 20% to 50% of the 
voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence, other 
than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries, or investments 
accounted for at fair value under the fair value option, are accounted for 
under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is 
included in Other revenue. Income from investments in less than 20%-
owned companies is recognized when dividends are received. As discussed 
below, Citigroup consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities 
when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and 
losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings, and 
other investments and charges for management™s estimate of impairment in 
their value that is other than temporary, such that recovery of the carrying 
amount is deemed unlikely, are included in Other revenue. Throughout these Notes, ﬁCitigroupﬂ, ﬁCitiﬂ and ﬁthe Companyﬂ refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior-period™s financial 
statements and notes to conform to the current period™s presentation. 
Citibank, N.A.Citibank, N.A. is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of 
Citigroup Inc. Citibank™s principal offerings include Consumer finance, 
mortgage lending, and retail banking products and services; investment 
banking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance 
and e-commerce products and services; and private banking products 
and services. The Company includes a balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholder™s equity for Citibank, N.A. to provide information about this 

entity to shareholders and international regulatory agencies. (See Note 30 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Variable Interest EntitiesAn entity is referred to as a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets the criteria 
outlined in ASC 810, 
Consolidation (formerly FASB Interpretation No.
 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) (FIN 46(R)) and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167), which are: (1) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit 
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial 
support from other parties, or (2) the entity has equity investors that cannot 
make significant decisions about the entity™s operations or that do not absorb 
their proportionate share of the expected losses or receive the expected returns 
of the entity. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Company consolidated a VIE if it had a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns 
or both. As of January 1, 2010, when the Company adopted SFAS 167™s 
amendments to the VIE consolidation guidance, the Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly 
impact the VIE™s economic success and a right to receive benefits or absorb 
losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. Along with the VIEs that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines, the Company has variable interests in other VIEs that are 
not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. 

These include multi-seller finance companies, certain collateralized debt 
obligations (CDOs), many structured finance transactions, and various 
investment funds. However, these VIEs as well as all other unconsolidated VIEs are 
continually monitored by the Company to determine if any events have 
occurred that could cause its primary beneficiary status to change. These 
events include: additional purchases or sales of variable interests by Citigroup or an unrelated third party, which cause Citigroup™s overall variable interest 
ownership to change; changes in contractual arrangements in a manner that reallocates expected losses and residual returns among the variable interest holders; 
changes in the party that has power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity™s economic performance; and
providing support to an entity that results in an implicit variable interest. All other entities not deemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are evaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810 (formerly Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, SFAS No.
 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned 
Subsidiaries, and EITF Issue No. 04-5, ﬁDetermining Whether a General 
Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership 

or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rightsﬂ). Foreign Currency TranslationAssets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective 
functional currencies into U.S. dollars using period-end spot foreign-
exchange rates. Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated 
monthly from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at 
amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates. The effects 
of those translation adjustments are reported in a separate component of 
stockholders™ equity, along with related hedge and tax effects, until realized 
upon sale or liquidation of the foreign operation. For transactions whose terms are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, including transactions denominated in the local 

currencies of foreign operations with the U.S. dollar as their functional 
currency, the effects of changes in exchange rates are primarily included in 

Other revenue, along with the related hedge effects. Instruments used to 
hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign currency forward, option 
and swap contracts and designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Foreign 
operations in countries with highly inflationary economies designate the U.S. 
dollar as their functional currency, with the effects of changes in exchange 

rates primarily included in Other revenue.160Investment SecuritiesInvestments include fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income instruments include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as 
certain loan-backed and structured securities that are subject to prepayment 
risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stock. 
Investment securities are classified and accounted for as follows: Fixed income securities classified as ﬁheld-to-maturityﬂ represent securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold 
until maturity, and are carried at amortized cost. Interest income on such 
securities is included in Interest revenue. Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities classified as ﬁavailable-for-saleﬂ are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in a separate component of Stockholders™ equity, net of 
applicable income taxes. As described in more detail in Note 15 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, credit-related declines in fair value 
that are determined to be other than temporary are recorded in earnings 
immediately. Realized gains and losses on sales are included in income 
primarily on a specific identification cost basis, and interest and dividend 
income on such securities is included in Interest revenue. Venture capital investments held by Citigroup™s private equity subsidiaries that are considered investment companies are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in Other revenue. These subsidiaries 
include entities registered as Small Business Investment Companies and 
engage exclusively in venture capital activities. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities and certain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair value, since the Company has elected to 
apply fair value accounting. Changes in fair value of such investments are 
recorded in earnings. Certain non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost and periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment, as set out in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.For investments in fixed-income securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, accrual of interest income is suspended for investments 
that are in default or on which it is likely that future interest payments will 
not be made as scheduled. The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value, which are described in Note 25 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Trading Account Assets and LiabilitiesTrading account assets include debt and marketable equity securities, 
derivatives in a receivable position, residual interests in securitizations 
and physical commodities inventory. In addition (as set out in Note 26 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements), certain assets that Citigroup has 
elected to carry at fair value under the fair value option, such as loans and 
purchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account assets. Trading account liabilities
 include securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions), and derivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain 
liabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value, as set out in 
Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than physical commodities inventory, all trading account assets 
and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading 
assets and trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses 
resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Interest income 
on trading assets is recorded in Interest revenue reduced by interest expense 
on trading liabilities.Physical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM) with related gains or losses reported in Principal transactions. 
Realized gains and losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in 
Principal transactions. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, 
equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, 

warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. 
Derivative asset and liability positions are presented net by counterparty on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement exists 
and the other conditions set out in ASC 210-20, Balance SheetŠOffsetting are met. The Company uses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities, all of which are described in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Securities Borrowed and Securities LoanedSecurities borrowing and lending transactions generally do not constitute a 
sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes, and so are treated 
as collateralized financing transactions when the transaction involves 
the exchange of cash. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of 
cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. As set out in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply 
fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending 
transactions. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair value 
accounting, fees paid or received for all securities lending and borrowing 
transactions are recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the 
contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20 are met, amounts recognized in respect of securities borrowed and securities loaned are presented net on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. With respect to securities borrowed or loaned, the Company pays or receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of 
securities borrowed or loaned. The Company monitors the market value of 
securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral 
received or paid as necessary. 
As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value 
of securities lending and borrowing transactions.161Repurchase and Resale AgreementsSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities 
purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) generally do not constitute 

a sale for accounting purposes of the underlying securities, and so are treated as 

collateralized financing transactions. As set out in Note 26 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting 

to a majority of such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in 

earnings. Any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected 

are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. 

Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, interest 

paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest 

expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. 
Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance SheetŠOffsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements, are met, repos and 
reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company™s policy is to take possession of securities purchased under 
agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and 
resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate 
to protect against credit exposure. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value 
of repo and reverse repo transactions. Repurchase and Resale Agreements, and Securities 
Lending and Borrowing Agreements Accounted for  
as SalesWhere certain conditions are met under ASC 860-10, Transfers and Servicing 
(formerly FASB Statement No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial 
Assets), the Company accounts for certain repurchase agreements and 
securities lending agreements as sales. The key distinction resulting in these 
agreements being accounted for as sales is a reduction in initial margin 
or restriction in daily maintenance margin. At December 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009, $0.2 billion and $13.0 billion of these transactions, 
respectively, were accounted for as sales that reduced trading account assets. 
Included in the December 31, 2009 amount is $5.7 billion of repurchase and 
securities lending agreements that were accounted for as sales in error. As of 
December 31, 2009, this error constituted 0.3% of Total assets, 0.3% of Total liabilities and 3.7% of Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or 
sold under agreements to repurchase. There was no impact on Net income 
(loss) in any period. Management believes that this error was immaterial to 
Citigroup™s financial statements during all periods at issue. Commencing 
in the first quarter of 2010, the Company has prospectively changed the 
accounting for these repurchase and securities lending transactions so that 
the accounting reflects a secured borrowing transaction, thus conforming the 
accounting to the transaction terms.LoansLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any 
unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs except that 
credit card receivable balances also include accrued interest and fees. Loan 
origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred 
and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans. As described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Citi has elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair 
value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest income on 
such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans for which the fair value option has not been elected are classified upon origination or acquisition as either held-for-investment or held-for-sale. 

This classification is based on management™s initial intent and ability with 

regard to those loans. Loans that are held-for-investment are classified as 
Loans, net of unearned income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related 
cash flows are included within the cash flows from investing activities 
category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in loans. However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has changed 

from held-for-investment to held-for-sale, the loan is reclassified to held-for-

sale, but the related cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from 
investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line 
Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans. Substantially all of the Consumer loans sold or securitized by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans or U.S. credit card receivables. The 
practice of the U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell substantially 
all of its loans except for non-conforming adjustable rate loans. U.S. prime 
mortgage conforming loans are classified as held-for-sale at the time 

of origination. The related cash flows are classified in the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from operating activities category 
on the line Change in loans held-for-sale
. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 166/167 in 2010, U.S. credit card 
receivables were classified at origination as loans-held-for-sale to the extent 

that management did not have the intent to hold the receivables for the 
foreseeable future or until maturity. Prior to 2010, the U.S. credit card 

securitization forecast for the three months following the latest balance 
sheet date, excluding replenishments, was the basis for the amount of such 
loans classified as held-for-sale. Cash flows related to U.S. credit card loans 

classified as held-for-sale at origination or acquisition are reported in the 

cash flows from operating activities category on the line Change in loans held-for-sale
. 162
Consumer loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily by the 
Regional Consumer Banking
 and 
Local Consumer Lending
 businesses. 
As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both 
open- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90 days contractually past 
due. For credit cards and unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally 
accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. Loans that have 
been modified to grant a short-term or long-term concession to a borrower 
who is in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of 
the modification. The policy for returning such modified loans to accrual 
status varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number 
of payments (ranging from one to six) are required, while in other cases the 
loan is never returned to accrual status. 
The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current status 
varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to qualify for these 
modifications is that a minimum number of payments (typically ranging 
from one to three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer 
loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For such open-ended consumer 
loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the loan to be 
re-aged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly 
payments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under 
FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is 
subject to limitations (generally once in twelve months and twice in five 
years). Furthermore, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies™ 
guidelines and payments are not always required in order to re-age a 
modified loan to current
. 
Citi™s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:
Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120 days past due. 

Unsecured revolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at 

180 days contractually past due. 
Loans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down to the 

estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days past due. 
Real estate-secured loans are written down to the estimated value of the 

property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. 
Non-bank loans secured by real estate are written down to the estimated 

value of the property, less costs to sell, at the earlier of the receipt of title or 
12 months in foreclosure (a process that must commence when payments 
are 120
 
days contractually past due). 
Non-bank auto loans are written down to the estimated value of the 

collateral, less costs to sell, at repossession or, if repossession is not 
pursued, no later than 180 days contractually past due. 
Non-bank unsecured personal loans are charged off when the loan is 

180
 
days contractually past due if there have been no payments within 
the last six months, but in no event can these loans exceed 360 days 
contractually past due. 
Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 60 days of 

notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or within the contractual 
write-off periods, whichever occurs earlier. 
Real estate-secured loans in bankruptcy are written down to the estimated 

value of the property, less costs to sell, at the later of 60 days after 
notification or 60 days contractually past due.
Non-bank unsecured personal loans in bankruptcy are charged off when 

they are 30
 
days contractually past due. 
Commercial market loans are written down to the extent that principal is 

judged to be uncollectable.
Corporate loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by 
ICG
 or the 
Special 
Asset Pool
. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash 
(non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and 
a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that 
the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal 
is 90
 
days past due, except when the loan is well-collateralized and in the 
process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans 
and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, 
and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually 
received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability 
of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded 
investment in the
 
loan. 
Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent 
that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent 
loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by 
the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and 
reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of cost or 
collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when 
all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of 
repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in 
accordance with the contractual terms.
Loans 
H
eld-for-Sale
Corporate and Consumer loans that have been identified for sale are 
classified as loans held-for-sale included in 
Other assets
. With the exception 
of certain mortgage loans for which the fair value option has been elected, 
these loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value (LOCOM), 
with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to 
Other revenue
. 
A
llowance for Loan Losses
Allowance for loan losses represents management™s best estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable losses related to large 
individually evaluated impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings. 
Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and the 
entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the 
overall portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made through the provision 
for loan losses. Loan losses are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent 
163recoveries are added. Securities received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss 
reflected as a recovery or charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently 
accounted for as securities available-for-sale. Corporate loansIn the corporate portfolios, the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-
specific component and a statistically-based component. The asset-specific 
component is calculated under ASC 310-10-35, ReceivablesŠSubsequent 
Measurement (formerly SFAS 114) on an individual basis for larger-
balance, non-homogeneous loans, which are considered impaired. An 
asset-specific allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, 
collateral value (less disposal costs), or observable market price of the 
impaired loan is lower than its carrying value. This allowance considers the 
borrower™s overall financial condition, resources, and payment record, the 
prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors (discussed 
further below) and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. 
The asset-specific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired 
loans is calculated on a pool basis considering historical loss experience. 
The allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio is calculated under 
ASC 450, Contingencies (formerly SFAS 5) using a statistical methodology, 
supplemented by management judgment. The statistical analysis considers 
the portfolio™s size, remaining tenor, and credit quality as measured by 
internal risk ratings assigned to individual credit facilities, which reflect 
probability of default and loss given default. The statistical analysis considers 
historical default rates and historical loss severity in the event of default, 
including historical average levels and historical variability. The result is 
an estimated range for inherent losses. The best estimate within the range is 
then determined by management™s quantitative and qualitative assessment 
of current conditions, including general economic conditions, specific 
industry and geographic trends, and internal factors including portfolio 
concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators, and current and 
past underwriting standards. For both the asset-specific and the statistically based components of the allowance for loan losses, management may incorporate guarantor support. 
The financial wherewithal of the guarantor is evaluated, as applicable, 
based on net worth, cash flow statements and personal or company financial 
statements which are updated and reviewed at least annually. Citi seeks 

performance on guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business. 
Seeking performance entails obtaining satisfactory cooperation from the 
guarantor or borrower to achieve Citi™s strategy in the specific situation. This 

regular cooperation is indicative of pursuit and successful enforcement of 
the guarantee: the exposure is reduced without the expense and burden of 
pursuing a legal remedy. Enforcing a guarantee via legal action against the 

guarantor is not the primary means of resolving a troubled loan situation 
and rarely occurs. A guarantor™s reputation and willingness to work with 

Citigroup is evaluated based on the historical experience with the guarantor 
and the knowledge of the marketplace. In the rare event that the guarantor 
is unwilling or unable to perform or facilitate borrower cooperation, Citi 
pursues a legal remedy. If Citi does not pursue a legal remedy, it is because 
Citi does not believe that the guarantor has the financial wherewithal to 
perform regardless of legal action, or because there are legal limitations 
on simultaneously pursuing guarantors and foreclosure. A guarantor™s 

reputation does not impact our decision or ability to seek performance 
under guarantee.In cases where a guarantee is a factor in the assessment of loan losses, it is included via adjustment to the loan™s internal risk rating, which in 

turn is the basis for the adjustment to the statistically based component of 
the allowance for loan losses. To date, it is only in rare circumstances that 

an impaired commercial or CRE loan is carried at a value in excess of the 
appraised value due to a guarantee. When Citi™s monitoring of the loan indicates that the guarantor™s 
wherewithal to pay is uncertain or has deteriorated, there is either no 
change in the risk rating, because the guarantor™s credit support was never 

initially factored in, or the risk rating is adjusted to reflect that uncertainty 
or deterioration. Accordingly, a guarantor™s ultimate failure to perform or 

a lack of legal enforcement of the guarantee does not materially impact 
the allowance for loan losses, as there is typically no further significant 
adjustment of the loan™s risk rating at that time. Where Citi is not seeking 

performance under the guarantee contract, it provides for loans losses as if 
the loans were non-performing and not guaranteed.Consumer loansFor Consumer loans, each portfolio of smaller-balance, homogeneous 
loansŠincluding Consumer mortgage, installment, revolving credit, and 
most other Consumer loansŠis independently evaluated for impairment. 
The allowance for loan losses attributed to these loans is established via a 
process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the specific portfolio 
based upon various analyses. These include migration analysis, in which 
historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current 
aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current trends 
and conditions. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators, including historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing, and classified loans, 
trends in volumes and terms of loans, an evaluation of overall credit quality, 

the credit process, including lending policies and procedures, and economic, 
geographical, product and other environmental factors. In addition, valuation allowances are determined for impaired smaller-
balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to the 
borrowers™ financial difficulties and where it has been determined that a 
concession was granted to the borrower. Such modifications may include 

interest rate reductions, principal forgiveness and/or term extensions. Where 
long-term concessions have been granted, such modifications are accounted 
for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The allowance for loan losses 
for TDRs is determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35 by comparing 
expected cash flows of the loans discounted at the loans™ original effective 
interest rates to the carrying value of the loans. Where short-term concessions 
have been granted, the allowance for loan losses is materially consistent with 
the requirements of ASC 310-10-35.164Loans included in the U.S. Treasury™s Home Affordable Modification 
Program (HAMP) trial period are not classified as modified under short-term or long-term programs, and the allowance for loan losses for these loans 
is calculated under ASC 450-20. The allowance calculation for HAMP trial 
loans uses default rates that assume that the borrower will not successfully 
complete the trial period and receive a permanent modification. Reserve Estimates and PoliciesManagement provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in 
the funded loan portfolio on the balance sheet in the form of an allowance 
for loan losses. These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroup™s 
credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors. Citi™s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer review the 
adequacy of the credit loss reserves each quarter with representatives from the 
Risk Management and Finance staffs for each applicable business area. The above-mentioned representatives covering the business areas having classifiably managed portfolios, where internal credit-risk ratings 
are assigned (primarily ICG, Regional Consumer Banking and Local 
Consumer Lending), or modified Consumer loans, where concessions were 
granted due to the borrowers™ financial difficulties, present recommended 
reserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending portfolios along with 
supporting quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data include: Estimated probable losses for non-performing, non-homogeneous exposures within a business line™s classifiably managed portfolio 
and impaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms 
have been modified due to the borrowers™ financial difficulties, and 
it was determined that a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration may be given to the following, as appropriate, when 
determining this estimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash 
flows discounted at the loan™s original effective rate; (ii) the borrower™s 
overall financial condition, resources and payment record; and (iii) the 
prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors or the 
realizable value of any collateral. In the determination of the allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs, management considers a combination of 
historical re-default rates, the current economic environment and the 
nature of the modification program when forecasting expected cash flows. 
When impairment is measured based on the present value of expected 
future cash flows, the entire change in present value is recorded in the 
Provision for loan losses.Statistically calculated losses inherent in the classifiably managed portfolio for performing and de minimis non-performing exposures. The calculation is based upon: (i) Citigroup™s internal system of credit-risk ratings, which are analogous to the risk ratings of the major rating 
agencies; and (ii) historical default and loss data, including rating agency 
information regarding default rates from 1983 to 2009 and internal data 
dating to the early 1970s on severity of losses in the event of default. Additional adjustments include: (i) statistically calculated estimates to cover the historical fluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, 
the historical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans, and 
the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations in the global 
portfolio; and (ii) adjustments made for specifically known items, such as 
current environmental factors and credit trends. In addition, representatives from each of the Risk Management and Finance staffs that cover business areas that have delinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their 

recommended reserve balances based upon leading credit indicators, 
including loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as well as 
economic trends including housing prices, unemployment and GDP. This 

methodology is applied separately for each individual product within each 
different geographic region in which these portfolios exist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, the size and 
diversity of individual large credits, and the ability of borrowers with foreign 
currency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary for orderly 
debt servicing, among other things, are all taken into account during this 
review. Changes in these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit 

costs in any period and could result in a change in the allowance. Changes 
to the Allowance for loan losses flow through the Consolidated Statement of 
Income on the line Provision for loan losses.Allowance for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsA similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating 
a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments 
and standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified on the balance 
sheet in Other liabilities. Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending 
commitments flow through the Consolidated Statement of Income on the 
line Provision for unfunded lending commitments.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when 
purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through 
purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. Servicing rights in the U.S. mortgage classes of servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in 
current earnings. Additional information on the Company™s MSRs can be found in Note 22 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 165Consumer Mortgage Representations and WarrantiesThe majority of Citi™s exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to its U.S. Consumer mortgage business.When selling a loan, Citi (through its CitiMortgage business) makes various representations and warranties relating to, among other things, 
the following:Citi™s ownership of the loan;the validity of the lien securing the loan;the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan;the effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing the loan;the process used in selecting the loans for inclusion in a transaction;the loan™s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the buyer; and 
the loan™s compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws.The specific representations and warranties made by Citi depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer. 
Market conditions and credit rating agency requirements may also affect 
representations and warranties and the other provisions to which Citi may 
agree in loan sales. Repurchases or ﬁMake-Wholeﬂ PaymentsIn the event of a breach of these representations and warranties, Citi 
may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans (generally 
at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest) with the identified 
defects or indemnify (ﬁmake-wholeﬂ) the investors for their losses. Citi™s 
representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in 
amount or time of coverage. However, contractual liability arises only when 
the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a 
loss results from the breach.In the case of a repurchase, Citi will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loan and the loan is typically considered a credit-impaired 
loan and accounted for under SOP 03-3, ﬁAccounting for Certain Loans and 
Debt Securities Acquired in a Transferﬂ (now incorporated into ASC 310-30, 

ReceivablesŠLoans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated 
Credit Quality) (SOP 03-3). These repurchases have not had a material 
impact on Citi™s non-performing loan statistics because credit-impaired 

purchased SOP 03-3 loans are not included in non-accrual loans, since they 
generally continue to accrue interest until write-off.Citi™s repurchases have primarily been from the U.S. government 
sponsored entities (GSEs). Citi has recorded a reserve for its exposure to losses from the obligation to repurchase previously sold loans (referred to as the repurchase reserve) 
that is included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In 
estimating the repurchase reserve, Citi considers reimbursements estimated 
to be received from third-party correspondent lenders and indemnification 
agreements relating to previous acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights. Citi 

aggressively pursues collection from any correspondent lender that it believes has the financial ability to pay. The estimated reimbursements are based on 

Citi™s analysis of its most recent collection trends and the financial solvency 

of the correspondents. In the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired SOP 03-3 loan, the difference between the loan™s fair value and the repurchase amount is 

recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve. Make-whole payments to 
the investor are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the 
reserve. The repurchase reserve is estimated when Citi sells loans (recorded as 
an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income) and is updated quarterly. Any change in 

estimate is recorded in Other revenue. The repurchase reserve is calculated by individual sales vintage (i.e., the year the loans were sold) and is based on various assumptions. While 
substantially all of Citi™s current loan sales are with GSEs, with which Citi 

has considerable historical experience, these assumptions contain a level 
of uncertainty and risk that, if different from actual results, could have a 
material impact on the reserve amounts.  The most significant assumptions 
used to calculate the reserve levels are as follows:Loan documentation requests;Repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests;Claims appeal success rate;Estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole.The repurchase reserve estimation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The assumptions used to calculate the repurchase 
reserve contain a level of uncertainty and risk that, if different from actual 
results, could have a material impact on the reserve amounts.  Securities and Banking-Sponsored Private Label Residential Mortgage SecuritizationsŠRepresentations 
and WarrantiesMortgage securitizations sponsored by Citi™s S&B business represent a much 
smaller portion of Citi™s mortgage business. The mortgages included in these securitizations were purchased from parties outside of S&B. Representations and warranties (representations) 
relating to the mortgage loans included in each trust issuing the securities 
were made either by (1) Citi, or (2) in a relatively small number of cases, 
third-party sellers (Selling Entities, which were also often the originators 
of the loans). These representations were generally made or assigned to the 
issuing trust.The representations in these securitization transactions generally related to, among other things, the following:the absence of fraud on the part of the mortgage loan borrower, the seller or any appraiser, broker or other party involved in the origination of the 
mortgage loan (which was sometimes wholly or partially limited to the 
knowledge of the representation provider);whether the mortgage property was occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence;166the mortgage loan™s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;whether the mortgage loan was originated in conformity with the originator™s underwriting guidelines; and
the detailed data concerning the mortgage loans that was included on the mortgage loan schedule.In the event of a breach of its representations, Citi may be required either to repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects (generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest) or indemnify the investors 
for their losses.S&B has received only a small number of claims based on breaches of representations relating to the mortgage loans in these 
securitization transactions.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of 
net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, whereby Goodwill is allocated to the Company™s reporting 
units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a 
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Furthermore, on any business 
dispositions, Goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the 
ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the 
reporting unit. Intangible AssetsIntangible assetsŠincluding core deposit intangibles, present value 
of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer 
relationships, and other intangible assets, but excluding MSRsŠare 
amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset management contracts 
and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment 
tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived 
intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other Intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not 
recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the Intangible asset. Other Assets and Other LiabilitiesOther assets include, among other items, loans held-for-sale, deferred tax 
assets, equity-method investments, interest and fees receivable, premises and 
equipment, end-user derivatives in a net receivable position, repossessed 
assets, and other receivables. Other liabilities includes, among other items, accrued expenses and other payables, deferred tax liabilities, end-user derivatives in a net payable 
position, and reserves for legal claims, taxes, restructuring reserves, unfunded 
lending commitments, and other matters. Repossessed AssetsUpon repossession, loans are adjusted, if necessary, to the estimated fair value 
of the underlying collateral and transferred to repossessed assets. This is 
reported in Other assets, net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net 
declines in value as appropriate. SecuritizationsThe Company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages. 
Other types of securitized assets include corporate debt instruments (in cash 
and synthetic form) and student loans. There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. In cases where the Company originated or owned the 
financial assets transferred to the securitization entity, it determines whether 

that transfer is considered a sale under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP). If it is a sale, the transferred assets are removed from 
the Company™s Consolidated Balance Sheet with a gain or loss recognized. 

Alternatively, if the Company determines that the transfer is a financing 

rather than a sale, the assets remain on the Company™s Consolidated 

Balance Sheet with an offsetting liability recognized in the amount of 
proceeds received. In addition, the Company determines whether the securitization entity would be included in its Consolidated Financial Statements. If the 
securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the 
primary beneficiary.
For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, a consolidation decision is based on who has voting 
control of the entity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights 

in certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities controlled by 
Citigroup are consolidated. Effective January 1, 2010, upon adoption of SFAS 166/167, Citi first 
makes a determination as to whether the securitization entity would be 
consolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of financial assets 
is considered a sale under GAAP. Furthermore, former qualifying special 

purpose entities (QSPEs) are now considered VIEs and are no longer exempt 
from consolidation. The Company consolidates VIEs when it has both:  (1) power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the 
entity™s economic performance and (2) an obligation to absorb losses or 

right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant 
to the VIE. Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be retained in the form of subordinated interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts, 
and servicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a 
seller™s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which 

is not in securitized form. Prior to January 1, 2010, when the securitization 
trusts were not consolidated, the seller™s interest was carried on a historical 

cost basis and classified as Consumer loans. Retained interests in securitized 
mortgage loans and student loans were classified as Trading account 
assets, as were a majority of the retained interests in securitized credit 
card receivables. DebtShort-term borrowings and long-term debt are generally accounted for at 
amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to report certain 
structured notes at fair value.167Transfers of Financial AssetsFor a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale: the assets must have been isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; 
the purchaser must have the right to sell the assets transferred or, if the 
purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization 
and asset-backed financing activities and that entity is constrained from 
pledging the assets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have the 
right to sell the beneficial interests (prior to January 1 2010, the entity had 
to be a QSPE); and the Company may not have an option or any obligation 
to reacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are 
removed from the Company™s Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions 
for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the 
assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the sale proceeds are 
recognized as the Company™s liability. A legal opinion on a sale is generally 
obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing 
involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. For a 
transfer to be eligible for sale accounting, those opinions must state that 
the asset transfer is considered a sale and that the assets transferred would 
not be consolidated with the Company™s other assets in the event of the 
Company™s insolvency. For a transfer of a portion of a financial asset to be considered a sale, the portion transferred must meet the definition of a participating interest. 
A participating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an entire 
financial asset; all cash flows must be divided proportionally, with the same 

priority of payment; no participating interest in the transferred asset may 
be subordinated to the interest of another participating interest holder; and 
no party may have the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset 
unless all participating interest holders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is 
accounted for as a secured borrowing.See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Risk Management ActivitiesŠDerivatives Used for 
Hedging PurposesThe Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its 
trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly 
or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest-
rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased-option positions, as well as 
foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair 
value in Other assets, Other liabilities, Trading account assets and Trading 
account liabilities. To qualify as a hedge under the hedge accounting rules, a derivative 
must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. 
The hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing 
the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, which 
includes the item and risk that is being hedged and the derivative that is 
being used, as well as how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness 
measured. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on 
a retrospective and prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures 
of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current 
earnings. If a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer 
qualifies as a hedge and hedge accounting would not be applied. Any gains 
or losses attributable to the derivatives, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions with no offset on the hedged item, similar to trading derivatives. The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits 
and controls. The underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be 
an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in Other revenue or Principal transactions, together with changes in the fair 
value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk. These are expected to, 
and generally do, offset each other. Any net amount, representing hedge 

ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroup™s fair value 

hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt and available-for-

sale securities. For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating- and fixed-rate assets, liabilities or forecasted 
transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of 
the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the 

variability of the hedged cash flows, the effective portion of the changes 
in the derivatives™ fair values will not be included in current earnings, but 
is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when 
the hedged cash flows impact earnings. To the extent these derivatives are 

not effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included in Other revenue. Citigroup™s cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floating-

rate debt, as well as rollovers of short-term fixed-rate liabilities and floating-
rate liabilities and forecasted debt issuances. For net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting 
treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective 

portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward 
premium or discount, is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges, rather than qualifying for hedge accounting, are also carried at fair value, with changes in value 
included in Principal transactions or Other revenue. Citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too 
complex or operationally burdensome; examples are hedges of the credit 
risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup 
periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate 
either a qualifying hedge or an economic hedge, after considering the 
relative cost and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the 
hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings, such as 
hedges of commitments to originate one-to-four-family mortgage loans to be 

held-for-sale and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). 
For those hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed, the hedge accounting treatment described in the 
paragraphs above is no longer applied. Instead, the end-user derivative is 
terminated or transferred to the trading account. For fair value hedges, any 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the 
asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. For 
cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain 168in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction 

will not likely occur, any amounts that remain in 
Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) are immediately reflected in Other revenue. Employee Benefits ExpenseEmployee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and 
other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis, 
contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the 
amortization of restricted stock awards and costs of other employee benefits. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock and 
option awards over the requisite service period based on the instruments™ 
grant date fair value, reduced by expected forfeitures. Compensation cost 
related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age plus years-
of-service requirements (retirement eligible employees) is accrued in the 
year prior to the grant date, in the same manner as the accrual for cash 
incentive compensation.Income TaxesThe Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and 
municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company 
operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations 
by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make 
judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently 
complex tax laws. The Company must also make estimates about when 
in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax 
jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be 
settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of Income tax expense. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that have been recognized for financial statements or tax returns, based upon 
enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to 
management™s judgment that realization is more likely than not. FASB 

Interpretation No. 48, ﬁAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
ﬂ (FIN 48) (now ASC 740, Income Taxes), sets out a consistent framework to 

determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain 
tax positions. This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax 
benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. 
The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit 
that is greater than 50% likely to be realized. FIN 48 also sets out disclosure 
requirements to enhance transparency of an entity™s tax reserves.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the Company™s provision and related income tax assets 

and liabilities.Commissions, Underwriting and Principal TransactionsCommissions, underwriting and principal transactions revenues and related 
expenses are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. Earnings per ShareEarnings per share (EPS) is computed after deducting preferred stock 
dividends. The Company has granted restricted and deferred share awards 
that are considered to be participating securities, which constitute a second 
class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of Citigroup™s earnings is 
allocated to the second class of common stock in the EPS calculation. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders after the allocation of dividends and undistributed 
earnings to the second class of common stock by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per 
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other 
contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is computed after giving 
consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company™s stock 

options and warrants, convertible securities, T-DECs, and the shares that 

could have been issued under the Company™s Management Committee Long-

Term Incentive Plan and after the allocation of earnings to the second class 

of common stock. Use of EstimatesManagement must make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. Such 
estimates are used in connection with certain fair value measurements. See 
Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions on 
estimates used in the determination of fair value. The Company also uses 
estimates in determining consolidation decisions for special-purpose entities 
as discussed in Note 22. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining 
the amounts of other-than-temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill 
and other intangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may arise 
from credit-related exposures and probable and estimable losses related to 
litigation and regulatory proceedings, and tax reserves. While management 
makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those 
estimates. Current market conditions increase the risk and complexity of the 
judgments in these estimates. Cash FlowsCash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due 
from banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in 
the same category as the related assets and liabilities. The Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows line item Capital expenditures on premises and 
equipment and capitalized software includes capitalized software costs of 
$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for December 31, 2010, 2009 and 
2008, respectively. These balances were previously included in the line item 
Other, net.Related Party TransactionsThe Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries 
and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, 
include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin 
accounts, derivative trading, charges for operational support and the 
borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the ordinary course 
of business. 169ACCOUNTING CHANGES Change in Accounting for Embedded Credit Derivatives In March 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-11, Scope Exception Related to 
Embedded Credit Derivatives. The ASU clarifies that certain embedded 

derivatives, such as those contained in certain securitizations, CDOs and 

structured notes, should be considered embedded credit derivatives subject to 

potential bifurcation and separate fair value accounting. The ASU allows any 

beneficial interest issued by a securitization vehicle to be accounted for under 

the fair value option at transition on July 1, 2010. 
The Company has elected to account for certain beneficial interests issued by securitization vehicles under the fair value option that are included in 
the table below. Beneficial interests previously classified as held-to-maturity 

(HTM) were reclassified to available-for-sale (AFS) on June 30, 2010, because 

as of that reporting date, the Company did not have the intent to hold the 
beneficial interests until maturity.
The following table also shows the gross gains and gross losses that 
make up the pretax cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for 

reclassified beneficial interests, recorded on July 1, 2010:July 1, 2010

$12,062$420$359$12,001


Beginning July 1, 2010, the Company elected to account for these beneficial interests under the fair value option for various reasons, including:To reduce the operational burden of assessing beneficial interests for bifurcation under the guidance in the ASU;Where bifurcation would otherwise be required under the ASU, to avoid the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately. 
The Company reclassified substantially all beneficial interests where 
bifurcation would otherwise be required under the ASU; and To permit more economic hedging strategies without generating volatility in reported earnings.Additional Disclosures Regarding Fair Value MeasurementsIn January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures 
about Fair Value Measurements. The ASU requires disclosure of the 
amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for the transfers. The disclosures are effective for 
reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2009. The Company adopted 
ASU 2010-06 as of January 1, 2010. The required disclosures are included in 
Note 25. Additionally, disclosures of the gross purchases, sales, issuances and 
settlements activity in Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy will be 
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. Elimination of Qualifying Special Purpose Entities 
(QSPEs) and Changes in the Consolidation Model for VIEsIn June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166, now incorporated into ASC Topic 860) and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167, now incorporated into ASC 
Topic 810). Citigroup adopted both standards on January 1, 2010. Citigroup 
has elected to apply SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 prospectively. Accordingly, prior 
periods have not been restated.SFAS 166 eliminates the concept of QSPEs from U.S. GAAP and amends 
the guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets. SFAS 167 

details three key changes to the consolidation model. First, former QSPEs 170are now included in the scope of SFAS 167. Second, the FASB has changed 
the method of analyzing which party to a VIE should consolidate the VIE 
(known as the primary beneficiary) to a qualitative determination of which 
party to the VIE has ﬁpower,ﬂ combined with potentially significant benefits 

or losses, instead of the previous quantitative risks and rewards model. The 
party that has ﬁpowerﬂ has the ability to direct the activities of the VIE that 
most significantly impact the VIE™s economic performance. Third, the new 

standard requires that the primary beneficiary analysis be re-evaluated 
whenever circumstances change. The previous rules required reconsideration 
of the primary beneficiary only when specified reconsideration 
events occurred. As a result of implementing these new accounting standards, Citigroup consolidated certain of the VIEs and former QSPEs with which it currently 
has involvement. Further, certain asset transfers, including transfers of 

portions of assets, that would have been considered sales under SFAS 140, are 

considered secured borrowings under the new standards. In accordance with SFAS 167, Citigroup employed three approaches for 
newly consolidating certain VIEs and former QSPEs as of January 1, 2010. 
The first approach requires initially measuring the assets, liabilities, and 
noncontrolling interests of the VIEs and former QSPEs at their carrying 
values (the amounts at which the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling 
interests would have been carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements, if 

Citigroup had always consolidated these VIEs and former QSPEs). The second 
approach measures assets at their unpaid principal amount, and is applied 
when determining carrying values is not practicable. The third approach is to 
elect the fair value option, in which all of the financial assets and liabilities 
of certain designated VIEs and former QSPEs are recorded at fair value upon 
adoption of SFAS 167 and continue to be marked to market thereafter, with 

changes in fair value reported in earnings. Citigroup consolidated all required VIEs and former QSPEs, as of January 1, 2010, at carrying values or unpaid principal amounts, except for 
certain private label residential mortgage and mutual fund deferred sales 
commissions VIEs, for which the fair value option was elected. The following 
tables present the impact of adopting these new accounting standards 
applying these approaches. The incremental impact of these changes on GAAP assets and resulting risk-
weighted assets for those VIEs and former QSPEs that were consolidated or 
deconsolidated for accounting purposes as of January 1, 2010 was as follows: IncrementalIn billions of dollarsGAAP assetsRisk- weighted assets (1)Impact of consolidation$86.3$0.8

$712.0 billion), and (ii) the assets of significant VIEs as of January 1, 2010 
with which Citigroup is involved (totaling approximately $219.2 billion) that 
were previously unconsolidated and are required to be consolidated under the 
new accounting standards. Due to the variety of transaction structures and 
the level of Citigroup involvement in individual former QSPEs and VIEs, only 
a portion of the former QSPEs and VIEs with which the Company is involved 
were required to be consolidated.In addition, the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of January 1, 2010 resulted in an aggregate after-tax charge 

to Retained earnings of $8.4 billion, reflecting the net effect of an 
overall pretax charge to Retained earnings (primarily relating to the 
establishment of loan loss reserves and the reversal of residual interests held) 
of $13.4 billion and the recognition of related deferred tax assets amounting 
to $5.0 billion. The impact on certain of Citigroup™s regulatory capital ratios of adopting 
these new accounting standards, reflecting immediate implementation of 
the recently issued final risk-based capital rules regarding SFAS 166/167, was

ASU 2010-10 provides a deferral to the requirements of SFAS 167 where the following criteria are met:The entity being evaluated for consolidation is an investment company, as defined in ASC 946-10, Financial ServicesŠInvestment Companies, 
or an entity for which it is acceptable based on industry practice to apply 
measurement principles that are consistent with an investment company;The reporting enterprise does not have an explicit or implicit obligation to fund losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity; andThe entity being evaluated for consolidation is not:a securitization entity; Œan asset-backed financing entity; or Œan entity that was formerly considered a qualifying  Œspecial-purpose entity.The Company has determined that a majority of the investment vehicles managed by Citigroup are provided a deferral from the requirements of 
SFAS 167, because they meet these criteria. These vehicles continue to be 
evaluated under the requirements of FIN 46(R) (ASC 810-10), prior to the 
implementation of SFAS 167.Where the Company has determined that certain investment vehicles are subject to the consolidation requirements of SFAS 167, the consolidation 

conclusions reached upon initial application of SFAS 167 are consistent 

with the consolidation conclusions reached under the requirements of 
ASC 810-10, prior to the implementation of SFAS 167. 
172Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per ShareAs of December 31, 2009, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 

(ASU) No. 2009-12, 
Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset 
Value per Share (or its Equivalent), which provides guidance on measuring 
the fair value of certain alternative investments. The ASU permits entities to 
use net asset value as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of their 
investments in certain investment funds. The ASU also requires additional 
disclosures regarding the nature and risks of such investments and provides 
guidance on the classification of such investments as Level 2 or Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy. This ASU did not have a material impact on the 
Company™s accounting for its investments in alternative investment funds.Multiple Foreign Exchange Rates In May 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-19, Foreign Currency Issues: 
Multiple Foreign Currency Exchange Rates. The ASU requires certain 
disclosure in situations when an entity™s reported balances in U.S. dollar 
monetary assets held by its foreign entities differ from the actual U.S. 
dollar-denominated balances due to different foreign exchange rates used in 
remeasurement and translation. The ASU also clarifies the reporting for the 
difference between the reported balances and the U.S. dollar-denominated 
balances upon the initial adoption of highly inflationary accounting. The 
ASU does not have a material impact on the Company™s accounting.  Effect of a Loan Modification When the Loan Is Part of a 
Pool Accounted for as a Single Asset (ASU No. 2010-18)In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-18, Effect of a Loan Modification When the Loan is Part of a Pool Accounted for as a Single 
Asset. As a result of the amendments in this ASU, modifications of loans 
that are accounted for within a pool do not result in the removal of those 
loans from the pool, even if the modification of those loans would otherwise 
be considered a troubled debt restructuring. An entity will continue to be 
required to consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included 
is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change. The ASU was effective 
for reporting periods ending on or after July 15, 2010. The ASU had no 
material effect on the Company™s financial statements.FASB Launches Accounting Standards CodificationThe FASB issued FASB Statement No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards CodificationŽ and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (now ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). 
The statement establishes the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationŽ 
(Codification or ASC) as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied 
by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws 
are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All 
other nongrandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the 
Codification has become nonauthoritative.Following the Codification, the Board will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force 

Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates (ASU), which 
will serve to update the Codification, provide background information 
about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to 
the Codification.GAAP is not intended to be changed as a result of the FASB™s Codification 
project, but what does change is the way the guidance is organized and 
presented. As a result, these changes have a significant impact on how 
companies reference GAAP in their financial statements and in their 
accounting policies for financial statements issued for interim and annual 
periods ending after September 15, 2009. Citigroup is providing references to the Codification topics alongside references to the predecessor standards.Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial 
InstrumentsIn April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, (now ASC 825-10-50-10, Financial Instruments: Fair Value of Financial Instruments). This FSP requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information 
about the fair value of financial instruments on a quarterly basis, including 
methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value during the 
period. These disclosures were previously only provided annually. The disclosures required by this FSP were effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. This FSP has no effect on how Citigroup accounts for 
these instruments.Measurement of Fair Value in Inactive MarketsIn April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have 
Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not 
Orderly (now ASC 820-10-35-51A, Fair Value Measurements and 
Disclosures: Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of 
Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased). The FSP reaffirms that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. 
The FSP also reaffirms the need to use judgment in determining whether a 
formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values 
when the market has become inactive. The adoption of the FSP had no effect 
on the Company™s Consolidated Financial Statements.173Measuring Liabilities at Fair ValueAs of September 30, 2009, the Company adopted ASU No. 2009-05, Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value. This ASU provides clarification that in 
circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical 
liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value 
using one or more of the following techniques:a valuation technique that uses quoted prices for similar liabilities (or an identical liability) when traded as assets; oranother valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of ASC 820. This ASU also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no 
adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair 
value measurements. This ASU did not have a material impact on the Company™s fair 
value measurements.Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on 
Investment SecuritiesIn April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115-2) (now ASC 320-10-35-34, InvestmentsŠDebt and Equity Securities: 
Recognition of an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment), which amends the recognition guidance for other-than-temporary impairments (OTTI) 
of debt securities and expands the financial statement disclosures for OTTI 
on debt and equity securities. Citigroup adopted the FSP in the first quarter 
of 2009. As a result of the FSP, the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income 
reflects the full impairment (that is, the difference between the security™s 

amortized cost basis and fair value) on debt securities that the Company 
intends to sell or would more-likely-than-not be required to sell before the 
expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. For available-for-sale (AFS) and 

held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities that management has no intent to 
sell and believes that it more-likely-than-not will not be required to sell prior 
to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized 

in earnings, while the rest of the fair value loss is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The credit loss component recognized 
in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected 
to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected using the 
Company™s cash flow projections and its base assumptions. As a result of 

the adoption of the FSP, Citigroup™s income in the first quarter of 2009 was 

higher by $631 million on a pretax basis ($391 million on an after-tax basis) 

and AOCI was decreased by a corresponding amount. The cumulative effect of the change included an increase in the opening balance of Retained earnings at January 1, 2009 of $665 million on a 
pretax basis ($413 million after-tax). See Note 15 to the Consolidated 

Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Company™s investment 

securities and OTTI.Business CombinationsIn December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised), Business Combinations (now ASC 805-10, Business Combinations), which is 
designed to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and 
comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in 
its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. The 
statement retains the fundamental principle that the acquisition method 
of accounting (which was called the purchase method) be used for all 
business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business 
combination. The statement also retains the guidance for identifying 
and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. The most 
significant changes are: (1) acquisition costs and restructuring costs will 
now be expensed; (2) stock consideration will be measured based on the 
quoted market price as of the acquisition date instead of the date the deal is 
announced; (3) contingent consideration arrangements will be measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings each period for non-equity classified contingent consideration; and (4) the acquirer will 
record a 100% step-up to fair value for all assets and liabilities, including the 
minority interest portion, and goodwill is recorded as if a 100% interest was 
acquired. Citigroup adopted the standard on January 1, 2009, and it is applied prospectively. 
Noncontrolling Interests in SubsidiariesIn December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (now ASC 810-10-45-15, ConsolidationŠNoncontrolling Interests in a Subsidiary), which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling 
interests in subsidiaries (previously called minority interests) in consolidated 
financial statements and for the loss of control of subsidiaries. The Standard 
requires that the equity interest of noncontrolling shareholders, partners, 
or other equity holders in subsidiaries be presented as a separate item in 
Citigroup™s stockholders™ equity, rather than as a liability. After the initial 
adoption, when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling 
equity investment in the former subsidiary must be measured at fair value at 
the date of deconsolidation. 174The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of the remaining investment, rather than the previous carrying amount of that retained investment. Citigroup adopted the Standard on January 1, 2009. As a result, $2.392 billion of noncontrolling interests was reclassified from Other liabilities to Citigroup™s stockholders™ equity
.Sale with Repurchase Financing AgreementsIn February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 140-3, 
Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase Financing 
Transactions (now ASC 860-10-40-42, Transfers and Servicing: 
Repurchase Financing). This FSP provides implementation guidance on 
whether a security transfer with a contemporaneous repurchase financing 
involving the transferred financial asset must be evaluated as one linked 
transaction or two separate de-linked transactions. The FSP requires the recognition of the transfer and the repurchase agreement as one linked transaction, unless all of the following criteria 
are met: (1) the initial transfer and the repurchase financing are not 
contractually contingent on one another; (2) the initial transferor has full 
recourse upon default, and the repurchase agreement™s price is fixed and not 

at fair value; (3) the financial asset is readily obtainable in the marketplace 
and the transfer and repurchase financing are executed at market rates; and 
(4) the maturity of the repurchase financing is before the maturity of the 
financial asset. The scope of this FSP is limited to transfers and subsequent 
repurchase financings that are entered into contemporaneously or in 
contemplation of one another. 
Citigroup adopted the FSP on January 1, 2009. The impact of adopting this FSP was not material. Enhanced Disclosures of Credit Derivative 
Instruments and GuaranteesIn September 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, 
ﬁDisclosures About Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An 
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45, 
and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161ﬂ (now 
ASC 815-10-50-4K, Derivatives and Hedging: Credit Derivatives) which requires additional disclosures for sellers of credit derivative instruments 
and certain guarantees. This FSP requires the disclosure of the maximum 
potential amount of future payments, the related fair value, and the current 
status of the payment/performance risk for certain guarantees and credit 
derivatives sold. Measurement of Impairment for Certain SecuritiesIn January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, ﬁAmendments to 
the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue 99-20ﬂ (now incorporated into 
ASC 320-10-35-20, InvestmentsŠDebt and Equity Securities: Steps for 
Identifying and Accounting for Impairment), to achieve more consistent 
determination of whether other-than-temporary impairments of available-
for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities have occurred. Prior guidance required entities to assess whether it was probable that the holder would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the 
contractual terms. The FSP eliminates the requirement to consider market 
participants™ views of cash flows of a security in determining whether or not 
impairment has occurred. The FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively. The impact of adopting this 

FSP was not material. SEC Staff Guidance on Loan Commitments 
Recorded at Fair Value Through EarningsOn January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 
(SAB 109), which requires that the fair value of a written loan commitment 
that is marked to market through earnings should include the future 
cash flows related to the loan™s servicing rights. However, the fair value 
measurement of a written loan commitment still must exclude the expected 
net cash flows related to internally developed intangible assets (such as 
customer relationship intangible assets). SAB 109 applies to two types of 
loan commitments: (1) written mortgage loan commitments for loans that 
will be held-for-sale when funded and are marked to market as derivatives; 
and (2) other written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair 
value through earnings under the fair value option. SAB 109 supersedes 
SAB 105, which applied only to derivative loan commitments and allowed the 
expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan to 
be recognized only after the servicing asset had been contractually separated 
from the underlying loan by sale or securitization of the loan with servicing 
retained. SAB 109 was applied prospectively to loan commitments issued or 
modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. The impact of 
adopting this SAB was not material. 175Revisions to the Earnings-per-Share CalculationIn June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, ﬁDetermining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating 
Securitiesﬂ (now incorporated into ASC 260-10-45-59A, Earnings Per Share: Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method). Under the FSP, unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and included 

in the EPS calculation using the ﬁtwo-class method.ﬂ Citigroup™s restricted 
and deferred share awards meet the definition of a participating security. In 
accordance with the FSP, restricted and deferred shares are now included as a 
separate class of common stock in the basic and diluted EPS calculation. The following table shows the effect of adopting the FSP on Citigroup™s 
basic and diluted EPS:2010Basic earnings per share N/A
$0.36Diluted earnings per share (1)N/A
0.35


Fair Value Disclosures About Pension Plan AssetsIn December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, Employers™ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (now incorporated into ASC 715-20-50, Compensation and BenefitsŠ
Disclosure). This FSP requires that more detailed information about plan 
assets be disclosed on an annual basis. Citigroup is required to separate plan 
assets into the three fair value hierarchy levels and provide a roll-forward of 
the changes in fair value of plan assets classified as Level 3. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, but have no effect on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Income. Additional Disclosures for Derivative InstrumentsIn March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment to SFAS 133 (now incorporated into ASC 815-10-50, Derivatives and HedgingŠ
Disclosure). The Standard requires enhanced disclosures about derivative 
instruments and hedged items that are accounted for under ASC 815 related 
interpretations. The Standard is effective for all of the Company™s interim 
and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2009. 
The Standard expands the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedged 
items and has no impact on how Citigroup accounts for these instruments. Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded 
Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity™s Own StockDerivative contracts on a company™s own stock may be accounted for as 
equity instruments, rather than as assets and liabilities, only if they are both 
indexed solely to the company™s stock and settleable in shares. In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on 
Issue 07-5, ﬁDetermining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) 
Is Indexed to an Entity™s Own Stockﬂ (Issue 07-5) (now ASC 815-40-

15-5, Derivatives and Hedging: Evaluating Whether an Instrument 
is Considered Indexed to an Entity™s Own Stock
). An instrument (or 
embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to an entity™s own stock 

if its settlement amount is affected by variables other than those used to 
determine the fair value of a ﬁplain vanillaﬂ option or forward contract on 
equity shares, or if the instrument contains a feature (such as a leverage 
factor) that increases exposure to those variables. An equity-linked financial 
instrument (or embedded feature) would not be considered indexed to the 
entity™s own stock if the strike price is denominated in a currency other than 

the issuer™s functional currency. 
This issue was effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009 and did not have a material impact. Equity Method Investment Accounting ConsiderationsIn November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on 
Issue 08-6, ﬁEquity Method Investment Accounting Considerationsﬂ (Issue 
08-6) (now ASC 323-10, 
InvestmentsŠEquity Method and Joint Ventures
). An entity shall measure its equity method investment initially at cost. Any 
other-than-temporary impairment of an equity method investment should 
be recognized in accordance with Opinion 18. An equity method investor 
shall not separately test an investee™s underlying assets for impairment. 
Share issuance by an investee shall be accounted for as if the equity method 
investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment, with a gain or loss 
recognized in earnings. This issue was effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and did not have a material impact. 176Accounting for Defensive Intangible AssetsIn November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue 08-7, ﬁAccounting for Defensive Intangible Assetsﬂ (Issue 08-7) (now 
ASC 350-30-25-5, IntangiblesŠGoodwill and Other: Defensive Intangible 
Assets). An acquired defensive asset shall be accounted for as a separate unit 
of accounting (i.e., an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer). 
The useful life assigned to an acquired defensive asset shall be based on the 
period during which the asset would diminish in value. Issue 08-7 states that 
it would be rare for a defensive intangible asset to have an indefinite life. 
Issue 08-7 was effective for Citigroup on January 1, 2009, and did not have a 
material impact. CVA Accounting MisstatementIn January 2010, the Company determined that an error existed in the process 

used to value certain liabilities for which the Company elected the fair value 

option (FVO). The error related to a calculation intended to measure the impact 

on the liability™s fair value attributable to Citigroup™s credit spreads. Because 

of the error in the process, both an initial Citi contractual credit spread and 

an initial own-credit valuation adjustment were being included at the time 

of issuance of new Citi FVO debt. The own-credit valuation adjustment was 

properly included; therefore, the initial Citi contractual credit spread should 

have been excluded. (See Note 26 for a description of own-credit valuation 

adjustments.) The cumulative effect of this error from January 1, 2007 (the 

date that SFAS 157 (ASC 820), requiring the valuation of own-credit for FVO 

liabilities, was adopted) through December 31, 2008 was to overstate income 

and retained earnings by $204
 million ($330
 million on a pretax basis). The 
impact of this adjustment was determined not to be material to the Company™s 

results of operations and financial position for any previously reported period. 

Consequently, in the accompanying financial statements, the cumulative effect 

through December 31, 2008 was recorded in 2009. 
The table below summarizes the previously reported impact of CVA income 
for debt on which the FVO was elected and the related adjustments to correct 
the process error for the impacted reporting periods.In millions of dollars2008

177FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDSLoss-Contingency DisclosuresIn July 2010, the FASB issued a second exposure draft proposing expanded disclosures regarding loss contingencies. This proposal increases the 
number of loss contingencies subject to disclosure and requires substantial 
quantitative and qualitative information to be provided about those 
loss contingencies. The proposal will have no impact on the Company™s 
accounting for loss contingencies. Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses 
DisclosuresIn July 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-20, Disclosures about Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses. 
The ASU requires a greater level of disaggregated information about the 
allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of financing receivables. The 
period-end balance disclosure requirements for loans and the allowance for 
loans losses are effective for reporting periods ending on or after December 
15, 2010 and are included in this annual report (see Notes 16 and 17), while 
disclosures for activity during a reporting period in the loan and allowance 
for loan losses accounts will be effective for reporting periods beginning 
on or after December 15, 2010. The FASB has deferred the troubled debt 
restructuring (TDR) disclosure requirements that were part of this ASU. The 
disclosures on TDRs were supposed to be required for the first quarter of 2011. 

However, FASB has postponed the effective date to be concurrent with the 
effective date of the proposed guidance for identifying a TDR, expected to be 
in the second quarter of 2011. Potential Amendments to Current Accounting StandardsIn January 2011, the FASB issued the Proposed Accounting Standards 
UpdateŠBalance Sheet (Topic 210): Offsetting, to propose a framework 
for offsetting financial assets and liabilities. This proposal would prohibit 
netting most derivative contracts covered by ISDA master netting agreements 
and also prohibit netting most repurchase/resale agreements under standard 
industry agreements that are allowed to be netted today and would result in a 
significant gross-up of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The FASB 
and IASB are currently working on several joint projects, including amendments to existing accounting standards governing financial 
instruments and lease accounting. Upon completion of the standards, the 
Company will need to re-evaluate its accounting and disclosures. The FASB 

is proposing sweeping changes to the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments, hedging and impairment guidance. The FASB is also 
working on a project that would require all leases to be capitalized on the 
balance sheet. These projects will have significant impacts for the Company. 

However, due to ongoing deliberations of the standard-setters, the Company is 

currently unable to determine the effect of future amendments or proposals.Investment Company Audit Guide (SOP 07-1)In July 2007, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 07-1, ﬁClarification 
of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies 
and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for 
Investments in Investment Companiesﬂ (SOP 07-1) (now incorporated 
into ASC 946-10, Financial Services-Investment Companies), which was 
expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 
2007. However, in February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date 
indefinitely by issuing an FSP SOP 07-1-1, ﬁEffective Date of AICPA 
Statement of Position 07-1.ﬂ This statement sets forth more stringent criteria 
for qualifying as an investment company than does the predecessor Audit 
Guide. In addition, ASC 946-10 (SOP 07-1) establishes new criteria for a 
parent company or equity method investor to retain investment company 
accounting in their consolidated financial statements. Investment companies 
record all their investments at fair value with changes in value reflected 
in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of 
adopting the SOP.1782. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS DIVESTITURES The following divestitures occurred in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and do not qualify as Discontinued operations. Divestitures that qualified as 
Discontinued operations are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.Sale of PrimericaIn April 2010, Citi completed the IPO of Primerica and sold approximately 
34% to public investors. In the same month, Citi completed the sale of 
approximately 22% of Primerica to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm. 
Citi contributed 4% of the Primerica shares to Primerica for employee 
and agent stock-based awards immediately prior to the sales. Citi retains 
an approximate 40% interest in Primerica after the sales and records the 
investment under the equity method. Citi recorded an after-tax gain on sale of $26 million.Concurrent with the sale of the shares, Citi entered into co-insurance agreements with Primerica to reinsure up to 90% of the risk associated with 
the in-force insurance policies.Sale of Phibro LLCOn December 31, 2009, the Company sold 100% of its interest in Phibro 
LLC to Occidental Petroleum Corporation for a purchase price equal to 
approximately the net asset value of the business. The decision to sell Phibro was the outcome of an evaluation of a variety of alternatives and is consistent with Citi™s core strategy of a client-centered 

business model. The sale of Phibro does not affect Citi™s client-facing 

commodities business lines, which will continue to operate and serve the 
needs of Citi™s clients throughout the world.
Sale of Citi™s Nikko Asset Management Business 
and Trust and Banking CorporationOn October 1, 2009, the Company completed the sale of its entire stake in 
Nikko Asset Management (Nikko AM) to the Sumitomo Trust and Banking 
Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Trust) and completed the sale of Nikko Citi Trust and 
Banking Corporation to Nomura Trust & Banking Co. Ltd. The Nikko AM transaction was valued at 120 billion yen (U.S. $1.3 billion at an exchange rate of 89.60 yen to U.S. $1.00 as of September 30, 
2009). The Company received all-cash consideration of 75.6 billion yen 
(U.S. $844 million), after certain deal-related expenses and adjustments, 
for its 64% beneficial ownership interest in Nikko AM. Sumitomo Trust also 

acquired the beneficial ownership interests in Nikko AM held by various 
minority investors in Nikko AM, bringing Sumitomo Trust™s total ownership 

stake in Nikko AM to 98.55% at closing. For the sale of Nikko Citi Trust and Banking Corporation, the Company 
received all-cash consideration of 19 billion yen (U.S. $212 million at an 
exchange rate of 89.60 yen to U.S. $1.00 as of September 30, 2009) as part of 
the transaction, subject to certain post-closing purchase price adjustments.Retail Partner Cards SalesDuring 2009, Citigroup sold its Financial Institutions (FI) and Diners Club 
North America credit card businesses. Total credit card receivables disposed 
of in these transactions was approximately $2.2 billion. During 2010, Citigroup sold its Canadian MasterCard business and U.S. retail sales finance portfolios. Total credit card receivables disposed of in these transactions was 
approximately $3.6 billion. Each of these businesses is in Local Consumer 
Lending.Joint Venture with Morgan StanleyOn June 1, 2009, Citi and Morgan Stanley established a joint venture (JV) 
that combines the Global Wealth Management platform of Morgan Stanley 
with Citigroup™s Smith Barney, Quilter and Australia private client networks. 
Citi sold 100% of these businesses to Morgan Stanley in exchange for a 49% 
stake in the JV and an upfront cash payment of $2.75 billion. The Brokerage and Asset Management business recorded a pretax gain of approximately 
$11.1 billion ($6.7 billion after-tax) on this sale. Both Morgan Stanley and 
Citi will access the JV for retail distribution, and each firm™s institutional 
businesses will continue to execute order flow from the JV.Citigroup™s 49% ownership in the JV is recorded as an equity method 
investment. In determining the value of its 49% interest in the JV, Citigroup 

utilized the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm and

and 20% owned by public shareholders, and which was part of the Citi 
Holdings segment, entered into definitive agreements that resulted in 
the divestiture of Citi™s private student loan business and approximately 
$31 billion of its approximate $40 billion in assets to Discover Financial 
Services (Discover) and SLM Corporation (Sallie Mae). The transaction 
closed on December 31, 2010. As part of the transaction, Citi provided Sallie 
Mae with $1.1 billion of seller-financing.This sale was reported as discontinued operations for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 only. Prior periods were not reclassified due to the 

immateriality of the impact in those periods. The total 2010 impact from the 
sale of SLC resulted in an overall after-tax loss of $427
 million.Additionally, as part of the transactions, Citibank, N.A. purchased 
approximately $8.6 billion of assets from SLC prior to the sale of SLC. The following is a summary as of December 31, 2010 of the assets and liabilities for the operations related to the SLC business sold:In millions of dollars2010Assets

Combined Results for Discontinued OperationsThe following is summarized financial information for the SLC business, Nikko Cordial business, German retail banking operations and 
CitiCapital business. In addition to the businesses noted above, the following affected Discontinued operations. During 2010, certain tax reserves were released, 
in relation to the sale of Citigroup™s Life Insurance and Annuity business in 

2005, due to favorable resolutions with the IRS. This resulted in an after-

tax gain of $59 million in 2010. During 2009, contingent consideration 
payments of $29 million pretax ($19 million after tax) were received related 
to the sale of Citigroup™s Asset Management business, which was sold in 

December 2005. During 2008, in relation to the sale of its Life Insurance and 
Annuity business in 2005, the Company fulfilled its previously agreed upon 
obligations with regard to its remaining 10% economic interest in the long-
term care business that it had sold to the predecessor of Genworth Financial 
in 2000. The reimbursement resulted in a pretax loss of $50 million 
($33 million after tax) at December 31, 2008. The Asset Management and the 

Life Insurance and Annuity transactions are included in these balances. In millions of dollars2010Total revenues, net of interest

8. INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has adopted a number of equity compensation plans under 
which it currently administers award programs involving grants of stock 
options, restricted or deferred stock awards, and stock payments. The award 
programs are used to attract, retain and motivate officers, employees and 
non-employee directors, to provide incentives for their contributions to the 
long-term performance and growth of the Company, and to align their 
interests with those of stockholders. Certain of these equity issuances also 
increase the Company™s stockholders™ equity. The plans and award programs 
are administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the 
Citigroup Board of Directors (the Committee), which is composed entirely of 
independent non-employee directors. Since April 19, 2005, all equity awards 
have been pursuant to stockholder-approved plans.At December 31, 2010, approximately 806.22 million shares were authorized and available for grant under Citigroup™s 2009 Stock Incentive 

Plan. Citigroup™s general practice has been to deliver shares from treasury 

stock upon the exercise or vesting of equity awards. However, newly issued 

shares were issued as stock payments in April 2010 to settle common stock 
equivalent awards granted in January 2010. Newly issued shares were also 
issued as stock payments in January 2011. Citigroup will be reviewing its 
general practice in 2011 and might begin using newly issued shares more 
regularly in 2011 or 2012 as an alternative to treasury shares. There is no 
income statement difference between treasury stock issuances and newly 
issued share issuances.The following table shows components of compensation expense relating to the Company™s stock-based compensation programs as recorded during

185Stock Award ProgramsCitigroup issues (and has issued) shares of its common stock in the form of restricted stock awards, deferred stock awards, and stock payments pursuant 
to the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (and predecessor plans) to its officers, 
employees and non-employee directors. Citigroup™s primary stock award program is the Capital Accumulation 
Program (CAP). Generally, CAP awards of restricted or deferred stock 

constitute a percentage of annual incentive compensation and vest ratably 
over four-year periods, beginning on the first anniversary of the award date. 
Continuous employment within Citigroup is generally required to vest in CAP and other stock award programs. Typically, exceptions allow 

vesting for participants whose employment is terminated involuntarily 
during the vesting period for a reason other than ﬁgross misconduct,ﬂ who 
meet specified age and service requirements before leaving employment 
(retirement-eligible participants), or who die or become disabled during the 
vesting period. Post-employment vesting by retirement-eligible participants is 
generally conditioned upon their refraining from competing with Citigroup 
during the remaining vesting period.From 2003 to 2007, Citigroup granted annual stock awards under its Citigroup Ownership Program (COP) to a broad base of employees who were 
not eligible for CAP. The COP awards of restricted or deferred stock vest after 

three years, but otherwise have terms similar to CAP. 
Non-employee directors receive part of their compensation in the form of deferred stock awards that vest in two years, and may elect to receive part of 
their retainer in the form of a stock payment, which they may elect to defer.
From time to time, restricted or deferred stock awards and/or stock option 
grants are made to induce talented employees to join Citigroup or as special 

retention awards to key employees. Vesting periods vary, but are generally two 

to four years. Generally, recipients must remain employed through the vesting 

dates to vest in the awards, except in cases of death, disability, or involuntary 

termination other than for ﬁgross misconduct.ﬂ Unlike CAP, these awards do not 

usually provide for post-employment vesting by retirement-eligible participants. 
For all stock awards, during the applicable vesting period, the shares awarded are not issued to participants (in the case of a deferred stock award) 
or cannot be sold or transferred by the participants (in the case of a restricted 
stock award), until after the vesting conditions have been satisfied. Recipients 
of deferred stock awards do not have any stockholder rights until shares 
are delivered to them, but they generally are entitled to receive dividend-
equivalent payments during the vesting period. Recipients of restricted 
stock awards are entitled to a limited voting right and to receive dividend 
or dividend-equivalent payments during the vesting period. Once a stock 
award vests, the shares become freely transferable (but certain executives are 
required to hold the shares subject to a stock ownership commitment). CAP awards made in January 2011 to ﬁidentified staffﬂ in the European Union have several features that differ from the generally applicable CAP 
provisions described above. ﬁIdentified staffﬂ are those Citigroup employees 
whose compensation is subject to various banking regulations on sound 
incentive compensation policies in the European Union. These CAP 
awards vest in full after three years of service, are subject to a six-month 
sale restriction after vesting, and are subject to cancellation if there is a 
material downturn in Citigroup™s or the employee™s business unit™s financial 

performance or a material failure of risk management (the EU clawback). A portion of the immediately vested cash incentive compensation awarded in January 2011 to selected highly compensated employees was delivered in 
immediately-vested stock payments. In the European Union, this stock was 
subject to a six-month sale restriction.Annual incentive awards made in January 2011, January 2010, and December 2009 to certain executive officers and highly compensated 
employees were made in the form of long-term restricted stock (LTRS), with 

terms prescribed by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as 
amended (EESA). The senior executive officers and next 20 most highly 
compensated employees for 2010 (the 2010 Top 25), and the senior executive 

officers and the next 95 most highly compensated employees for 2009 (the 
2009 Top 100), were eligible for LTRS awards. LTRS awards vest in full after 

three years of service and there are no provisions for early vesting of LTRS in 

the event of retirement, involuntary termination of employment or change in 
control, but early vesting will occur upon death or disability.
Annual incentive awards made in January 2011 to executive officers have a performance-based vesting condition.  If Citigroup has pretax net 
losses during any of the years of the deferral period, the Personnel and 
Compensation Committee of Citigroup™s Board of Directors may exercise its 

discretion to eliminate or reduce the number of shares that vest for that year. 

This performance-based vesting condition applies to CAP and LTRS awards 

made in January 2011 to executive officers. All CAP and LTRS awards made in January 2011 provide for a clawback 
that applies in the case of employee misconduct or where the awards 
were based on earnings that were misstated or on materially inaccurate 
performance metric criteria. For EU participants who are ﬁidentified staff,ﬂ 
this clawback is in addition to the EU clawback described above.186In September 2010, salary stock was paid to the 2010 Top 25 (other than 
the CEO) in a manner consistent with the salary stock payments made in 2009 pursuant to rulings issued by the Special Master for TARP Executive 

Compensation (the Special Master). The salary stock paid for 2010, net of tax 
withholdings, is transferable over a 12-month period beginning in January 
2011. There are no provisions for early release of these transfer restrictions 
in the event of retirement, involuntary termination of employment, change 
in control, or any other reason. In 2009 and January 2010, the 2009 Top 

100 received salary stock payments that become transferrable in monthly 
installments over periods of either one year or three years beginning in 
January 2010.Incentive compensation in respect of 2009 performance for the 2009 Top 
100 was administered pursuant to structures approved by the Special Master. 

Pursuant to such structures, the affected employees did not participate in CAP 
and instead received equity compensation in the form of fully vested stock 
payments, LTRS and other restricted and deferred stock awards subject to 

vesting requirements and sale restrictions. The other restricted and deferred 
stock awards vest ratably over three years pursuant to terms similar to CAP 
awards, but vested shares are subject to sale restrictions until the later of the 
first anniversary of the regularly scheduled vesting date or January 20, 2013.Unearned compensation expense associated with CAP and other stock awards described above represents the market value of Citigroup common 
stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably 
over the vesting period, except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible 
employees and salary stock and other immediately vested awards. The charge 
to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated 
based on the dates the retirement rules are met. Stock awards to retirement-
eligible employees and salary stock and other immediately vested awards 
are recognized in the year prior to the grant in the same manner as cash 
incentive compensation is accrued. Certain stock awards with performance 
conditions or clawback provisions may be subject to variable accounting.In connection with its agreement to repay $20 billion of its TARP 
obligations to the U.S. Treasury Department in December 2009, Citigroup 

announced that $1.7 billion of incentive compensation that would have 
otherwise been awarded in cash to employees in respect of 2009 performance 
would instead be awarded as ﬁcommon stock equivalentﬂ (CSE) awards. CSE 
awards were denominated in U.S. dollars or in local currency and were settled 
by stock payments made in April 2010. The number of shares delivered to recipients was equal to their individual 
CSE award value divided by the fair market value of Citi common stock on the 

settlement date ($4.93), less shares withheld for taxes, as applicable. For CSEs 

awarded to certain employees whose compensation structure was approved by 

the Special Master, 50% of the shares delivered in April 2010 were subject to 

restrictions on sale and transfer until January 20, 2011. In lieu of 2010 CAP 

awards, certain retirement-eligible employees were instead awarded CSEs 

that were settled by stock payments in April 2010, but the shares delivered are 

subject to restrictions on sale or transfer that will lapse in four equal annual 

installments beginning January 20, 2011. CSE awards were generally accrued 

as compensation expense in the year 2009 and were recorded as a liability 

from the January 2010 grant date until the settlement date in April 2010. CSE 

awards were paid with new issues of common stock as an exception to the 

Company™s then-current practice of delivering shares from treasury stock, and 

the recorded liability was reclassified to equity at that time.Generally, in order to reduce the use of shares under Citigroup™s 
stockholder-approved stock incentive plan, the percentages of total annual 

incentives awarded pursuant to CAP in January 2009 and January 2010 
were reduced and were instead awarded as deferred cash awards in the U.S. 
and the U.K. The deferred cash awards are subject to two-year and four-

year vesting schedules, but the other terms and conditions are the same as 
CAP awards made in those years. The deferred cash awards earn a return 
during the vesting period based on LIBOR; in 2010 only, a portion of the 

deferred cash award was denominated as a stock unit, the value of which will 
fluctuate based on the price of Citi common stock. In both cases, only cash 
will be delivered at vesting. 187In January 2009, members of the Management Executive Committee (except the CEO and CFO) received 30% of their incentive awards for 2008 as performance vesting-equity awards. These awards vest 50% if the price 
of Citigroup common stock meets a price target of $10.61, and 50% for a 
price target of $17.85, in each case on or prior to January 14, 2013. The 
price target will be met only if the NYSE closing price equals or exceeds the 
applicable price target for at least 20 NYSE trading days within any period 
of 30 consecutive NYSE trading days ending on or before January 14, 2013. 
Any shares that have not vested by such date will vest according to a fraction, 
the numerator of which is the share price on the delivery date and the 
denominator of which is the price target of the unvested shares. No dividend 
equivalents are paid on unvested awards. The fair value of the awards is 
recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. This fair 
value was determined using the following assumptions:Weighted-average per-share fair value
$2.30Weighted-average expected life
3.85 yearsValuation assumptions


CAP participants in 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and Financial Advisor CAP (FA CAP) participants in those years and in 2009, could elect to receive 
all or part of their award in stock options. The figures presented in the stock 
option program tables (see ﬁStock Option Programsﬂ below) include options 
granted in lieu of CAP and FA CAP stock awards in those years. 
On July 17, 2007, the Committee approved the Management Committee Long-Term Incentive Plan (MC LTIP) (pursuant to the terms of the 

shareholder-approved 1999 Stock Incentive Plan) under which participants 

received an equity award that could be earned based on Citigroup™s 

performance against various metrics relative to peer companies and publicly 
stated return on equity (ROE) targets measured at the end of each calendar 
year beginning with 2007. The final expense for each of the three consecutive 
calendar years was adjusted based on the results of the ROE tests. No awards 
were earned for 2009, 2008 or 2007 and no shares were issued because 
performance targets were not met. No new awards were made under the MC 
LTIP since the initial award in July 2007. 
A summary of the status of Citigroup™s unvested stock awards at 
December 31, 2010 and changes during the 12 months ended December 31, 
2010 are presented below:Unvested stock awards

At December

 million of total unrecognized 
compensation cost related to unvested stock awards net of the forfeiture provision. 
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. 
Stock Option ProgramsThe Company has a number of stock option programs for its non-employee 
directors, officers and employees. Generally, in January 2008, 2007 and 
2006, stock options were granted only to CAP and FA CAP participants who 
elected to receive stock options in lieu of restricted or deferred stock awards, 
and to non-employee directors who elected to receive their compensation 
in the form of a stock option grant. Beginning in 2009, CAP participants, 
and directors may no longer elect to receive stock options (however, FA 
CAP participants were permitted to make a stock option election for awards 
made in 2009). Occasionally, stock options also may be granted as sign-on 
awards. All stock options are granted on Citigroup common stock with 
exercise prices that are no less than the fair market value at the time of 
grant (which is defined under the plan to be the NYSE closing price on the 
trading day immediately preceding the grant date or on the grant date for 
grants to executive officers). Generally, options granted from 2003 through 
2009 have six-year terms and vest ratably over three- or four-year periods; 
however, directors™ options cliff vest after two years, and vesting schedules for 
sign-on grants may vary. The sale of shares acquired through the exercise 
of employee stock options granted from 2003 through 2008 (and FA CAP 
options granted in 2009) is restricted for a two-year period (and may be 
subject to the stock ownership commitment of senior executives thereafter). 188Prior to 2003, Citigroup options, including options granted since the date of the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, Inc., generally vested at a rate 
of 20% per year over five years (with the first vesting date occurring 12 to 18 
months following the grant date) and had 10-year terms. Certain options, 
mostly granted prior to January 1, 2003 and with 10-year terms, permit an 
employee exercising an option under certain conditions to be granted new 
options (reload options) in an amount equal to the number of common 
shares used to satisfy the exercise price and the withholding taxes due upon 
exercise. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of the related 
original option and vest after six months. Reload options may in turn be 
exercised using the reload method, given certain conditions. An option may 
not be exercised using the reload method unless the market price on the date 
of exercise is at least 20% greater than the option to purchase. On February 14, 2011, Citigroup granted options exercisable for approximately 29 million shares of Citi common stock to certain of its 
executive officers. The options have six-year terms and vest in three equal 
annual installments beginning on February 14, 2012. The exercise price of 
the options is $4.91, which was the closing price of a share of Citi common 
stock on the grant date. On any exercise of the options before the fifth 
anniversary of the grant date, the shares received on exercise (net of the 
amount required to pay taxes and the exercise price) are subject to a one-
year transfer restriction.On April 20, 2010, Citigroup made an option grant to a group of employees who were not eligible for the October 29, 2009, broad-based grant 
described below. The options were awarded with a strike price equal to the 

NYSE closing price on the trading day immediately preceding the date of 
grant ($4.88). The options vest in three annual installments beginning on 
October 29, 2010. The options have a six-year term.On October 29, 2009, Citigroup made a one-time broad-based option grant to employees worldwide. The options have a six-year term, and 
generally vest in three equal installments over three years, beginning on 
the first anniversary of the grant date. The options were awarded with a 
strike price equal to the NYSE closing price on the trading day immediately 
preceding the date of grant ($4.08). The CEO and other employees whose 
2009 compensation was subject to structures approved by the Special Master 
did not participate in this grant.In January 2009, members of the Management Executive Committee received 10% of their awards as performance-priced stock options, with an 
exercise price that placed the awards significantly ﬁout of the moneyﬂ on 
the date of grant. Half of each executive™s options have an exercise price of 

$17.85 and half have an exercise price of $10.61. The options were granted 
on a day on which Citi™s closing price was $4.53. The options have a 10-year 

term and vest ratably over a four-year period. 
On January 22, 2008, Vikram Pandit, CEO, was awarded stock options to 
purchase three million shares of common stock. The options vest 25% per 
year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire on the 
tenth anniversary of the grant date. One-third of the options have an exercise 
price equal to the NYSE closing price of Citigroup stock on the grant date 
($24.40), one-third have an exercise price equal to a 25% premium over 
the grant-date closing price ($30.50), and one-third have an exercise price 
equal to a 50% premium over the grant date closing price ($36.60). The first 
installment of these options vested on January 22, 2009. These options do not 
have a reload feature. From 1997 to 2002, a broad base of employees participated in annual option grant programs. The options vested over five-year periods, or cliff 
vested after five years, and had 10-year terms but no reload features. No 
grants have been made under these programs since 2002.189Information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup stock option programs for the years ended December

Pursuant to the terms of currently outstanding reloadable options, upon 
exercise of an option, if employees use previously owned shares to pay the 
exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax 
withholding, they will receive a reload option covering the same number 
of shares used for such purposes, but only if the market price on the date of 
exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. Reload options 
vest after six months and carry the same expiration date as the option that 
gave rise to the reload grant. The exercise price of a reload grant is the fair-
market value of Citigroup common stock on the date the underlying option 
is exercised. Reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise 
options at an earlier date and to retain the shares acquired. The result of this 
program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are 
able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option 
lives result in lower valuations. However, such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter 
vesting period of reload options. In addition, since reload options are treated 
as separate grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a greater 
number of options being valued. Shares received through option exercises 
under the reload program, as well as certain other options, are subject to 
restrictions on sale. Additional valuation and related assumption information for Citigroup option programs is presented below. Citigroup uses a lattice-type model to

190Profit Sharing Plan In October 2010, the Committee approved awards under the 2010 Key Employee Profit Sharing Plan (KEPSP) which may entitle participants to 
profit-sharing payments based on an initial performance measurement 
period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012. Generally, if a 
participant remains employed and all other conditions to vesting and 
payment are satisfied, the participant will be entitled to an initial payment in 
2013, as well as a holdback payment in 2014 that may be reduced based on 
performance during the subsequent holdback period (generally, January 1, 
2013 through December 31, 2013). If the vesting and performance conditions 

are satisfied, a participant™s initial payment will equal two-thirds of the 
product of the cumulative pretax income for the initial performance period 
and the participant™s applicable percentage. The initial payment will be paid 
after January 20, 2013, but no later than March 15, 2013. The participant™s holdback payment, if any, will equal the product of 
(a) the lesser of cumulative pretax income of Citicorp (Citigroup less Citi 
Holdings) for the initial performance period and cumulative pretax income 
of Citicorp for the initial performance period and the holdback period 
combined (generally, January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2013), and 
 (b) the participant™s applicable percentage, less the initial payment; provided 

that the holdback payment may not be less than zero. The holdback 
payment, if any, will be paid after January 20, 2014
, but no later than 
March 15, 2014. The holdback payment, if any, will be credited with notional 

interest during the holdback period. It is intended that the initial payment 
and holdback payment will be paid in cash; however, awards may be paid 

in Citi common stock if required by regulatory authority. Regulators have 

required that U.K. participants receive 50% of their initial payment and 50% 
of their holdback payment, if any, in shares of Citi common stock that will be 

subject to a six-month sales restriction. In addition to the vesting and performance conditions described above, nonvested or undelivered KEPSP payments are subject to forfeiture or 
reduction if a participant (a) received a payment based on materially 
inaccurate financial statements (including, but not limited to, statements of 
earnings, revenues or gains) or any other materially inaccurate performance 
metric criteria, (b) knowingly engaged in providing inaccurate information 
(including such participant™s knowingly failing to timely correct inaccurate 

information) relating to financial statements or performance metrics,  (c) materially violated any risk limits established by senior management 
and/or risk management, or any balance sheet or working capital guidance 
provided by a business head, or (d) is terminated on account of gross 
misconduct. Independent risk function employees were not eligible to participate in the KEPSP as the independent risk function participates in the determination 
of whether payouts will be made under the KEPSP. Expense taken in 2010 in 

respect of the KEPSP was $48 million.On February 14, 2011, the Committee approved grants of awards under the 2011 KEPSP to certain executive officers. These awards have a 
performance period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 and other terms 
of the awards are similar to the 2010 KEPSP.
Additionally, Citigroup may from time to time introduce incentive plans 
for certain employees that have an incentive-based award component. These 
awards are not material to Citigroup™s operations.
1919. RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension 
and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United 
States. The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash 
balance formula. However, employees satisfying certain age and service 
requirements remain covered by a prior final average pay formula under 
that plan. Effective January 1, 2008, the U.S. qualified pension plan was 
frozen for most employees. Accordingly, no additional compensation-based 
contributions were credited to the cash balance portion of the plan for 
existing plan participants after 2007. However, certain employees covered Net (Benefit) ExpensePension plans

At December 31, 2010, combined accumulated benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, excluding U.S. nonqualified plans, 
exceeded plan assets by $0.4 billion. At December 31, 2009, combined 
accumulated benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, 
excluding U.S. nonqualified plans, exceeded plan assets by $0.5 billion.Discount RateThe discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were selected 

by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plan™s specific 
cash flows and compared with high quality corporate bond indices for 
reasonableness. Citigroup™s policy is to round to the nearest five hundredths 
of a percent. Accordingly, at December 31, 2010, the discount rate was set 
at 5.45% for the pension plans and at 5.10% for the postretirement welfare 
plans. At December 31, 2009, the discount rate was set at 5.90% for the pension plans and 5.55% for the postretirement plans, referencing a Citigroup-specific 
cash flow analysis. The discount rates for the non-U.S. pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in countries that 
have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate 

bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local 
government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk 
for corporate bonds. The discount rate and future rate of compensation assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit 
expense for the Company™s plans are shown in the following table:

49(44)Expected Rate of ReturnCitigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a ﬁbuilding blockﬂ 
approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each 
asset class. A weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on 
target allocations to each asset class. Market performance over a number of 
earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to 
determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any past trends. Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this 
assumption annually unless there are significant changes in investment 
strategy or economic conditions. This contrasts with the selection of 
the discount rate, future compensation increase rate, and certain other 
assumptions, which are reconsidered annually in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. The expected rate of return for the U.S. pension and post-retirement plans was 7.5% at December 31, 2010, 7.75% at December 31, 2009 and 7.75% at 
December 31, 2008, reflecting a change in investment allocations. Actual 
returns in 2010 were more than the expected returns, while actual returns 
in 2009 and 2008 were less than the expected returns. This expected amount 
reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces 
the annual pension expense of Citigroup. It is deducted from the sum of 
service cost, interest and other components of pension expense to arrive at 
the net pension (benefit) expense. Net pension (benefit) expense for the U.S. 
pension plans for 2010, 2009 and 2008 reflects deductions of $874 million, 
$912 million and $949 million of expected returns, respectively. 
The following table shows the expected versus actual rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans: 2010
7.75%
14.11%


For the non-U.S. plans, pension expense for 2010 was reduced by the expected return of $378 million, compared with the actual return of $432 million. Pension expense for 2009 and 2008 was reduced by expected 
returns of $336 million and $487 million, respectively. Actual returns were 

higher in 2009, but lower in 2008, than the expected returns in those years.The expected long-term rates of return on assets used in determining the Company™s pension expense are shown below:

$312$(5)$4$16$(14)$313Investment StrategyCitigroup™s global pension and postretirement funds™ investment strategies are 
to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits 

to participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total 

return that, when combined with Citigroup™s contributions to the funds, will 

maintain the funds™ ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is 

controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic 

and international equities, fixed-income securities and cash. The target asset 

allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is to have the majority of the assets 

in either equity or debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic 

region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and 

various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range 

of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing 

local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in certain 

countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in 

fixed-income investments, government funds, or local-country securities. 
Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan AssetsThe assets of Citigroup™s pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of 

any individual investment. The U.S. pension plan is diversified across multiple 

asset classes, with publicly traded fixed income, hedge funds and private equity 

representing the most significant asset allocations. Investments in these three 

asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers, strategies, vintages, 
sectors and geographies, depending on the specific characteristics of each asset 

class. The pension assets for Citigroup™s largest non-U.S. plans are primarily 

invested in publicly traded fixed income and publicly traded equity securities. 
Risk Management PracticesRisk management oversight for Citigroup™s U.S. pension plans and largest 
non-U.S. pension plans is performed by Citigroup™s Independent Risk 
Management. The risk oversight function covers market risk, credit risk 
and operational risk. Although the specific components of risk oversight 
are tailored to the requirements of each region and of each country, the 
following risk management elements are common to all regions:Periodic asset/liability management and strategic asset allocation studiesMonitoring of funding levels and funding ratiosMonitoring compliance with asset allocation guidelinesMonitoring asset class performance against asset class benchmarksMonitoring investment manager performance against benchmarksQuarterly risk capital measurement Risk management for the remaining non-U.S. pension assets and liabilities is 
performed by Citigroup™s local country management.198ContributionsCitigroup™s pension funding policy for U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans is generally to fund to applicable minimum funding requirements rather 
than to the amounts of accumulated benefit obligations. For the U.S. plans, 
the Company may increase its contributions above the minimum required 
contribution under ERISA, if appropriate to its tax and cash position and 
the plans™ funded position. For the U.S. pension plans, at December 31, 
2010, there were no minimum required cash contributions. During 2010, a 
discretionary cash contribution of $995 million was made to the plan. For 
the non-U.S. pension plans, discretionary cash contributions in 2011 are 
anticipated to be approximately $196 million. In addition, the Company 
expects to contribute $41 million of benefits to be paid directly by the 
Company for its non-U.S. pension plans. For the U.S. postretirement benefit 
plans, there are no expected or required contributions for 2011 other than 
$60 million of benefit payments expected to be paid directly by the Company. 
For the non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans, expected cash contributions 
for 2011 are $74 million including $4 million of benefits to be paid directly 
by the Company. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution 
decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance and 
regulatory requirements. In addition, management has the ability to change 
funding policy. Estimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe Company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in

established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare known as ﬁMedicare 
Part D,ﬂ and a federal subsidy to sponsors of U.S. retiree health-care benefit 
plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare 
Part D. The benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially 
equivalent to Medicare Part D and, accordingly, the Company is entitled to 
a subsidy. The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $139 million and $148 million as of 
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the postretirement expense by 

approximately $9 million and $13 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Medicare Part
 D subsidyThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ﬁAct of 2010ﬂ) were 
signed into law in the U.S. in March 2010. One provision that impacted 
Citigroup was the elimination of the tax deductibility for benefits paid that 
are related to the Medicare Part D subsidy, starting in 2013. Citigroup was 

required to recognize the full accounting impact in 2010, the period in which 
the Act of 2010 was signed. As a result, there was a $45 million reduction in deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to earnings from continuing 
operations. The other provisions of the Act are not expected to have a 
significant impact on Citigroup™s pension and post-retirement plans.
Citigroup 401(k)Under the Citigroup 401(k) plan, a defined-contribution plan, eligible 
U.S. employees received matching contributions of up to 4% of their 
compensation for 2010, subject to statutory limits. Effective January 1, 2011, 
the maximum amount of matching contributions paid on employee deferral 
contributions made into this plan will be increased from the 4% to 6% of 
eligible pay for all employees, subject to statutory limits. The matching 
contribution is invested according to participants™ individual elections. 
Additionally, for eligible employees whose compensation is $100,000 or less, 
a fixed contribution of up to 2% of compensation is provided.The pretax expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately $301 million, $442 million and $580 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, 
respectively. The decrease in expense from 2008 to 2009 reflects the reduction 

in participants due to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture and 
other reductions in workforce, and the decrease from 2009 to 2010 reflects 
the 4% matching contribution rate in effect for 2010. 19910. INCOME TAXES In millions of dollars2010 Current$(249)3,239

201The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the world. It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax 
benefits may occur within the next 12 months, but the Company does not 
expect such audits to result in amounts that would cause a significant 
change to its effective tax rate. The following are the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate and the earliest tax year subject to examination: JurisdictionTax
 year



Foreign pretax earnings approximated $12.3 billion in 2010, $6.1 billion in 2009 and $9.3 billion in 2008 (of which, $0.1 billion profit, $0.6 billion loss and $4.4 billion profit, respectively, are in discontinued operations). As 

a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject 
to U.S. taxation on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch.  
Pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S. taxation 
when effectively repatriated. The Company provides income taxes on the 
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such 
earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31, 
2010, $32.1 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. 
subsidiaries were indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. federal income 
tax rate, additional taxes (net of U.S. foreign tax credits) of $8.6 billion 
would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently. 

The current year™s effect on the income tax expense from continuing 

operations is included in the ﬁForeign income tax rate differentialﬂ line in 
the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company™s effective 

income tax rate.Income taxes are not provided for the Company™s ﬁsavings bank base year 
bad debt reservesﬂ that arose before 1988, because under current U.S. tax 
rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are 
distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2010, 

the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $358 million 
(subject to a tax of $125 million).The Company has no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In billions of dollarsJurisdiction/ComponentDTA balance

 (1)$7.1202With respect to the New York NOLs, the Company has recorded a net 
deferred tax asset of $1.1 billion, along with less significant net operating losses in various other states for which the Company has recorded a net 
deferred tax asset of $0.6 billion and which expire between 2012 and 
2031. In addition, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets in foreign 
subsidiaries, for which an assertion has been made that the earnings 
are indefinitely reinvested, for foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
of $487 million (which expire in 2012Œ2019) and $60 million (with no 
expiration), respectively.
Although realization is not assured, the Company believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $52.1 billion is more 
likely than not based upon expectations as to future taxable income in the 
jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and available tax planning strategies, 

as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes
, (formerly SFAS 109) that would be 

implemented, if necessary, to prevent a carryforward from expiring. Included 

in the net U.S. federal DTA of $41.6
 billion are $4 billion in DTLs that will 
reverse in the relevant carryforward period and may be used to support the 
DTA, and $0.3
 billion in compensation deductions that reduced additional 
paid-in capital in January 2011 and for which no adjustment was permitted 
to such DTA at December 31, 2010 because the related stock compensation 

was not yet deductible to Citi. In general, the Company would need to 
generate approximately $105 billion of taxable income during the respective 
carryforward periods to fully realize its U.S. federal, state and local DTAs.
As a result of the losses incurred in 2008 and 2009, the Company is in a three-year cumulative pretax loss position at December 31, 2010. A 
cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in 
assessing the realizability of a DTA. The Company has concluded that 

there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence. The 
positive evidence includes two means by which the Company is able to fully 
realize its DTA. First, the Company forecasts sufficient taxable income in the 

carryforward period, exclusive of tax planning strategies, even under stressed 
scenarios. Secondly, the Company has sufficient tax planning strategies, 

including potential sales of businesses and assets, in which it could realize 
the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of its assets. The amount 
of the DTA considered realizable, however, is necessarily subject to the 

Company™s estimates of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it 

operates during the respective carryforward periods, which is in turn subject 
to overall market and global economic conditions. Based upon the foregoing discussion, as well as tax planning opportunities and other factors discussed below, the U.S. federal and New 

York State and City net operating loss carryforward period of 20 years provides 

enough time to utilize the DTAs pertaining to the existing net operating loss 

carryforwards and any NOL that would be created by the reversal of the future 
net deductions that have not yet been taken on a tax return. The U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward period is 10 years. In addition, utilization of foreign tax credits in any year is restricted to 35% of foreign 
source taxable income in that year. Further, overall domestic losses that 

the Company has incurred of approximately $47 billion are allowed to be 
reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of 50% of domestic source 
income produced in subsequent years and such resulting foreign source 
income is in fact sufficient to cover the foreign tax credits being carried forward. As such, the foreign source taxable income limitation will not be 
an impediment to the foreign tax credit carryforward usage as long as the 
Company can generate sufficient domestic taxable income within the 10-year 
carryforward period. Under U.S. tax law, NOL carry-forwards must generally 

be used against taxable income before foreign tax credits (FTCs) or general 
business credits (GBCs) can be utilized. Regarding the estimate of future taxable income, the Company has projected its pretax earnings predominantly based upon the ﬁcoreﬂ 
businesses in Citicorp that the Company intends to conduct going forward. 
These ﬁcoreﬂ businesses have produced steady and strong earnings in the 
past. In 2010, operating trends were positive and credit costs improved. The 
Company has already taken steps to reduce its cost structure. Taking these 

items into account, the Company is projecting that it will generate sufficient 
pretax earnings within the 10-year carryforward period alluded to above 
to be able to fully utilize the foreign tax credit carryforward, in addition to 
any foreign tax credits produced in such period. Until the U.S. federal NOL 
carryforward is fully utilized, the FTCs and GBCs will likely continue to 
increase. The Company™s net DTA will decline as additional domestic GAAP 

taxable income is generated.The Company has also examined tax planning strategies available to it in accordance with ASC 740 that would be employed, if necessary, to 

prevent a carryforward from expiring. These strategies include repatriating 
low-taxed foreign source earnings for which an assertion that the earnings 
are indefinitely reinvested has not been made, accelerating U.S. taxable 
income into or deferring U.S. tax deductions out of the latter years of the 
carryforward period (e.g., selling appreciated intangible assets and electing 
straight-line depreciation), accelerating deductible temporary differences 
outside the U.S., holding onto available-for-sale debt securities with losses 

until they mature and selling certain assets that produce tax exempt income, 
while purchasing assets that produce fully taxable income. In addition, 
the sale or restructuring of certain businesses can produce significant U.S. 
taxable income within the relevant carryforward periods. The Company™s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income 
may be significantly limited if the Company experiences an ﬁownership 
change,ﬂ as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (the ﬁCodeﬂ). In general, an ownership change will occur if there 
is a cumulative change in the Company™s ownership by ﬁ5% shareholdersﬂ 

(as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling 
three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will 
generally be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change 
DTAs equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership 

change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain 
adjustments), provided that the annual limitation would be increased 
each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. 

The limitation arising from an ownership change under Section 382 on 
Citigroup™s ability to utilize its DTAs will depend on the value of Citigroup™s 

stock at the time of the ownership change. Under IRS Notice 2010-2, 
Citigroup did not experience an ownership change within the meaning 
of Section 382 as a result of the sales of its common stock held by the 
U.S. Treasury.

earnings per common share, because the performance targets under the 
terms of the awards were not met and, as a result, the awards expired in the 
first quarter of 2010. In addition, the other performance-based equity awards 
of approximately 5 million shares were not included in the 2010 and 2009 
earnings per share calculation, because the performance targets under the

and LiquidityŠFunding and Liquidityﬂ above.It is the Company™s policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, 
monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements 
and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral or 

reduction in the balance in order to maintain contractual margin protection. 
In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement provides the 
Company with the right to liquidate the collateral held.The majority of the resale and repurchase agreements are recorded at fair value. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the respective 
agreements. Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net 
by counterparty, when applicable. Excluding the impact of the allowable 

netting, resale agreements totaled $184.6 billion and $166.0 billion at 
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
A majority of the deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received and are collateralized principally by government and government-
agency securities and corporate debt and equity securities. The remaining 
portion is recorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value 
option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios. With respect 
to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount 
generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned. The Company 

monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned daily, 

and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and 

securities loaned are reported net by counterparty, when applicable. 
20513. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE PAYABLESThe Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments 
purchased from and sold to brokers, dealers and customers. The Company is 
exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers or customers to 
pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case 
the Company would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at 
prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange 
or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction.The Company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral 
in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are 
monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required. 

Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, the Company will 
liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer 
into compliance with the required margin level.Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair 
the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits 

are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers and dealers 
engaged in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit 
sensitive.Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables, which arise in the normal course of business, consisted of the following at December 31:In millions of dollars2010

At December 31, 2010, the cost of approximately 3,000 investments in equity and fixed-income securities exceeded their fair value by $3.876 billion. 
Of the $3.876 billion, the gross unrealized loss on equity securities was 
$211 million. Of the remainder, $728
 million represents fixed-income 
investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position for less than a 
year and, of these, 99% are rated investment grade; $2.937 billion represents 
fixed-income investments that have been in a gross-unrealized-loss position 
for a year or more and, of these, 90% are rated investment grade.The available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities-portfolio fair value 
balance of $26.506 billion consists of $23.623 billion of government-
sponsored agency securities, and $2.883 billion of privately sponsored 
securities of which the majority is backed by mortgages that are not Alt-A 
or subprime. The increase in gross unrealized losses on state and municipal debt securities was the result of general tax-exempt municipal yields increasing 
relatively faster than the yields on taxable fixed income instruments and the 
effects of hedge accounting.As discussed in more detail below, the Company conducts and documents 
periodic reviews of all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether 
the impairment is other than temporary. Any credit-related impairment 

related to debt securities the Company does not plan to sell and is not 
likely to be required to sell is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income, with the non-credit-related impairment recognized in OCI. For 
other impaired debt securities, the entire impairment is recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.207The table below shows the fair value of AFS securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:Less than 12 months12 months or longerTotal

The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI relate to debt securities reclassified from AFS investments to HTM investments. Additionally, for 

HTM securities that have suffered credit impairment, declines in fair value 
for reasons other than credit losses are recorded in AOCI. The AOCI balance 
was $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared to $7.6 billion as of 
December 31, 2009. The AOCI balance for HTM securities is amortized over 
the remaining life of the related securities as an adjustment of yield in a 
manner consistent with the accretion of discount on the same debt securities. 
This will have no impact on the Company™s net income because the 

amortization of the unrealized holding loss reported in equity will offset the 
effect on interest income of the accretion of the discount on these securities.The credit-related impairment on HTM securities is recognized in earnings.210The table below shows the fair value of investments in HTM that have been in an unrecognized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer

211Evaluating Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments The Company conducts and documents periodic reviews of all securities 
with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is other than 
temporary. Prior to January 1, 2009, these reviews were conducted pursuant 
to FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-
Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments (now incorporated into ASC 320-10-35, InvestmentsŠDebt and Equity 
SecuritiesŠSubsequent Measurement). Any unrealized loss identified as 
other than temporary was recorded directly in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income. As of January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FSP FAS 115-2 and 
FAS 124-2 (now incorporated into ASC 320-10-35-34, InvestmentsŠDebt and Equity Securities: Recognition of an Other-Than-Temporary 
Impairment). This guidance amends the impairment model for debt 
securities; the impairment model for equity securities was not affected.Under the guidance for debt securities, other-than-temporary impairment 
(OTTI) is recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company has an 
intent to sell or that the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that it 
will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. For those 
securities that the Company does not intend to sell or expect to be required to 
sell, credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the non-credit-
related impairment recorded in AOCI. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses that are 
determined to be temporary in nature are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI for 
AFS securities, while such losses related to HTM securities are not recorded, 
as these investments are carried at their amortized cost. For securities 
transferred to HTM from Trading account assets
, amortized cost is defined 
as the fair value of the securities at the date of transfer, plus any accretion 

income and less any impairment recognized in earnings subsequent to 
transfer. For securities transferred to HTM from AFS, amortized cost is defined 

as the original purchase cost, plus or minus any accretion or amortization 
of a purchase discount or premium, less any impairment recognized in 
earnings subsequent to transfer. 
Regardless of the classification of the securities as AFS or HTM, the Company has assessed each position for impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost; the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer that may indicate adverse credit conditions; and 
the Company™s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. The Company™s review for impairment generally entails: 
identification and evaluation of investments that have indications of possible impairment; analysis of individual investments that have fair values less than amortized cost, including consideration of the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the expected 
recovery period; discussion of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as having other-than-temporary impairment and those that would not support 
other-than-temporary impairment; and documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under business policies. For equity securities, management considers the various factors described above, including its intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for recovery to cost. Where management lacks that 
intent or ability, the security™s decline in fair value is deemed to be other 

than temporary and is recorded in earnings. AFS equity securities deemed 
other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to fair value, with the full 

difference between fair value and cost recognized in earnings.For debt securities that are not deemed to be credit impaired, management assesses whether it intends to sell or whether it is more-likely-
than-not that it would be required to sell the investment before the expected 
recovery of the amortized cost basis. In most cases, management has asserted 
that it has no intent to sell and that it believes it is not likely to be required to 
sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Where such an 
assertion has not been made, the security™s decline in fair value is deemed to 

be other than temporary and is recorded in earnings.For debt securities, a critical component of the evaluation for OTTI is the identification of credit impaired securities, where management does not 
expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost 
basis of the security. For securities purchased and classified as AFS with the 

expectation of receiving full principal and interest cash flows as of the date of 
purchase, this analysis considers the likelihood of receiving all contractual 
principal and interest. For securities reclassified out of the trading category in 
the fourth quarter of 2008, the analysis considers the likelihood of receiving 
the expected principal and interest cash flows anticipated as of the date of 
reclassification in the fourth quarter of 2008. The extent of the Company™s 

analysis regarding credit quality and the stress on assumptions used in the 
analysis have been refined for securities where the current fair value or other 
characteristics of the security warrant. The paragraphs below describe the 
Company™s process for identifying credit impairment in security types with 

the most significant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010. 212Mortgage-backed securitiesFor U.S. mortgage-backed securities (and in particular for Alt-A and other 
mortgage-backed securities that have significant unrealized losses as a 
percentage of amortized cost), credit impairment is assessed using a cash 
flow model that estimates the cash flows on the underlying mortgages, using 
the security-specific collateral and transaction structure. The model estimates 
cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans and distributes those cash 
flows to various tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure 
and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure. 
The cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgage-backed 
securities through the current period and then projects the remaining cash 
flows using a number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment 
rates, and recovery rates (on foreclosed properties).Management develops specific assumptions using as much market data as possible and includes internal estimates as well as estimates published 
by rating agencies and other third-party sources. Default rates are projected 
by considering current underlying mortgage loan performance, generally 
assuming the default of (1) 10% of current loans, (2) 25% of 30Œ59 day 
delinquent loans, (3) 70% of 60Œ90 day delinquent loans and (4) 100% 
of 91+ day delinquent loans. These estimates are extrapolated along a 
default timing curve to estimate the total lifetime pool default rate. Other 
assumptions used contemplate the actual collateral attributes, including 
geographic concentrations, rating agency loss projections, rating actions and 
current market prices.The key assumptions for mortgage-backed securities as of December 31, 2010 are in the table below:December 31, 2010

3%Œ8% CRR45%Œ85%
9.8%




The valuation as of December 31, 2010 assumes that U.S. housing prices will increase 1.2% in 2011, increase 1.8% in 2012 and increase 3% per year 
from 2013 onwards.In addition, cash flow projections are developed using more stressful parameters. Management assesses the results of those stress tests (including 
the severity of any cash shortfall indicated and the likelihood of the stress 
scenarios actually occurring based on the underlying pool™s characteristics 

and performance) to assess whether management expects to recover the 
amortized cost basis of the security. If cash flow projections indicate that the 

Company does not expect to recover its amortized cost basis, the Company 
recognizes the estimated credit loss in earnings.State and municipal securitiesCitigroup™s AFS state and municipal bonds consist mainly of bonds that are 
financed through Tender Option Bond programs. The process for identifying 
credit impairment for bonds in this program as well as for bonds that 
were previously financed in this program is largely based on third-party 
credit ratings. Individual bond positions must meet minimum ratings 
requirements, which vary based on the sector of the bond issuer.Citigroup monitors the bond issuer and insurer ratings on a daily basis. The average portfolio rating, ignoring any insurance, is Aa3/AA-. In the event 
of a downgrade of the bond below Aa3/AA-, the subject bond is specifically 
reviewed for potential shortfall in contractual principal and interest. 
Citigroup has not recorded any credit impairments on bonds held as part of 
the Tender Option Bond program or on bonds that were previously held as 

part of the Tender Option Bond program.
The remainder of Citigroup™s AFS state and municipal bonds are 
specifically reviewed for credit impairment based on instrument-specific 
estimates of cash flows, probability of default and loss given default.Because Citigroup does not intend to sell the AFS state and municipal bond securities or expect to be required to sell them prior to recovery, the 

unrealized losses associated with the AFS state and municipal bond portfolio 
(other than credit-related losses) remain classified in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are not reclassified into earnings as other-than-

temporary impairment.Recognition and Measurement of OTTIThe following table presents the total OTTI recognized in earnings during the 12 months ended December 31, 2010:OTTI on Investments

equity funds, fund of funds and real estate funds. The Company™s investments 

include co-investments in funds that are managed by the Company and investments in funds that are managed by third parties. Investments in 
funds are generally classified as non-marketable equity securities carried at 
fair value.The fair values of these investments are estimated using the NAV per share 
of the Company™s ownership interest in the funds, where it is not probable 

that the Company will sell an investment at a price other than NAV.

Citigroup has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its Consumer loan portfolio. Included in the loan table above are lending products whose terms 
may give rise to additional credit issues. Credit cards with below-market 
introductory interest rates and interest-only loans are examples of such 
products. However, these products are not material to Citigroup™s financial 

position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their 
additional inherent risk.Credit quality indicators that are actively monitored include:Delinquency StatusDelinquency status is carefully monitored and considered a key indicator of 
credit quality. Substantially all of the U.S. first mortgage loans use the MBA method of reporting delinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a 
monthly payment has not been received by the end of the day immediately 
preceding the loan™s next due date. All other loans use the OTS method of 
reporting delinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly 
payment has not been received by the close of business on the loan™s next 
due date. As a general rule, first and second mortgages and installment loans 
are classified as non-accrual when loan payments are 90 days contractually 
past due. Credit cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue 
interest until payments are 180 days past due. Commercial market loans are 
placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual 
experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan 
in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest 
or principal is 90 days past due.216The following table provides details on Citigroup™s Consumer loan delinquency and non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2010:Consumer Loan Delinquency and Non-Accrual Details at December 31, 2010In millions of dollars 30Œ89 days past due (1) 90 days past due  (2)90 days past due and accruing  (3)Total

Consumer Credit Scores (FICOs)In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual™s risk for 
assuming debt based on the individual™s credit history and assign every 
consumer a credit score. These scores are often called ﬁFICO scoresﬂ because 
most credit bureau scores used in the U.S. are produced from software 
developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. Scores range from a high of 850 (which 
indicates high credit quality) to 300. These scores are continually updated 
by the agencies based upon an individual™s credit actions (e.g., taking out 
a loan, missed or late payments, etc.). The following table provides details 
on the FICO scores attributable to Citi™s U.S. Consumer loan portfolio as of 
December 31, 2010 (note that commercial market loans are not included 
since they are business based and FICO scores are not a primary driver in 
their credit evaluation). FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis. FICO Score Distribution in U.S. Portfolio

217Residential Mortgage Loan to Values (LTVs)Loan to value (LTV) ratios are important credit indicators for U.S. mortgage 
loans. These ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are calculated 
at origination and updated by applying market price data. The following 
table provides details on the LTV ratios attributable to Citi™s U.S. mortgage 
portfolios as of December 31, 2010. LTVs are updated monthly using the most 
recent Core Logic HPI data available for substantially all of the portfolio

Impaired Consumer LoansImpaired loans are those where Citigroup believes it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms 
of the loan. Impaired Consumer loans include non-accrual commercial 
market loans as well as smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms 
have been modified due to the borrower™s financial difficulties and Citigroup 
has granted a concession to the borrower. These modifications may include 
interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness. Impaired Consumer 
loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous loans that have not been 
modified and are carried on a non-accrual basis, as well as substantially all 
loans modified pursuant to Citi™s short-term modification programs (i.e., for 
periods of 12 months or less). At December 31, 2010, loans included in these 
short-term programs amounted to $5.7 billion.Valuation allowances for impaired Consumer loans are determined in 
accordance with ASC 310-10-35 considering all available evidence including, 
as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted 
at the loan™s original contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of 

the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs.The following table presents information about total impaired Consumer loans at and for the periods ending December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively:Impaired Consumer LoansAt and for the period ended Dec. 31, 2010

Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash 
(non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and 
a forward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the 

payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 

90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process 

of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases 

is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is 

thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. 

When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all 

cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the 

loan. While Corporate loans are generally managed based on their internally 
assigned risk rating (see further discussion below), the following table presents

Citigroup has a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its Corporate loan 
portfolio. As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns risk ratings 
to its Corporate loans, which are reviewed at least annually. The ratings 

scale generally corresponds to the ratings as defined by S&P and Moody™s, 

with investment grade facilities generally exhibiting no evident weakness 
in creditworthiness and non-investment grade facilities exhibiting a range 
of deterioration in the obligor™s creditworthiness or vulnerability to adverse 

changes in business, financial or other economic conditions. 219The following table presents Corporate credit quality information as of December 31, 2010:Corporate Loans Credit Quality Indicators

Corporate loans and leases identified as impaired and placed on non-accrual status are written down to the extent that principal is judged to 
be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where 
repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying 
collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, 
are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans 
are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest 
amounts are reasonably assured of repayment, and there is a sustained 
period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. 220The following table presents non-accrual loan information by Corporate loan type at and for the period ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively:Non-Accrual Corporate LoansAt and for the period ended Dec. 31, 2010

221Included in the Corporate and Consumer loan tables above are purchased distressed loans, which are loans that have evidenced significant credit deterioration subsequent to origination but prior to acquisition by Citigroup. 
In accordance with SOP 03-3, the difference between the total expected cash 
flows for these loans and the initial recorded investments is recognized in 
income over the life of the loans using a level yield. Accordingly, these loans 

have been excluded from the impaired loan information presented above. 
In addition, per SOP 03-3, subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows 
for a purchased distressed loan require a build of an allowance so the loan retains its level yield. However, increases in the expected cash flows are first 

recognized as a reduction of any previously established allowance and then 
recognized as income prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by 
increasing the loan™s level yield. Where the expected cash flows cannot be 

reliably estimated, the purchased distressed loan is accounted for under the 
cost recovery method.The carrying amount of the Company™s purchased distressed loan 
portfolio at December 31, 2010 was $392 million, net of an allowance of 
$77 million as of December 31, 2010.The changes in the accretable yield, related allowance and carrying amount net of accretable yield for 2010 are as follows:In millions of dollarsAccretable yieldCarrying

Goodwill impairment testing is performed at a level below the business segments (referred to as a reporting unit). The reporting unit structure in 2010 is consistent with those reporting units identified in the second quarter 
of 2009 as a result of the change in organizational structure. During 2010, 
goodwill was allocated to disposals and tested for impairment for each of the reporting units. The Company performed goodwill impairment testing 
for all reporting units as of July 1, 2010. Additionally, an interim goodwill 

impairment test was performed for the Brokerage and Asset Management 
and Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
reporting units as of May 1, 2010 
and May 31, 2010, respectively. No goodwill was written off due to 

impairment in 2009 and 2010.During 2008, the share prices of financial stocks continued to be very volatile and were under considerable pressure in sustained turbulent markets. 

In such an environment, Citigroup™s market capitalization remained below 

book value for most of the period and the Company performed goodwill 
impairment testing for all reporting units as of February 28, 2008, July 
1, 2008 and December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, there was an 
indication of impairment in the North America Regional Consumer 
Banking, Latin America Consumer Banking and Local Consumer 
LendingŠOther reporting units and, accordingly, the second step of testing 

was performed on these reporting units.Based on the results of the second step of testing at December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a $9.6 billion pretax ($8.7 billion after tax) goodwill 
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008, representing most of the 
goodwill allocated to these reporting units. The impairment was composed of 
a $2.3 billion pretax charge ($2.0 billion after tax) related to North America Regional Consumer Banking, a $4.3 billion pretax charge ($4.1 billion 
after tax) related to Latin America Regional Consumer Banking and a 
$3.0 billion pretax charge ($2.6 billion after tax) related to Local Consumer LendingŠOther.224The following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances as of December 31, 2010, and the excess of fair value as a percentage over allocated book value as of the annual impairment test.In millions of dollarsReporting unit (1)Fair value as a % of

While no impairment was noted in step one of Citigroup™s 
Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
reporting unit impairment test at July 1, 2010, goodwill present in the reporting unit may be sensitive to further 
deterioration as the valuation of the reporting unit is particularly dependent 
upon economic conditions that affect consumer credit risk and behavior. 

Citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist 
in the valuation of the reporting unit at July 1, 2010, using a combination 
of the market approach and income approach consistent with the valuation 
model used in past practice, which considered the impact of the penalty fee 
provisions associated with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and 
Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) that were implemented during 2010.Under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit, the key assumption is the selected price multiple. The selection of the multiple 
considers the operating performance and financial condition of the Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
operations as compared with those of a group 
of selected publicly traded guideline companies and a group of selected 
acquired companies. Among other factors, the level and expected growth in 
return on tangible equity relative to those of the guideline companies and 
guideline transactions is considered. Since the guideline company prices used 
are on a minority interest basis, the selection of the multiple considers the 
guideline acquisition prices, which reflect control rights and privileges, in 
arriving at a multiple that reflects an appropriate control premium.For the Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
valuation under the income approach, the assumptions used as the basis for the model include cash 
flows for the forecasted period, the assumptions embedded in arriving at 
an estimation of the terminal value and the discount rate. The cash flows 
for the forecasted period are estimated based on management™s most recent 

projections available as of the testing date, giving consideration to targeted 
equity capital requirements based on selected public guideline companies 
for the reporting unit. In arriving at the terminal value for Local Consumer LendingŠCards,
 using 2013 as the terminal year, the assumptions used 
include a long-term growth rate and a price-to-tangible book multiple based 
on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit. The discount 
rate is based on the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity capital computed 

under the capital asset pricing model.Embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model, described above, is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility 
that economic conditions may deteriorate or other events will occur that 
will impact the business model for Local Consumer LendingŠCards. 

While there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in 
developing management™s forecasts, the Company utilized a discount rate at 

July 1, 2010 that it believes reflects the risk characteristics and uncertainty 
specific to management™s forecasts and assumptions for the 
Local Consumer 
LendingŠCards 
reporting unit.Two primary categories of events exist
Šeconomic conditions in the U.S. and regulatory actionsŠwhich, if they were to occur, could 

negatively affect key assumptions used in the valuation of Local Consumer LendingŠCards. 
Small deterioration in the assumptions used in the 
valuations, in particular the discount-rate and growth-rate assumptions 
used in the net income projections, could significantly affect Citigroup™s 

impairment evaluation and, hence, results. If the future were to differ 
adversely from management™s best estimate of key economic assumptions, 

and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin, Citi could 
potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to 
$4,560 million of goodwill remaining in the Local Consumer LendingŠCards 
reporting unit. Any such charges, by themselves, would not negatively 
affect Citi™s Tier 1 and Total Capital regulatory ratios, Tier 1 Common ratio, 

its Tangible Common Equity or Citi™s liquidity position.

227CGMHI has committed long-term financing facilities with unaffiliated banks. At December 31, 2010, CGMHI had drawn down the full $900 million available under these facilities, of which $150 million is guaranteed by 
Citigroup. Generally, a bank can terminate these facilities by giving CGMHI 

one-year prior notice.The Company issues both fixed and variable rate debt in a range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to 
effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt and variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives 
generally corresponds to the maturity structure of the debt being hedged. 
In addition, the Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the 
foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2010, 
the Company™s overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt 

was 3.53% on a contractual basis and 2.78% including the effects of 
derivative contracts.Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates) including trust preferred securities are as follows:Long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 includes $18,131 million and $19,345 million, respectively, of junior subordinated 

debt. The Company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the 
State of Delaware. The trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing 
trust securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of 
the trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the trust securities in junior 
subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of 
its parent; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental

depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., are subject to 
similar guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory 
agencies. These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include 
the required minimums shown in the following table.The regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital 
standards. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of Citigroup™s U.S. insured 

subsidiary depository institutions were ﬁwell capitalized.ﬂAt December 31, 2010, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the U.S. federal bank regulators is as follows:In millions of dollarsRequired minimumWell-

Banking SubsidiariesŠConstraints on DividendsThere are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroup™s subsidiary 

depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply 

funds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. Currently, the approval of 

the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or 

the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required 

if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by 

the applicable agency™s regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are 

subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law.In determining the dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio 
requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies 
that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out 
of current operating earnings. Citigroup did not receive any dividends from 
its banking subsidiaries during 2010.Non-Banking SubsidiariesCitigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries. These 
non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on 
dividends.The ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

23122. SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESOverviewCitigroup and its subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance-sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities (SPEs). See Note 1 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of changes to the 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and consolidation 
of variable interest entities (VIEs), including the elimination of qualifying 
SPEs (QSPEs).Uses of SPEsAn SPE is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company 
that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs are to obtain liquidity and 
favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroup™s financial 
assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets, and to create 
investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized in many legal 
forms including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, the 
company transferring assets to an SPE converts all (or a portion) of those 
assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course 
of business, through the SPE™s issuance of debt and equity instruments, 
certificates, commercial paper and other notes of indebtedness, which are 
recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE and not reflected in the transferring 
company™s balance sheet, assuming applicable accounting requirements 
are satisfied. Investors usually have recourse to the assets in the SPE and 
often benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account 
or over-collateralization in the form of excess assets in the SPE, a line of 
credit, or from a liquidity facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset 
purchase agreement. The SPE can typically obtain a more favorable credit 
rating from rating agencies than the transferor could obtain for its own debt 
issuances, resulting in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. 
The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield 
or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors 
or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider 
of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related 
derivative contracts. Since QSPEs were eliminated, most of Citigroup™s SPEs 
are now VIEs.Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are entities that have either a total equity investment that is insufficient to 

permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial 

support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling 

financial
 interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions through voting rights, 
and right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to 

absorb the expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through 

debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, 

such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative 

contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity. Since January 1, 2010, the 

variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE 

is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Citigroup 

would be deemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary 
beneficiary if it has both of the following characteristics:power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity™s economic performance; andobligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The Company must evaluate its involvement in each VIE and understand the purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in the entity™s 
design, and its involvement in its ongoing activities. The Company then 
must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE™s economic 

performance, the Company then must evaluate its economic interests, if any, 

and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the Company 
has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant, it 
considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of 
probability. Such obligations could be in various forms, including but not 

limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity agreements, 
and certain derivative contracts.Prior to January 1, 2010, the variable interest holder, if any, that would 
absorb a majority of the entity™s expected losses, receive a majority of the 

entity™s residual returns, or both, was deemed to be the primary beneficiary and 

consolidated the VIE. Consolidation of the VIE was determined based primarily 

on the variability generated in scenarios that are considered most likely to 

occur, rather than on scenarios that are considered more remote. In many 

cases, a detailed quantitative analysis was required to make this determination.In various other transactions, the Company may act as a derivative counterparty (for example, interest rate swap, cross-currency swap, or 
purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE); 
may act as underwriter or placement agent; may provide administrative, 
trustee, or other services; or may make a market in debt securities or 
other instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers such 
involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of 
power or potentially significant benefits or losses.232Citigroup™s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs with which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing

234The previous table does not include:certain venture capital investments made by some of the Company™s private equity subsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide;certain limited partnerships that are investment funds that qualify for the deferral from the requirements of SFAS 167 where the Company is the general partner and the limited partners have the right to replace the 
general partner or liquidate the funds;certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;VIEs structured by third parties where the Company holds securities in inventory. These investments are made on arm™s-length terms;
certain positions in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as Trading account assets or Investments, where the Company has no other involvement with the 
related securitization entity. For more information on these positions, see 
Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements;certain representations and warranties exposures in Securities and Banking mortgage-backed and asset-backed securitizations, where the 
Company has no variable interest or continuing involvement as servicer. 
The outstanding balance of the loans securitized was approximately 
$23 billion at December 31, 2010, related to transactions sponsored by 
Securities and Banking during the period 2005 to 2008; andcertain representations and warranties exposures in Consumer mortgage securitizations, where the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding.Prior to January 1, 2010, the table did not include:assets transferred to a VIE where the transfer did not qualify as a sale and where the Company did not have any other involvement that is deemed 
to be a variable interest with the VIE. These transfers are accounted for as 
secured borrowings by the Company.The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may 

represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending 
on the legal form of the asset (e.g., security or loan) and the Company™s 

standard accounting policies for the asset type and line of business.The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs where the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available 
to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized 

cost basis without regard to impairments in fair value, unless fair value 
information is readily available to the Company. For VIEs that obtain 

asset exposures synthetically through derivative instruments (for example, 
synthetic CDOs), the table includes the full original notional amount of the 
derivative as an asset.The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company™s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial 

amount of cash invested in the VIE plus any accrued interest and is adjusted 
for any impairments in value recognized in earnings and any cash principal 
payments received. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents 
the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit 
facilities provided by the Company, or the notional amount of a derivative 

instrument considered to be a variable interest, adjusted for any declines 
in fair value recognized in earnings. In certain transactions, the Company 
has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not 
considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps, or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection 
under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays 
the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such 
arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.235Funding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated VIEsŠLiquidity Facilities and Loan CommitmentsThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the SPE table as of

securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets 
remain on the Company™s balance sheet. The consolidated VIEs included 
in the tables below represent hundreds of separate entities with which the 
Company is involved. In general, the third-party investors in the obligations 
of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the VIEs and do 
not have recourse to the Company, except where the Company has provided 
a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative 
transactions involving the VIE. In addition, the assets are generally restricted 
only to pay such liabilities.Thus, the Company™s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated 

VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE 
assets due to outstanding third-party financing. Intercompany assets and 
liabilities are excluded from the table. All assets are restricted from being sold 
or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source 
used to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to the 
Company™s general assets.The following table presents the carrying amounts and classifications of 
consolidated assets that are collateral for consolidated VIE and SPE obligations.In billions of dollarsDecember 31, 2010

$0.4$0.5$0.9237Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Company securitizes credit card receivables through trusts that are 
established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into 
the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving 
securitizations; that is, as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash 
proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables 
in the trust. Prior to 2010, such transfers were accounted for as sale 
transactions under SFAS 140 and, accordingly, the sold assets were removed 
from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a gain or loss was recognized 
in connection with the transaction. With the adoption of SFAS 167, beginning 
in 2010 the trusts are treated as consolidated entities, because, as servicer, 
Citigroup has power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts and also holds a seller™s interest and 
certain securities issued by the trusts, and provides liquidity facilities to the 
trusts, which could result in potentially significant losses or benefits from 
the trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables are required to 
remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with no gain or loss recognized. 
The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.The Company relies on securitizations to fund a significant portion of its credit card businesses in North America. The following table reflects

Credit Card SecuritizationsŠCiticorpNo gain or loss from securitization was recognized in 2010, since the transfer 
of credit card receivables to the trust did not meet the criteria for sale accounting. In the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company 
recorded net gains (losses) from securitization of Citicorp™s credit card 
receivables of $349 million and $(1,007) million, respectively. Net gains 
(losses) reflect the following:incremental gains (losses) from new securitizations;the reversal of the allowance for loan losses associated with receivables sold;net gains on replenishments of the trust assets offset by other-than-temporary impairments; andchanges in fair value for the portion of the residual interest classified as trading assets.238The following table summarizes selected cash flow information related to Citicorp™s credit card securitizations for the years ended December

The constant prepayment rate assumption range reflects the projected payment rates over the life of a credit card balance, excluding new card purchases. This results in a high payment in the early life of the securitized 
balances followed by a much lower payment rate, which is depicted in the 
disclosed range.Managed LoansAs previously mentioned, prior to 2010, securitized receivables were treated as 
sold and removed from the balance sheet. Beginning in 2010, substantially 
all securitized credit card receivables are included in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Accordingly, the managed-basis (managed) presentation is 
only relevant prior to 2010.After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing 
for receivables transferred to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the 
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages.Managed presentations are non-GAAP financial measures. Managed presentations include results from both the on-balance-sheet loans and off-
balance-sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity. 

Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and 
present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as Citigroup™s 

owned loans. Citigroup™s management believes that managed presentations 

provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance 
comparability of those results in prior periods as well as demonstrating the 
effects of unusual gains and charges in the current period. Management 
further believes that a meaningful analysis of the Company™s financial 

performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that 
performance and that investors find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial 
measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual 
items that may obscure trends in Citigroup™s underlying
 performance.Managed LoansŠCiticorpThe following tables present a reconciliation between the managed and

Citigroup previously securitized credit card receivables through 
the Broadway Credit Card Trust (Broadway Trust); however, this Trust was 
sold as part of a disposition during 2010.Master Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate term notes as well as 
commercial paper (CP). Some of the term notes are issued to multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits. In 2009, the Master Trust issued $4.3
 billion 
of notes that are eligible for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 

(TALF) program, where investors can borrow from the Federal Reserve using 

the trust securities as collateral. The weighted average maturity of the term 
notes issued by the Master Trust was 3.4 years as of December
 31, 2010 and 
3.6 years as of December 31, 2009. Beginning in 2010, the liabilities of the 
trusts are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Master Trust Liabilities (at par value)In billions of dollarsDecember 31,

$23.5Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. is the sole provider of full liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the Master and Omni Trusts. Both 
of these facilities, which represent contractual obligations on the part of 
Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to provide liquidity for the issued commercial 
paper, are made available on market terms to each of the trusts. The liquidity 

facilities require Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. to purchase the commercial 
paper issued by each trust at maturity, if the commercial paper does not 

roll over, as long as there are available credit enhancements outstanding, 

typically in the form of subordinated notes. As there was no Omni Trust or 

Master Trust commercial paper outstanding as of December
 31, 2010, there 
was no liquidity commitment at that time. The liquidity commitment related 
to the Omni Trust commercial paper programs amounted to $4.4
 billion at 
December 31, 2009. The liquidity commitment related to the Master Trust 

commercial paper program amounted to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2009. 
As of December 31, 2009, none of the Omni Trust or Master Trust liquidity 

commitments were drawn.240In addition, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. had provided liquidity to a third-party, non-consolidated multi-seller commercial paper conduit, which is not a VIE. The commercial paper conduit had acquired notes issued by 
the Omni Trust. The liquidity commitment to the third-party conduit was 
$2.5 billion at December 31, 2009, of which none was drawn.During 2009, all three of Citigroup™s primary credit card securitization 
trustsŠMaster Trust, Omni Trust, and Broadway TrustŠhad bonds placed 

on ratings watch with negative implications by rating agencies. As a result 
of the ratings watch status, certain actions were taken by Citi with respect 
to each of the trusts. In general, the actions subordinated certain senior 
interests in the trust assets that were retained by Citi, which effectively placed 
these interests below investor interests in terms of priority of payment.As a result of these actions, based on the applicable regulatory capital rules, Citigroup began including the sold assets for all three of the credit card 
securitization trusts in its risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating its 
risk-based capital ratios during 2009. The increase in risk-weighted assets 
occurred in the quarter during 2009 in which the respective actions took 
place. The effect of these changes increased Citigroup™s risk-weighted assets 

by approximately $82 billion, and decreased Citigroup™s Tier 1 Capital ratio 

by approximately 100 basis points as of March 31, 2009, with respect to 
each of the master and Omni Trusts. The inclusion of the Broadway Trust 

increased Citigroup™s risk-weighted assets by an additional approximate 

$900 million at June 30, 2009. With the consolidation of the trusts, beginning 
in 2010 the credit card receivables that had previously been considered sold 
under SFAS 140 are now included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 

accordingly these assets continue to be included in Citigroup™s risk-weighted 

assets. All bond ratings for each of the trusts have been affirmed by the rating 
agencies and no downgrades have occurred since December 31, 2010.Mortgage Securitizations
The Company provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to a diverse 
customer base.Once originated, the Company often securitizes these loans through the use of SPEs, which prior to 2010 were QSPEs. These SPEs are funded through 
the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets. These 
certificates have the same average life as the transferred assets. In addition to 
providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these 
assets also reduces the Company™s credit exposure to the borrowers. These 

mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively 
transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities 
issued by the trust. However, the Company™s Consumer business generally 

retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment 
securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future cash flows from 
the trusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of Securities and Banking securitizations. Securities and Banking and Special Asset Pool 
do not retain servicing for their mortgage securitizations.The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally through either a government-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, FNMA or Freddie Mac 

(U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label (non-agency-sponsored 
mortgages) securitization. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of 
its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations, because Citigroup does 
not have the power to direct the activities of the SPE that most significantly 
impact the entity™s economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not 

consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations. In certain 
instances, the Company has (1) the power to direct the activities and (2) the 
obligation to either absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be 
potentially significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitizations 
and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPE.Mortgage SecuritizationsŠCiticorp

agency- and non-agency-sponsored mortgages of $73 million in the year 
ended December 31, 2008.Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization of mortgage receivables for the years ended 
December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:The range in the key assumptions is due to the different characteristics of the interests retained by the Company. The interests retained range 

from highly rated and/or senior in the capital structure to unrated and/or

243Mortgage Servicing RightsIn connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, the Company™s U.S. Consumer mortgage business retains the servicing rights, which entitle 
the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding 
principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to 
service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a 
termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees.The fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) was $4.6 billion and $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $455 billion and 
$555 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following 

table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs for the years ended 
December 31, 2010 and 2009:In millions of dollars2010Balance, beginning of year

658(1,067)(1,567)Balance, end of year

The market for MSRs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants with quoted market prices. Therefore, the Company uses an option-adjusted spread valuation approach to determine the fair value of MSRs. This 
approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest 
rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount 
rates. The key assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include mortgage 
prepayment speeds and discount rates. The model assumptions and the 
MSRs™ fair value estimates are compared to observable trades of similar MSR 
portfolios and interest-only security portfolios, as available, as well as to MSR 
broker valuations and industry surveys. The cash flow model and underlying 
prepayment and interest rate models used to value these MSRs are subject to 
validation in accordance with the Company™s model validation
 policies.The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. In managing 
this risk, the Company economically hedges a significant portion of the 
value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward 
purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased 
securities classified as trading.The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees for the years ended 
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:In millions of dollars2010

securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. 
During the year ended December 31, 2010, Citi transferred non-agency 
(private-label) securities with original loan proceeds of approximately 
$4,868 million to re-securitization entities. These securities are backed by 
either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on 
behalf of clients. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Citi recognized 
losses on the sale of securities to private-label re-securitization entities of 
approximately $119 million. As of December 31, 2010, the market value 
of Citi-owned interests in re-securitization transactions structured by Citi 
totaled approximately $435
 million and are recorded in trading assets. Of this 
amount, approximately $104 million and $331 million relate to senior and 
subordinated beneficial interests, respectively.The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency guaranteed mortgage-backed (Agency) securities. For the year ended December 31, 
2010, Citi transferred agency securities with principal of approximately 
$28,295 million to re-securitization entities. As of December 31, 2010, the 
market value of Citi-owned interests in agency re-securitization transactions 
structured by Citi totaled approximately $351 million and are recorded in 
trading assets.As of December 31, 2010, the Company did not consolidate any private-label or agency re-securitization entities.Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper ConduitsThe Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit 
business as administrator of several multi-seller commercial paper conduits, 
and also as a service provider to single-seller and other commercial paper 
conduits sponsored by third parties.The multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the Company™s clients access to low-cost funding in the commercial paper 

markets. The conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to 
clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. 
The conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by the Company. 

The funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit 
enhancements provided by the Company.
244As administrator to the conduits, the Company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including 
determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, 
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits™ assets, and 
facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the 
Company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions 
and earns an administration fee from the conduit, which is equal to the 
income from client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment 
of interest costs and other fees. This administration fee is fairly stable, since 
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients 
and, once the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs and 
fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit™s
 size.The conduits administered by the Company do not generally invest 
in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The assets 

are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are designed to 

be held by the conduit, rather than actively traded and sold. The yield 

earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the 

commercial paper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk 

to the client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 

transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the third-

party client seller, including over collateralization, cash and excess spread 

collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit 
enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of 
A or above, based on the Company™s internal risk
 ratings.Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper, with a weighted average life generally ranging 

from 30 to 60 days. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the 
weighted average lives of the commercial paper issued by consolidated 
and unconsolidated conduits were approximately 41 days and 43 
days, respectively.
The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit enhancement described above. In 
addition, there are generally two additional forms of credit enhancement 
that protect the commercial paper investors from defaulting assets. First, the 
subordinate loss notes issued by each conduit absorb any credit losses up 
to their full notional amount. Second, each conduit has obtained a letter 
of credit from the Company, which need to be sized to be at least 8Œ10% of 

the conduit™s assets. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the 

consolidated conduits total approximately $2.6 billion. The net result across 
all multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the event 
defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described 
above, any losses in each conduit are allocated in the following order:subordinate loss note holders,the Company, andthe commercial paper investors.The Company also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event 
of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduit is 
supported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset 
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has agreed to 

purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par. Any 

assets purchased under the APA are subject to increased pricing. The APA is 

not designed to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does not 
permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets and generally reprices the 
assets purchased to consider potential increased credit risk. The APA covers 

all assets in the conduits and is considered in the Company™s maximum 

exposure to loss. In addition, the Company provides the conduits with 
program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term lending commitments. 
Under these commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits 
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper market, 
subject to specified conditions. The total notional exposure under the 
program-wide liquidity agreement for the Company™s unconsolidated 

administered conduit as of December 31, 2010, is $0.6 billion and is 
considered in the Company™s maximum exposure to loss. The Company 

receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers 
these fees to be on fair market terms.Finally, the Company is one of several named dealers in the commercial 
paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-based fee for providing 
such services. Along with third-party dealers, the Company makes a market 
in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial 
paper pending sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in 

the market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued 
by conduits administered by the Company, as well as conduits administered 

by third parties. The amount of commercial paper issued by its administered 
conduits held in inventory fluctuates based on market conditions and activity. 

As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned none of the commercial paper 
issued by its unconsolidated administered conduit.Upon adoption of SFAS 167 on January 1, 2010, with the exception 
of the government-guaranteed loan conduit described below, the asset-

backed commercial paper conduits were consolidated by the Company. The 

Company determined that through its role as administrator it had the power 
to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the entities™ economic 
performance. These powers included its ability to structure and approve 
the assets purchased by the conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit 
mitigation activities, and its liability management. In addition, as a result 
of all the Company™s involvement described above, it was concluded that the 

Company had an economic interest that could potentially be significant. 
However, the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart 

from those of Citigroup. No assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the 
creditors of Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries.245The Company administers one conduit that originates loans to third-party borrowers and those obligations are fully guaranteed primarily by AAA-rated government agencies that support export and development financing 
programs. The economic performance of this government-guaranteed loan 
conduit is most significantly impacted by the performance of its underlying 
assets. The guarantors must approve each loan held by the entity and the 
guarantors have the ability (through establishment of the servicing terms 
to direct default mitigation and to purchase defaulted loans) to manage 
the conduit™s loans that become delinquent to improve the economic 

performance of the conduit. Because the Company does not have the power 
to direct the activities of this government-guaranteed loan conduit that most 
significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, it was concluded 

that the Company should not consolidate the entity. As of December
 31, 2010, 
this unconsolidated government-guaranteed loan conduit held assets of 
approximately $9.6 billion.Prior to January 1, 2010, the Company was required to analyze the expected variability of the conduits quantitatively to determine whether the 
Company is the primary beneficiary of the conduit. The Company performed 
this analysis on a quarterly basis. For conduits where the subordinate 
loss notes or third-party guarantees were sufficient to absorb a majority 
of the expected loss of the conduit, the Company did not consolidate. In 
circumstances where the subordinate loss notes or third-party guarantees 
were insufficient to absorb a majority of the expected loss, the Company 
consolidated the conduit as its primary beneficiary due to the additional 
credit enhancement provided by the Company. In conducting this analysis, 

the Company considers three primary sources of variability in the conduit: 
credit risk, interest rate risk and fee variability.
Third-Party Commercial Paper ConduitsThe Company also provides liquidity facilities to single- and multi-seller 
conduits sponsored by third parties. These conduits are independently owned 
and managed and invest in a variety of asset classes, depending on the nature 
of the conduit. The facilities provided by the Company typically represent a 
small portion of the total liquidity facilities obtained by each conduit, and 
are collateralized by the assets of each conduit. As of December 31, 2010, 
the notional amount of these facilities was approximately $965 million, of 
which $415 million was funded under these facilities. The Company is not 
the party that has the power to direct the activities of these conduits that 
most significantly impact their economic performance and thus does not 
consolidate them.Collateralized Debt and Loan Obligations
A securitized collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is an SPE that purchases 
a pool of assets consisting of asset-backed securities and synthetic exposures 
through derivatives on asset-backed securities and issues multiple tranches 
of equity and notes to investors. A third-party asset manager is typically 
retained by the CDO to select the pool of assets and manage those assets over 
the term of the CDO. The Company earns fees for warehousing assets prior 
to the creation of a CDO, structuring CDOs and placing debt securities with 
investors. In addition, the Company has retained interests in many of the 
CDOs it has structured and makes a market in those issued notes.A cash CDO, or arbitrage CDO, is a CDO designed to take advantage of the difference between the yield on a portfolio of selected assets, typically 
residential mortgage-backed securities, and the cost of funding the CDO 
through the sale of notes to investors. ﬁCash flowﬂ CDOs are vehicles in 
which the CDO passes on cash flows from a pool of assets, while ﬁmarket 
valueﬂ CDOs pay to investors the market value of the pool of assets owned 
by the CDO at maturity. Both types of CDOs are typically managed by a 

third-party asset manager. In these transactions, all of the equity and notes 

issued by the CDO are funded, as the cash is needed to purchase the debt 
securities. In a typical cash CDO, a third-party investment manager selects a 
portfolio of assets, which the Company funds through a warehouse financing 
arrangement prior to the creation of the CDO. The Company then sells the 
debt securities to the CDO in exchange for cash raised through the issuance 
of notes. The Company™s continuing involvement in cash CDOs is typically 

limited to investing in a portion of the notes or loans issued by the CDO and 
making a market in those securities, and acting as derivative counterparty for 

interest rate or foreign currency swaps used in the structuring of the CDO.A synthetic CDO is similar to a cash CDO, except that the CDO obtains exposure to all or a portion of the referenced assets synthetically through 
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps. Because the CDO does 
not need to raise cash sufficient to purchase the entire referenced portfolio, a 
substantial portion of the senior tranches of risk is typically passed on to CDO 
investors in the form of unfunded liabilities or derivative instruments. Thus, 
the CDO writes credit protection on select referenced debt securities to the 
Company or third parties and the risk is then passed on to the CDO investors 
in the form of funded notes or purchased credit protection through derivative 
instruments. Any cash raised from investors is invested in a portfolio of 
collateral securities or investment contracts. The collateral is then used to 
support the obligations of the CDO on the credit default swaps written to 
counterparties. The Company™s continuing involvement in synthetic CDOs 

generally includes purchasing credit protection through credit default swaps 
with the CDO, owning a portion of the capital structure of the CDO in the 
form of both unfunded derivative positions (primarily super-senior exposures 

discussed below) and funded notes, entering into interest-rate swap and total-
return swap transactions with the CDO, lending to the CDO, and making a 
market in those funded notes.246A securitized collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is substantially similar to the CDO transactions described above, except that the assets owned by the SPE (either cash instruments or synthetic exposures through derivative 
instruments) are corporate loans and to a lesser extent corporate bonds, 
rather than asset-backed debt securities.Where a CDO vehicle issues preferred shares, the preferred shares generally represent an insufficient amount of equity (less than 10%) and create the 
presumption that the preferred shares are insufficient to finance the entity™s 

activities without subordinated financial support. In addition, although the 
preferred shareholders generally have full exposure to expected losses on the 
collateral and uncapped potential to receive expected residual rewards, it is 
not always clear whether they have the ability to make decisions about the 
entity that have a significant effect on the entity™s financial results because 

of their limited role in making day-to-day decisions and their limited ability 
to remove the third-party asset manager. Because one or both of the above 

conditions will generally be met, we have assumed that, even where a CDO 
vehicle issued preferred shares, the vehicle should be classified as a VIE.Consolidation and Subsequent Deconsolidation of CDOsSubstantially all of the CDOs that the Company is involved with are managed 
by a third-party asset manager. In general, the third-party asset manager, 
through its ability to purchase and sell assets orŠwhere the reinvestment 
period of a CDO has expiredŠthe ability to sell assets, will have the power to 
direct the activities of the vehicle that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the CDO. However, where a CDO has experienced an event of 
default, the activities of the third-party asset manager may be curtailed and 
certain additional rights will generally be provided to the investors in a CDO 
vehicle, including the right to direct the liquidation of the CDO vehicle.The Company has retained significant portions of the ﬁsuper-seniorﬂ 
positions issued by certain CDOs. These positions are referred to as ﬁsuper-

seniorﬂ because they represent the most senior positions in the CDO and, at 
the time of structuring, were senior to tranches rated AAA by independent 
rating agencies. These positions include facilities structured in the form 
of short-term commercial paper, where the Company wrote put options 

(ﬁliquidity putsﬂ) to certain CDOs. Under the terms of the liquidity puts, if 
the CDO was unable to issue commercial paper at a rate below a specified 
maximum (generally LIBOR + 35 bps to LIBOR + 40 bps), the Company 
was obligated to fund the senior tranche of the CDO at a specified interest 
rate. As of December 31, 2010, the Company no longer had exposure to this 
commercial paper as all of the underlying CDOs had been liquidated.Since the inception of many CDO transactions, the subordinate tranches of 
the CDOs have diminished significantly in value and in rating. The declines 

in value of the subordinate tranches and in the super-senior tranches indicate 

that the super-senior tranches are now exposed to a significant portion of the 

expected losses of the CDOs, based on current market assumptions.The Company does not generally have the power to direct the activities of the vehicle that most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
CDOs as this power is held by the third-party asset manager of the CDO. As 
such, certain synthetic and cash CDOs that were consolidated under ASC 810, 
were deconsolidated upon the adoption of SFAS 167. The deconsolidation of 

certain synthetic CDOs resulted in the recognition of current receivables and 
payables related to purchased and written credit default swaps entered into 
by Citigroup with the CDOs, which had previously been eliminated upon 
consolidation of these vehicles.Where (i) an event of default has occurred for a CDO vehicle, (ii) the Company has the unilateral ability to remove the third-party asset manager 
without cause or liquidate the CDO, and (iii) the Company has exposure to 
the vehicle that is potentially significant to the vehicle, the Company will 
consolidate the CDO. In addition, where the Company is the asset manager 
of the CDO vehicle and has exposure to the vehicle that is potentially 
significant, the Company will generally consolidate the CDO.The net impact of adopting SFAS 167 for CDOs was an increase in 
the Company™s assets of $1.9
 billion and liabilities of $1.9 billion as of 
January 1, 2010. The Company continues to monitor its involvement in 
unconsolidated CDOs. If the Company were to acquire additional interests 
in these vehicles, be provided the right to direct the activities of a CDO (if 
the Company obtains the unilateral ability to remove the third-party asset 
manager without cause or liquidate the CDO), or if the CDOs™ contractual 
arrangements were to be changed to reallocate expected losses or residual 
returns among the various interest holders, the Company may be required 
to consolidate the CDOs. For cash CDOs, the net result of such consolidation 
would be to gross up the Company™s balance sheet by the current fair value 

of the subordinate securities held by third parties, whose amounts are not 
considered material. For synthetic CDOs, the net result of such consolidation 
may reduce the Company™s balance sheet by eliminating intercompany 

derivative receivables and payables in consolidation.247Key Assumptions and Retained InterestsŠCiti HoldingsThe key assumptions, used for the securitization of CDOs and CLOs during the year ended December 31, 2010, in measuring the fair value of retained

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) TrustsThe Company sponsors TOB trusts that hold fixed- and floating-rate, 
tax-exempt securities issued by state or local municipalities. The trusts are 
typically single-issuer trusts whose assets are purchased from the Company 
and from the market. The trusts are referred to as Tender Option Bond trusts 
because the senior interest holders have the ability to tender their interests 
periodically back to the issuing trust, as described further below.The TOB trusts fund the purchase of their assets by issuing long-term senior floating rate notes (floaters) and junior residual securities (residuals). 
Floaters and residuals have a tenor equal to the maturity of the trust, which 
is equal to or shorter than the tenor of the underlying municipal bond. 
Residuals are frequently less than 1% of a trust™s total funding and entitle 

their holder to residual cash flows from the issuing trust. Residuals are 
generally rated based on the long-term rating of the underlying municipal 
bond. Floaters bear interest rates that are typically reset weekly to a new 
market rate (based on the SIFMA index: a seven-day high-grade market 
index of tax-exempt, variable-rate municipal bonds). Floater holders have an 
option to tender their floaters back to the trust periodically. Floaters have a 

long-term rating based on the long-term rating of the underlying municipal 
bond, including any credit enhancement provided by monoline insurance 
companies, and a short-term rating based on that of the liquidity provider to 
the trust.248The Company sponsors two kinds of TOB trusts: customer TOB trusts and proprietary TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are trusts through which customers finance investments in municipal securities. Residuals are held 
by customers, and floaters by third-party investors. Proprietary TOB trusts 
are trusts through which the Company finances its own investments in 
municipal securities. The Company holds residuals in proprietary TOB trusts.The Company serves as remarketing agent to the trusts, facilitating the sale of floaters to third parties at inception and facilitating the reset of 
the floater coupon and tenders of floaters. If floaters are tendered and the 
Company (in its role as remarketing agent) is unable to find a new investor 
within a specified period of time, it can declare a failed remarketing (in 
which case the trust is unwound) or it may choose to buy floaters into its own 
inventory and may continue to try to sell them to a third-party investor. While 

the level of the Company™s inventory of floaters fluctuates, the Company 

held none of the floater inventory related to the customer or proprietary TOB 
programs as of December 31, 2010.Approximately $0.6 billion of the municipal bonds owned by TOB trusts have a credit guarantee provided by the Company. In all other cases, the 

assets are either unenhanced or are insured with a monoline insurance 
company. While the trusts have not encountered any adverse credit events 

as defined in the underlying trust agreements, certain monoline insurance 
companies have experienced downgrades. In these cases, the Company has 
proactively managed the TOB programs by applying additional insurance on 
the assets or proceeding with orderly unwinds of the trusts.If a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on 
the underlying municipal bond, the underlying municipal bond is sold 

in the market. If there is an accompanying shortfall in the trust™s cash 

flows to fund the redemption of floaters after the sale of the underlying 

municipal bond, the trust draws on a liquidity agreement in an amount 

equal to the shortfall. Liquidity agreements are generally provided to 

the trust directly by the Company. For customer TOBs where the residual 

is less than 25% of the trust™s capital structure, the Company has a 

reimbursement agreement with the residual holder under which the residual 
holder reimburses the Company for any payment made under the liquidity 
arrangement. Through this reimbursement agreement, the residual holder 
remains economically exposed to fluctuations in the value of the municipal 
bond. These reimbursement agreements are actively margined based on 
changes in the value of the underlying municipal bond to mitigate the 
Company™s counterparty credit risk. In cases where a third party provides 

liquidity to a proprietary TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement is 
made whereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) 
as residual holder absorbs any losses incurred by the liquidity provider. As of 

December 31, 2010, liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer 
TOB trusts, and other non-consolidated, customer-sponsored municipal 

investment funds, totaled $10.1 billion, offset by reimbursement agreements 
in place with a notional amount of $8.6 billion. The remaining exposure 
relates to TOB transactions where the residual owned by the customer is 
at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction and no 
reimbursement agreement is executed. In addition, the Company has 
provided liquidity arrangements with a notional amount of $0.1 billion for 
other unconsolidated proprietary TOB trusts described below.
The Company considers the customer and proprietary TOB trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts were not consolidated by the Company in prior 
periods and remain unconsolidated upon the Company™s adoption of SFAS 

167. Because third-party investors hold residual and floater interests in the 
customer TOB trusts, the Company™s involvement includes only its role as 

remarketing agent and liquidity provider. The Company has concluded 

that the power over customer TOB trusts is primarily held by the customer 
residual holder, who may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust™s bonds. 

Because the Company does not hold the residual interest and thus does not 
have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the 
trust™s economic performance, it does not consolidate the customer TOB 

trusts under SFAS
 167.Proprietary TOB trusts generally were consolidated in prior periods. They remain consolidated upon the Company™s adoption of SFAS 167. The 

Company™s involvement with the Proprietary TOB trusts includes holding the 

residual interests as well as the remarketing and liquidity agreements with 
the trusts. Similar to customer TOB trusts, the Company has concluded that 
the power over the proprietary TOB trusts is primarily held by the residual 
holder, who may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust™s bonds. Because 

the Company holds residual interest and thus has the power to direct the 
activities that most significantly impact the trust™s economic performance, it 

continues to consolidate the proprietary TOB trusts under SFAS
 167.Prior to 2010, certain TOB trusts met the definition of a QSPE and were not consolidated in prior periods. Upon the Company™s adoption of SFAS 

167, former QSPE trusts have been consolidated by the Company as residual 
interest holders and are presented as proprietary TOB trusts.Total assets in proprietary TOB trusts also include $0.5
 billion of assets where residuals are held by hedge funds that are consolidated and 
managed by the Company. The assets and the associated liabilities of these 

TOB trusts are not consolidated by the hedge funds (and, thus, are not 
consolidated by the Company) under the application of ASC 946, Financial ServicesŠInvestment Companies, which precludes consolidation of 
owned investments. The Company consolidates the hedge funds, because 
the Company holds controlling financial interests in the hedge funds. 
Certain of the Company™s equity investments in the hedge funds are hedged 

with derivatives transactions executed by the Company with third parties 
referencing the returns of the hedge fund. The Company™s accounting for 

these hedge funds and their interests in the TOB trusts is unchanged by the 
Company™s adoption of SFAS
 167.249Municipal InvestmentsMunicipal investment transactions are primarily interests in partnerships 
that finance the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing, 
facilitate lending in new or underserved markets, or finance the construction 
or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. The Company 
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the 
investments made by the partnership. These entities are generally considered 
VIEs. The power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the 
general partner. Accordingly, these entities have remained unconsolidated by 
the Company upon adoption of SFAS 167.Client IntermediationClient intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions 
designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of 
an underlying security, referenced asset or index. These transactions include 
credit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the VIE 
typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or 
index through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a 
credit-default swap. In turn the VIE issues notes to investors that pay a return 
based on the specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The VIE 
invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract 
(GIC) that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of 
the transaction. The Company™s involvement in these transactions includes 
being the counterparty to the VIE™s derivative instruments and investing in a 
portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain transactions, the investor™s 
maximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above 
a specified level. The Company does not have the power to direct the activities 
of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and 
thus it does not consolidate them.The Company™s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined 
as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and the notional amount 
of any risk of loss absorbed by the Company through a separate instrument 
issued by the VIE. The derivative instrument held by the Company may 
generate a receivable from the VIE (for example, where the Company 
purchases credit protection from the VIE in connection with the VIE™s 

issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the assets 
owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments are not considered variable 
interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of 
maximum exposure to the VIE.Structured Investment VehiclesStructured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) are SPEs that issue junior notes and 

senior debt (medium-term notes and short-term commercial paper) to fund the 

purchase of high quality assets. The Company acts as manager for the SIVs.In order to complete the wind-down of the SIVs, the Company purchased 
the remaining assets of the SIVs in November 2008. The Company funded the 

purchase of the SIV assets by assuming the obligation to pay amounts due under 

the medium-term notes issued by the SIVs as the medium-term notes mature.Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain investment funds that 
invest in various asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real 
estate, fixed income and infrastructure. The Company earns a management 
fee, which is a percentage of capital under management, and may earn 
performance fees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an 
ownership interest in the investment funds.The Company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments. 
The Company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide 
employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse bases for a 
portion of the employees™ investment commitments.The Company has determined that a majority of the investment vehicles managed by Citigroup are provided a deferral from the requirements of 
SFAS
 167, because they meet the criteria in Accounting Standards Update 
No. 2010-10, Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments for Certain 

Investment Funds (ASU 2010-10) (see Note 1). These vehicles continue 
to be evaluated under the requirements of ASC 810-10, prior to the 
implementation of SFAS 167 (FIN 46(R)).
Where the Company has determined that certain investment vehicles are subject to the consolidation requirements of SFAS 167, the consolidation 

conclusions reached upon initial application of SFAS 167 are consistent 

with the consolidation conclusions reached under the requirements of 
ASC 810-10, prior to the implementation of SFAS
 167.Trust Preferred SecuritiesThe Company has raised financing through the issuance of trust preferred 
securities. In these transactions, the Company forms a statutory business trust 

and owns all of the voting equity shares of the trust. The trust issues preferred 
equity securities to third-party investors and invests the gross proceeds in 
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Company. 
These trusts have no assets, operations, revenues or cash flows other than 
those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the preferred 
equity securities held by third-party investors. These trusts™ obligations are 
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.Because the sole asset of the trust is a receivable from the Company and the proceeds to the Company from the receivable exceed the Company™s 

investment in the VIE™s equity shares, the Company is not permitted to 

consolidate the trusts, even though it owns all of the voting equity shares 
of the trust, has fully guaranteed the trusts™ obligations, and has the right 
to redeem the preferred securities in certain circumstances. The Company 
recognizes the subordinated debentures on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
long-term liabilities.25023. DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIESIn the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. These derivative transactions include:Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a 
contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery.Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years, based on differentials between specified financial indices, as applied to a notional 
principal amount.Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be 
settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices or prices.Citigroup enters into these derivative contracts relating to interest rate, foreign 
currency, commodity, and other market/credit risks for the following
 reasons:Trading PurposesŠCustomer Needs: Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk-management actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and 
other market/credit risks or for their own trading purposes. As part of 
this process, Citigroup considers the customers™ suitability for the risk 
involved and the business purpose for the transaction. Citigroup also 
manages its derivative-risk positions through offsetting trade activities, 
controls focused on price verification, and daily reporting of positions to 
senior managers.Trading PurposesŠOwn Account: Citigroup trades derivatives for its own account and as an active market maker. Trading limits and price verification controls are key aspects of this activity.Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its risk-management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the Company. For example, Citigroup may issue fixed-rate long-term 
debt and then enter into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate 
swap with the same tenor and notional amount to convert the interest 
payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common 
form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes interest cost in certain yield 
curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage risks inherent 
in specific groups of on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities, including 
investments, loans and deposit liabilities, as well as other interest-sensitive 
assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign-exchange contracts are used to 
hedge non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt, foreign-currency-denominated 
available-for-sale securities, net investment exposures and foreign-
exchange transactions.Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market 
risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other factors and is a function 
of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the 
agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss 

in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction where 
the value of any collateral held is not adequate to cover such losses. The 
recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject 
to management™s assessment as to collectability. Liquidity risk is the potential 

exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able 
to be rapidly adjusted in periods of high volatility and financial stress at a 
reasonable cost.Information pertaining to the volume of derivative activity is provided in the tables below. The notional amounts, for both long and short derivative 

positions, of Citigroup™s derivative instruments as of December
 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009 are presented in the table below.

Net receivables/payables








All derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition, where applicable, all such contracts covered by master netting agreements 
are reported net. Gross positive fair values are netted with gross negative fair 
values by counterparty pursuant to a valid master netting agreement. In 
addition, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from 
or paid to a given counterparty are included in this netting. However, non-

cash collateral is not included.The amount of payables in respect of cash collateral received that was netted with unrealized gains from derivatives was $31 billion and $30 billion 
as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The amount of 
receivables in respect of cash collateral paid that was netted with unrealized 
losses from derivatives was $45 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 
$41 billion as of December 31, 2009, respectively.

Accounting for Derivative HedgingCitigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815, 

Derivatives and Hedging (formerly SFAS 133). As a general rule, hedge 

accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, 

such as interest-rate or foreign-exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair 

value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an 

existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings.Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with the changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the risks 
affecting the expected future cash flows are called cash flow hedges. Hedges 
that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange 
risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar functional 
currency foreign subsidiaries (net investment in a foreign operation) are 
called net investment hedges.If certain hedging criteria specified in ASC 815 are met, including testing for hedge effectiveness, special hedge accounting may be applied. The hedge 
effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed 
in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging 
relationships. For fair value hedges, the changes in value of the hedging 
derivative, as well as the changes in value of the related hedged item due to 
the risk being hedged, are reflected in current earnings. For cash flow hedges 
and net investment hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are 

reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Citigroup™s 

stockholders™ equity, to the extent the hedge is effective. Hedge ineffectiveness, 

in either case, is reflected in current earnings.For asset/liability management hedging, the fixed-rate long-term debt may be recorded at amortized cost under current U.S. GAAP. However, by 
electing to use ASC 815 (SFAS 133) hedge accounting, the carrying value 
of the debt is adjusted for changes in the benchmark interest rate, with any 
such changes in value recorded in current earnings. The related interest-rate 
swap is also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with any changes 
in fair value reflected in earnings. Thus, any ineffectiveness resulting from 
the hedging relationship is recorded in current earnings. Alternatively, an 
economic hedge, which does not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria, would 
involve recording only the derivative at fair value on the balance sheet, with 
its associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The debt would 
continue to be carried at amortized cost and, therefore, current earnings 
would be impacted only by the interest rate shifts and other factors that 
cause the change in the swap™s value and the underlying yield of the debt. 
This type of hedge is undertaken when hedging requirements cannot be 
achieved or management decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting. 
Another alternative for the Company would be to elect to carry the debt at 
fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made 
upon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the debt would 
be reported in earnings. The related interest rate swap, with changes in fair 
value, would also be reflected in earnings, and provides a natural offset to the 
debt™s fair value change. To the extent the two offsets are not exactly equal, 
the difference would be reflected in current earnings. This type of economic 
hedge is undertaken when the Company prefers to follow this simpler method 
that achieves generally similar financial statement results to an ASC 815 fair 
value hedge.Key aspects of achieving ASC 815 hedge accounting are documentation of hedging strategy and hedge effectiveness at the hedge inception and 
substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis. A derivative must 
be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either 
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk 
being hedged. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized 
in current earnings. The assessment of effectiveness excludes changes in 
the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged. 
Similarly, the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair 

value of a derivative related to time value that, if excluded, are recognized in 
current earnings.254Fair Value HedgesHedging of benchmark interest rate riskCitigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-
rate issued debt and certificates of deposit. The fixed cash flows from those 
financing transactions are converted to benchmark variable-rate cash flows 
by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Some of these 
fair value hedge relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine 
whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis, while others use regression.Citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets, including available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The hedging 

instruments used are receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Some 
of these fair value hedging relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to 

determine whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception 
and on an ongoing basis, while others use regression analysis.Hedging of foreign exchange riskCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign-exchange 
rate movements in available-for-sale securities that are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the 
securities, which may be within or outside the U.S. The hedging instrument 
employed is a forward foreign-exchange contract. In this type of hedge, the 
change in fair value of the hedged available-for-sale security attributable 
to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in earnings and 
not Accumulated other comprehensive incomeŠa process that serves 
to offset substantially the change in fair value of the forward contract that 
is also reflected in earnings. Citigroup considers the premium associated 
with forward contracts (differential between spot and contractual forward 
rates) as the cost of hedging; this is excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings. The dollar-offset method is used to assess hedge effectiveness. Since that assessment is based on changes 
in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the available-for-
sale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship 
hedged, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Company™s fair 
value hedges for the years ended December

255Cash Flow HedgesHedging of benchmark interest rate riskCitigroup hedges variable cash flows resulting from floating-rate liabilities 
and rollover (re-issuance) of short-term liabilities. Variable cash flows 
from those liabilities are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into 
receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and receive-variable, pay-fixed 
forward-starting interest rate swaps. These cash-flow hedging relationships 
use either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether 
the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing 
basis. Since efforts are made to match the terms of the derivatives to those of 
the hedged forecasted cash flows as closely as possible, the amount of hedge 
ineffectiveness is not significant.Hedging of foreign exchange riskCitigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of long-
term debt and short-term borrowings that are denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the issuing entity. Depending on the 
risk management objectives, these types of hedges are designated as either 
cash flow hedges of only foreign exchange risk or cash flow hedges of both 
foreign exchange and interest rate risk, and the hedging instruments used 
are foreign exchange cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. These 
cash flow hedge relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to determine 
whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis.Hedging total return
Citigroup generally manages the risk associated with highly leveraged 
financing it has entered into by seeking to sell a majority of its exposures 
to the market prior to or shortly after funding. The portion of the highly 
leveraged financing that is retained by Citigroup is hedged with a total 
return swap.The amount of hedge ineffectiveness on the cash flow hedges recognized in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is 
not significant.The pretax change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from cash flow hedges for years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31,

For cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the end-user derivative remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be included in earnings of future 
periods to offset the variability of the hedged cash flows when such cash 
flows affect earnings. The net loss associated with cash flow hedges expected 
to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
within 12 months of December 31, 2010 is approximately $1.5 billion. The 
maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 
10 years.The impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is also shown in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.256Net Investment HedgesConsistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency MattersŠForeign Currency Transactions (formerly SFAS 52, Foreign Currency 
Translation), ASC 815 allows hedging of the foreign currency risk of a 
net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency 
forwards, options, swaps and foreign currency denominated debt instruments 
to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup™s equity 
investments in several non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign 
subsidiaries. Citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these 
investments in the Foreign currency translation adjustment account 
within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Simultaneously, 
the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the 
Foreign currency translation adjustment account and the ineffective 
portion, if any, is immediately recorded in earnings.For derivatives used in net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method from FASB Derivative Implementation Group Issue
 H8 
(now ASC 815-35-35-16 through 35-26), ﬁForeign Currency Hedges: 
Measuring the Amount of Ineffectiveness in a Net Investment Hedge.ﬂ 
According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes 
related to the forward-rate component of the foreign currency forward 
contracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are recorded in the 
foreign currency translation adjustment account within Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss).Foreign currency translation adjustment account. For foreign currency denominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of 
net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in the foreign 
currency translation adjustment account is based on the spot exchange 
rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the 
U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup. To the extent the 

notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged 
net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging 
instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of 
the net investment and Citigroup™s functional currency (or, in the case of 

a non-derivative debt instrument, such instrument is denominated in the 
functional currency of the net investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded 
in earnings.The pretax loss recorded in the Foreign currency translation adjustment account within Accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss), related to the effective portion of the net investment hedges, is 
$3.6 billion and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009, respectively.
Credit DerivativesA credit derivative is a bilateral contract between a buyer and a seller 
under which the seller agrees to provide protection to the buyer against the 
credit risk of a particular entity (ﬁreference entityﬂ or ﬁreference creditﬂ). 
Credit derivatives generally require that the seller of credit protection make 
payments to the buyer upon the occurrence of predefined credit events 
(commonly referred to as ﬁsettlement triggersﬂ). These settlement triggers 
are defined by the form of the derivative and the reference credit and are 
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness 
and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a more limited range of 
transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions referring to 
emerging market reference credits will also typically include additional 
settlement triggers to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of 
repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection 
may be provided on a portfolio of referenced credits or asset-backed securities. 

The seller of such protection may not be required to make payment until a 
specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or 
may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount.The Company makes markets in and trades a range of credit derivatives, both on behalf of clients as well as for its own account. Through these 
contracts, the Company either purchases or writes protection on either a 
single name or a portfolio of reference credits. The Company uses credit 
derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its Corporate and Consumer loan 
portfolios and other cash positions, to take proprietary trading positions, and 
to facilitate client transactions.257The range of credit derivatives sold includes credit default swaps, total return swaps and credit options.A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a credit event on a reference entity. If there is no credit default event or 

settlement trigger, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the 

protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only 
the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs as defined in 

the specific derivative contract sold, the protection seller will be required to 
make a payment to the protection buyer.
A total return swap transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital 
appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate 
of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection 
seller and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated 
with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total 
return swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a 
payment anytime the floating interest rate payment and any depreciation 
of the reference asset exceed the cash flows associated with the underlying 
asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset 
subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between 
the protection seller and the protection buyer.
A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of the reference asset. For example, in a credit 
spread option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell the 

reference asset at a specified ﬁstrikeﬂ spread level. The option purchaser buys 
the right to sell the reference asset to, or purchase it from, the option writer at 
the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread options depend either 
on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive 
asset. The options usually terminate if the underlying assets default.A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note 
writes credit protection to the issuer, and receives a return which will be 

negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference credit. If 
the reference entity defaults, the purchaser of the credit-linked note may 
assume the long position in the debt security and any future cash flows 
from it, but will lose the amount paid to the issuer of the credit-linked note. 
Thus the maximum amount of the exposure is the carrying amount of the 
credit-linked note. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the 
amount of credit-linked notes held by the Company in trading inventory 
was immaterial.The following tables summarize the key characteristics of the Company™s credit derivative portfolio as protection seller as of December 31, 2010 and

258Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives for 
which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the 
underlying referenced credit. Where external ratings by nationally recognized 

statistical rating organizations (such as Moody™s and S&P) are used, investment 

grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB or above, while anything below 

is considered non-investment grade. The Citigroup internal ratings are in 
line with the related external credit rating system. On certain underlying 
reference credits, mainly related to over-the-counter credit derivatives, 

ratings are not available, and these are included in the not-rated category. 

Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-investment grade reference 
credit represent greater payment risk to the Company. The non-investment 

grade category in the table above primarily includes credit derivatives where 
the underlying referenced entity has been downgraded subsequent to the 
inception of the derivative.The maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional 
value of the derivatives. The Company believes that the maximum potential 
amount of future payments for credit protection sold is not representative 
of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This amount 
has not been reduced by the Company™s rights to the underlying assets and 

the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit derivative contracts, 
should a credit event (or settlement trigger) occur, the Company is usually 

liable for the difference between the protection sold and the recourse it holds 
in the value of the underlying assets. Thus, if the reference entity defaults, 
Citi will generally have a right to collect on the underlying reference credit 
and any related cash flows, while being liable for the full notional amount 
of credit protection sold to the buyer. Furthermore, this maximum potential 

amount of future payments for credit protection sold has not been reduced 
for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would 
be calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any credit 
derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master 
netting agreement. Due to such netting processes, determining the amount of 
collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures only is not possible. 
The Company actively monitors open credit risk exposures, and manages 
this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit 
derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This 
risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features in DerivativesCertain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company 
to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding 
liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified credit-risk-related 
event. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, 
are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its 
affiliates. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related 
contingent features that are in a liability position at December 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009 is $25 billion and $17 billion, respectively. The Company 
has posted $18 billion and $11 billion as collateral for this exposure in 
the normal course of business as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 
2009, respectively. Each downgrade would trigger additional collateral 
requirements for the Company and its affiliates. In the event that each legal 
entity was downgraded a single notch as of December 31, 2010, the Company 
would be required to post additional collateral of $2.1 billion.25925. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSFAS 157 (now ASC 820-10) defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements 
about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Among 
other things, the standard requires the Company to maximize the use 
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when 
measuring fair value. In addition, it precludes the use of block discounts 
when measuring the fair value of instruments traded in an active market; 
such discounts were previously applied to large holdings of publicly traded 
equity securities. It also requires recognition of trade-date gains related to 
certain derivative transactions whose fair values have been determined using 
unobservable market inputs.Under SFAS 157
, the probability of default of a counterparty is factored into the valuation of derivative positions, includes the impact of Citigroup™s 

own credit risk on derivatives and other liabilities measured at fair value, and 
also eliminates the portfolio servicing adjustment that is no longer necessary.
Fair Value HierarchyASC 820-10 also specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based 

on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable 

or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from 

independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company™s 

market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following 

fair value hierarchy:Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not 
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and 
significant value drivers are observable in active markets.Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The Company considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the size of the 
bid-ask spread and the amount of adjustment necessary when comparing 
similar transactions are all factors in determining the liquidity of markets 
and the relevance of observed prices in those markets.24. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKConcentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or 
geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate 
credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup™s total credit exposure. 
Although Citigroup™s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified 
along industry, product, and geographic lines, material transactions are 
completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities 
trading, derivatives, and foreign exchange businesses.In connection with the Company™s efforts to maintain a diversified 
portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region, 
country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous 
basis. At December 31, 2010, Citigroup™s most significant concentration of 

credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Company™s 

exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments 
issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $176.4 billion 
and $126.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 

Mexican and Japanese governments and their agencies are the next largest 
exposures, which are rated investment grade by both Moody™s and S&P. The 

Company™s exposure to Mexico amounted to $44.2
 billion and $41.4 billion 
at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is composed of investment 

securities, loans and trading assets. The Company™s exposure to Japan 

amounted to $39.2 billion and $31.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 
2009, respectively, and is composed of investment securities, loans and 

trading assets.260Determination of Fair ValueFor assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures such value using the procedures set out below, irrespective of whether these assets 
and liabilities are carried at fair value as a result of an election or whether 
they were previously carried at fair value.When available, the Company generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. In some cases 
where a market price is available, the Company will make use of acceptable 
practical expedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which 
case the items are classified as Level 2.If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current 
market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest 
rates, currency rates, option volatilities, etc. Items valued using such 
internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the 
lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an 
item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant 
inputs that are readily observable.Where available, the Company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics 
to that being valued. The frequency and size of transactions and the amount 
of the bid-ask spread are among the factors considered in determining the 
liquidity of markets and the relevance of observed prices from those markets. 
If relevant and observable prices are available, those valuations would be 
classified as Level 2. If prices are not available, other valuation techniques 
would be used and the item would be classified as Level 3.Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers. 
Vendors and brokers™ valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging 

from observed prices to proprietary valuation models.The following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure various financial instruments at fair value, 
including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each 
instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate, the description includes 

details of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models and any 
significant assumptions.Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase
No quoted prices exist for such instruments and so fair value is determined 
using a discounted cash-flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based 
on the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded derivative 
or other features. Expected cash flows are discounted using market rates 
appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature and 
amount of collateral taken or received. Generally, such instruments are 
classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the 
fair valuation are readily observable.Trading account assets and liabilitiesŠtrading securities 
and trading loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to determine the 
fair value of trading securities; such items are classified as Level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy. Examples include some government securities and 
exchange-traded equity securities.For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter, the 
Company generally determines fair value utilizing internal valuation 
techniques. Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are 
verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent vendors. 
Vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing 

for similar bonds or loans where no price is observable. If available, the 
Company may also use quoted prices for recent trading activity of assets with 
similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. Trading securities 

and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as Level 2. 
However, when less liquidity exists for a security or loan, a quoted price is 

stale or prices from independent sources vary, a loan or security is generally 

classified as Level 3.Where the Company™s principal market for a portfolio of loans is the 
securitization market, the Company uses the securitization price to determine 
the fair value of the portfolio. The securitization price is determined from 
the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization in the current market, 
adjusted for transformation costs (i.e., direct costs other than transaction 
costs) and securitization uncertainties such as market conditions and 
liquidity. As a result of the severe reduction in the level of activity in 

certain securitization markets since the second half of 2007, observable 
securitization prices for certain directly comparable portfolios of loans have 
not been readily available. Therefore, such portfolios of loans are generally 
classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. However, for other loan 

securitization markets, such as those related to conforming prime fixed-rate 
and conforming adjustable-rate mortgage loans, pricing verification of the 
hypothetical securitizations has been possible, since these markets have 
remained active. Accordingly, these loan portfolios are classified as Level 2 in 

the fair value hierarchy.
261Trading account assets and liabilitiesŠderivativesExchange-traded derivatives are generally fair valued using quoted market 
(i.e., exchange) prices and so are classified as Level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy.The majority of derivatives entered into by the Company are executed over the counter and so are valued using internal valuation techniques as no 
quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The valuation techniques 
and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying 
instrument. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are 
discounted cash flows, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation. The fair 
values of derivative contracts reflect cash the Company has paid or received 
(for example, option premiums paid and received).The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves, foreign-
exchange rates, the spot price of the underlying volatility and correlation. 
The item is placed in either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability 
of the significant inputs to the model. Correlation and items with longer 
tenors are generally less observable.Subprime-related direct exposures in CDOsThe valuation of high-grade and mezzanine asset-backed security (ABS) 
CDO positions uses trader prices based on the underlying assets of each high-
grade and mezzanine ABS CDO. The high-grade and mezzanine positions 
are now largely hedged through the ABX and bond short positions, which are 
trader priced. This results in closer symmetry in the way these long and short 
positions are valued by the Company. Citigroup intends to use trader marks 
to value this portion of the portfolio going forward so long as it remains 
largely hedged.For most of the lending and structuring direct subprime exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available, 
other market data for similar assets in markets that are not active and other 
internal valuation techniques.Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and marketable 
equity securities, whose fair value is determined using the same procedures 
described for trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor prices 
as the primary source.Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities held by the S&B business. Determining the fair 
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management 
resources and judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are 
generally very thinly traded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions 
on private equity securities. The Company uses an established process for 
determining the fair value of such securities, using commonly accepted 
valuation techniques, including the use of earnings multiples based on 
comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based multiples 
and discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of nonpublic 
securities, the Company also considers events such as a proposed sale of 
the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances or other 

observable transactions. As discussed in Note 15, the Company uses NAV to 

value certain of these entities.Private equity securities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debtWhere fair value accounting has been elected, the fair values of 
non-structured liabilities are determined by discounting expected cash 
flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such 
instruments are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as 
all inputs are readily observable.The Company determines the fair values of structured liabilities (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) 
and hybrid financial instruments (performance linked to risks other than 
interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the appropriate derivative 
valuation methodology (described above) given the nature of the embedded 
risk profile. Such instruments are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending 
on the observability of significant inputs to the model.Market valuation adjustmentsLiquidity adjustments are applied to items in Level 2 and Level 3 of the 
fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which 
the entire position could be liquidated in an orderly manner. The liquidity 
reserve is based on the bid-offer spread for an instrument, adjusted to take 
into account the size of the position consistent with what Citi believes a 
market participant would consider.Counterparty credit-risk adjustments are applied to derivatives, such as over-the-counter derivatives, where the base valuation uses market 

parameters based on the LIBOR interest rate curves. Not all counterparties 
have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant LIBOR curve, so it is 
necessary to consider the market view of the credit risk of a counterparty in 
order to estimate the fair value of such an item.262Bilateral or ﬁownﬂ credit-risk adjustments are applied to reflect the Company™s own credit risk when valuing derivatives and liabilities measured 
at fair value. Counterparty and own credit adjustments consider the expected 
future cash flows between Citi and its counterparties under the terms of 
the instrument and the effect of credit risk on the valuation of those cash 
flows, rather than a point-in-time assessment of the current recognized net 
asset or liability. Furthermore, the credit-risk adjustments take into account 

the effect of credit-risk mitigants, such as pledged collateral and any legal 
right of offset (to the extent such offset exists) with a counterparty through 
arrangements such as netting agreements.Auction rate securitiesAuction rate securities (ARS) are long-term municipal bonds, corporate 
bonds, securitizations and preferred stocks with interest rates or dividend 
yields that are reset through periodic auctions. The coupon paid in the 
current period is based on the rate determined by the prior auction. In the 
event of an auction failure, ARS holders receive a ﬁfail rateﬂ coupon, which is 
specified in the original issue documentation of each ARS.Where insufficient orders to purchase all of the ARS issue to be sold in an auction were received, the primary dealer or auction agent would 
traditionally have purchased any residual unsold inventory (without a 
contractual obligation to do so). This residual inventory would then be 
repaid through subsequent auctions, typically in a short time. Due to this 
auction mechanism and generally liquid market, ARS have historically 
traded and were valued as short-term instruments.Citigroup acted in the capacity of primary dealer for approximately $72 billion of ARS and continued to purchase residual unsold inventory 
in support of the auction mechanism until mid-February 2008. After this 
date, liquidity in the ARS market deteriorated significantly, auctions failed 

due to a lack of bids from third-party investors, and Citigroup ceased to 
purchase unsold inventory. Following a number of ARS refinancings, at 

December 31, 2010, Citigroup continued to act in the capacity of primary 
dealer for approximately $23 billion of outstanding ARS.The Company classifies its ARS as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and 
trading securities.Prior to the Company™s first auction™s failing in the first quarter of 2008, 
Citigroup valued ARS based on observation of auction market prices, because 
the auctions had a short maturity period (7, 28 and 35 days). This generally 
resulted in valuations at par. Once the auctions failed, ARS could no longer 

be valued using observation of auction market prices. Accordingly, the fair 

values of ARS are currently estimated using internally developed discounted 
cash flow valuation techniques specific to the nature of the assets underlying 
each ARS.For ARS with U.S. municipal securities as underlying assets, future cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the securities underlying each 
individual ARS and discounted at an estimated discount rate in order to estimate the current fair value. The key assumptions that impact the ARS 
valuations are estimated prepayments and refinancings, estimated fail rate 
coupons (i.e., the rate paid in the event of auction failure, which varies 
according to the current credit rating of the issuer) and the discount rate 
used to calculate the present value of projected cash flows. The discount 
rate used for each ARS is based on rates observed for straight issuances of 
other municipal securities. In order to arrive at the appropriate discount 
rate, these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor in the specifics of 
the ARS structure being valued, such as callability, and the illiquidity in the 

ARS market.For ARS with student loans as underlying assets, future cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the loans underlying each individual ARS, 
discounted at an appropriate rate in order to estimate the current fair value. 
The key assumptions that impact the ARS valuations are the expected 
weighted average life of the structure, estimated fail rate coupons, the 
amount of leverage in each structure and the discount rate used to calculate 
the present value of projected cash flows. The discount rate used for each ARS 
is based on rates observed for basic securitizations with similar maturities 
to the loans underlying each ARS being valued. In order to arrive at the 
appropriate discount rate, these observed rates were adjusted upward to factor 
in the specifics of the ARS structure being valued, such as callability, and the 

illiquidity in the ARS market.During the first quarter of 2008, ARS for which the auctions failed and where no secondary market has developed were moved to Level 3, as the 
assets were subject to valuation using significant unobservable inputs. The 
majority of ARS continue to be classified as Level 3.Alt-A mortgage securitiesThe Company classifies its Alt-A mortgage securities as held-to-maturity, 
available-for-sale and trading investments. The securities classified as 
trading and available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with changes in 
fair value reported in current earnings and AOCI, respectively. For these 
purposes, Citi defines Alt-A mortgage securities as non-agency residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) where (1) the underlying collateral has 
weighted average FICO scores between 680 and 720 or (2)
 for instances where 

FICO scores are greater than 720, RMBS have 30% or less of the underlying 
collateral composed of full documentation loans.Similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans, the Company generally determines the fair values of 
Alt-A mortgage securities utilizing internal valuation techniques. Fair-value 

estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, 
to prices obtained from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from 

various sources. Where available, the Company may also make use of 
quoted prices for recent trading activity in securities with the same or similar 
characteristics to the security being valued.263The internal valuation techniques used for Alt-A mortgage securities, as with other mortgage exposures, consider estimated housing price changes, unemployment rates, interest rates and borrower attributes. They also 
consider prepayment rates as well as other market indicators.Alt-A mortgage securities that are valued using these methods are generally classified as Level 2. However, Alt-A mortgage securities backed by 

Alt-A mortgages of lower quality or more recent vintages are mostly classified 
as Level 3 due to the reduced liquidity that exists for such positions, which 
reduces the reliability of prices available from independent sources.Commercial real estate exposureCitigroup reports a number of different exposures linked to commercial real 
estate at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, including 
securities, loans and investments in entities that hold commercial real estate 
loans or commercial real estate directly. The Company also reports securities 
backed by commercial real estate as available-for-sale investments, which are 

carried at fair value with changes in fair-value reported in AOCI.Similar to the valuation methodologies used for other trading securities and trading loans, the Company generally determines the fair value of 
securities and loans linked to commercial real estate utilizing internal 
valuation techniques. Fair-value estimates from internal valuation 

techniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent 
vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources. Where available, the 

Company may also make use of quoted prices for recent trading activity 
in securities or loans with the same or similar characteristics to that being 
valued. Securities and loans linked to commercial real estate valued using 
these methodologies are generally classified as Level 3 as a result of the 
current reduced liquidity in the market for such exposures.The fair value of investments in entities that hold commercial real estate loans or commercial real estate directly is determined using a similar 
methodology to that used for other non-public investments in real estate 
held by the S&B business. The Company uses an established process for 
determining the fair value of such securities, using commonly accepted 
valuation techniques, including the use of earnings multiples based on 
comparable public securities, industry-specific non-earnings-based multiples 
and discounted cash flow models. In determining the fair value of such 
investments, the Company also considers events, such as a proposed sale 
of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity issuances, or other 

observable transactions. Such investments are generally classified as Level 3 
of the fair value hierarchy.
264Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company™s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company often hedges 
positions that have been classified in the Level 3 category with financial instruments that have been classified as Level 1 or Level 2. In addition, 
the Company also hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with 
instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The effects of 
these hedges are presented gross in the following table.In millions of dollars at December 31, 2010

267Changes in Level 3 Fair Value CategoryThe following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair value category for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company classifies 
financial instruments in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when there is 
reliance on at least one significant unobservable input to the valuation 
model. In addition to these unobservable inputs, the valuation models for 
Level 3 financial instruments typically also rely on a number of inputs that 
are readily observable either directly or indirectly. Thus, the gains and losses 
presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable 
and unobservable inputs.The Company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level. For example, the gains and losses for assets 
and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the tables below do not 
reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that 
have been classified by the Company in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In 
addition, the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with 
instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The effects of 

these hedges are presented gross in the following tables. Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in

The significant changes from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 in Level 3 assets and liabilities are due to:A net decrease in Trading securities of $20.8 billion that was driven by:A net decrease of $10.2 billion in trading mortgage-backed securities  Œdriven mainly by liquidations of subprime securities of $7.5 billion 
and commercial mortgage-backed securities of $1.8 billion;A net increase of $3.6 billion in asset-backed securities including  ŒTransfers to Level 3 of $4.9 billion. Substantially all of these Level 3 transfers related to the reclassification of certain securities to Trading 
under the fair value option upon adoption of ASU 2010-11 on 
July 1, 2010, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. (For purposes of the Level 3 roll-forward table above, 
Level 3 investments that were reclassified to trading upon adoption 
of ASU 2010-11 have been classified as transfers to Level 3 Trading securities); andA decrease of $11.9
 billion in Other debt securities, due primarily to the 
 Œimpact of the consolidation of the credit card securitization trusts by the 
Company upon adoption of SFAS 166/167 on January 1, 2010. Upon 
consolidation of the trusts, the Company recorded the underlying credit 
card receivables on its balance sheet as Loans accounted for at amortized 

cost. At January 1, 2010, the Company™s investments in the trusts and 
other inter-company balances are eliminated. At January 1, 2010, 

the Company™s investment in these newly consolidated VIEs, which is 
eliminated for accounting purposes, included certificates issued by these 
trusts of $11.1 billion that were classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2009. 
The impact of the elimination of these certificates has been reflected as 

net settlements in the Level 3 roll-forward table above.The decrease in Derivatives of $4.5 billion includes net trading losses of $1.5 billion, net settlements of $2.4 billion and net transfers out of Level 3 
to Level 2 of $0.6 billion.The net decrease in Level 3 Investments of $4.1 billion included net sales of asset-backed securities of $2.6 billion and sales of non-marketable equity securities of $1 billion.The net increase in Loans of $3 billion is due largely to the Company™s consolidation of certain VIEs upon the adoption of SFAS 167 on January 1, 2010, for which the fair value option was elected. The impact 
from consolidation of these VIEs on Level 3 loans has been reflected as 
purchases in the Level 3 roll-forward above.The decrease in Mortgage servicing rights of $2 billion is due primarily to 
losses of $1.1 billion, due to a reduction in interest rates.
The decrease in Long-term debt of $1.2 billion is driven mainly by $1.3 billion of net terminations of structured notes.270The significant changes from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 in Level 3 assets and liabilities are due to:A net decrease in trading securities of $10.8 billion that was driven by:Net transfers of $6.5 billion, due mainly to the transfer of debt  Œsecurities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to increased liquidity and 
pricing transparency; andNet settlements of $5.8 billion, due primarily to the liquidations of  Œsubprime securities of $4.1 billion.The change in net trading derivatives driven by:A net loss of $4.9 billion relating to complex derivative contracts,  Œsuch as those linked to credit, equity and commodity exposures. These losses include both realized and unrealized losses during 2009 
and are partially offset by gains recognized in instruments that have 
been classified in Levels 1 and 2; andNet increase in derivative assets of $4.3 billion, which includes cash  Œsettlements of derivative contracts in an unrealized loss position, notably those linked to subprime exposures.The decrease in Level 3 Investments of $6.9 billion primarily resulted from:A reduction of $5.0 billion, due mainly to paydowns on debt  Œsecurities and sales of private equity investments;The net transfer of investment securities from Level 3 to Level 2  Œof $1.5 billion, due to increased availability of observable pricing inputs; andNet losses recognized of $0.4 billion due mainly to losses on non- Œmarketable equity securities including write-downs on private equity investments.The decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $9.1 billion is driven by a $8.6 billion net transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 
as effective maturity dates on structured repos have shortened.The decrease in long-term debt of $1.5 billion is driven mainly by $1.3 billion of net terminations of structured notes.Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the Fair Value HierarchyThe Company did not have any significant transfers of assets or liabilities 
between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during 2010.Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis and therefore are not included in the tables above.These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. In addition, these 
assets include loans held-for-sale that are measured at LOCOM that were 

recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period.The fair value of loans measured on a LOCOM basis is determined where possible using quoted secondary-market prices. Such loans are generally 
classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy given the level of activity in 
the market and the frequency of available quotes. If no such quoted price 
exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar 
asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan.The following table presents all loans held-for-sale that are carried at 
LOCOM as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:In billions of dollarsAggregate costFair value

27126. FAIR VALUE ELECTIONSThe Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes 
in fair value reported in earnings. The election is made upon the acquisition 
of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or 
when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 
may not be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are The following table presents, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of those positions selected for fair value accounting, as well as the changes in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:Fair value at

recorded in current earnings. Additional discussion regarding the applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.All servicing rights must now be recognized initially at fair value. The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage and student 
loan classes of servicing rights. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting 
of MSRs.272Own Credit Valuation AdjustmentThe fair value of debt liabilities for which the fair value option is elected (other than non-recourse and similar liabilities) is impacted by the 
narrowing or widening of the Company™s credit spreads. The estimated 
change in the fair value of these debt liabilities due to such changes in the 
Company™s own credit risk (or instrument-specific credit risk) was a loss 
of $589 million and $4.226 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 
and 2009, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes 
in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the 
Company™s current observable credit spreads into the relevant valuation 
technique used to value each liability as described above.The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesSelected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed, securities sold 
under agreements to repurchase, securities loaned and 
certain non-collateralized short-term borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of 
fixed-income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed-
income securities sold under agreements to repurchase (and certain 
non-collateralized short-term borrowings) on broker-dealer entities in the 
United States, United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest-rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, 
primarily with derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value 
through earnings.Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest revenue and interest expense are 
measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and 
are reported as interest revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.Selected letters of credit and revolving loans hedged by 
credit default swaps or participation notes
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain letters of credit 
that are hedged with derivative instruments or participation notes. Citigroup 
elected the fair value option for these transactions because the risk is 
managed on a fair value basis and mitigates accounting mismatches.The notional amount of these unfunded letters of credit was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. The 
amount funded was insignificant with no amounts 90 days or more past due 
or on non-accrual status at December 31, 2010 and 2009.These items have been classified in Trading account assets
 or Trading 
account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value 
of these items are classified in Principal transactions in the Company™s 

Consolidated Statement of Income.Certain loans and other credit productsCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain originated and 
purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as 
guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup™s trading businesses. 
None of these credit products is a highly leveraged financing commitment. 
Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan 
products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near 
term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative 
instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps 
where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third 
party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting 
mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve 
operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company, including where management objectives 
would not be met.273The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value at December 31, 2010 and 2009:December 31, 2010

Changes in fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in Principal transactions in the Company™s Consolidated 

Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on 
the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue on 
Trading
 account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet 
classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the years 
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to instrument-specific credit risk 
totaled to a loss of $6 million and a gain of $5.9 billion, respectively.
Certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method investments
Citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose 
of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The Company 
has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures, because such 
investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund 
activities in Citi™s investment companies, which are reported at fair value. 
The fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of 
these investments. All investments (debt and equity) in such private equity 
and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are 
classified as Investments on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet.Citigroup also holds various non-strategic investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds for which the Company elected fair 
value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity. Since 

the funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value, the impact 
of applying the equity method to Citigroup™s investment in these funds was 

equivalent to fair value accounting. These investments are classified as 
Other assets on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in Other revenue in the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income.
Certain mortgage loans (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and 
originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage 
loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged 
with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option 
to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is 
complex and to achieve operational simplifications.274The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value at December 31, 2010 and, 2009:In millions of dollarsDecember 31, 2010

1The changes in fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in Other revenue in the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income. The changes 
in fair value during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 due to 
instrument-specific credit risk resulted in a loss of $1 million and $4 million, 
respectively. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the 

contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.Certain consolidated VIEsThe Company has elected the fair value option for all qualified assets 
and liabilities of certain VIEs that were consolidated upon the adoption 
of SFAS 167 on January 1, 2010, including certain private label mortgage 
securitizations, mutual fund deferred sales commissions and collateralized 
loan obligation VIEs. The Company elected the fair value option for these 
VIEs as the Company believes this method better reflects the economic risks, 
since substantially all of the Company™s retained interests in these entities are 
carried at fair value.With respect to the consolidated mortgage VIEs, the Company determined the fair value for the mortgage loans and long-term debt utilizing internal 
valuation techniques. The fair value of the long-term debt measured using 
internal valuation techniques is verified, where possible, to prices obtained 
from independent vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and 

may apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable. 
Security pricing associated with long-term debt that is verified is classified 
as Level 2 and non-verified debt is classified as Level 3. The fair value of 
mortgage loans of each VIE is derived from the security pricing. When 
substantially all of the long-term debt of a VIE is valued using Level 2 inputs, 
the corresponding mortgage loans are classified as Level 2. Otherwise, the 
mortgage loans of a VIE are classified as Level 3.With respect to the consolidated mortgage VIEs for which the fair value option was elected, the mortgage loans are classified as Loans on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The changes in fair value of 

the loans are reported as Other revenue in the Company™s Consolidated 

Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based on the 
contractual interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the Company™s 

Consolidated Statement of Income. Information about these mortgage loans 
is included in the table below. The change in fair value of these loans due to 

instrument-specific credit risk was a gain of $190 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2010.The debt issued by these consolidated VIEs is classified as long-term debt on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The changes in fair value 

for the majority of these liabilities are reported in Other revenue in the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest expense is 

measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. The aggregate unpaid principal balance 
of long-term debt of these consolidated VIEs exceeded the aggregate fair 
value by $857 million as of December 31, 2010.The following table provides information about Corporate and Consumer loans of consolidated VIEs carried at fair value:December 31, 2010

43139Mortgage servicing rights
The Company accounts for mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) at fair value. 
Fair value for MSRs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation 
approach. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under 
multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using 
risk-adjusted rates. The model assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs 
include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates. The fair value of 
MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts 
in mortgage interest rates. In managing this risk, the Company hedges a 
significant portion of the values of its MSRs through the use of interest-rate 
derivative contracts, forward-purchase commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities, and purchased securities classified as trading. See Note 22 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions regarding the 
accounting and reporting of MSRs.These MSRs, which totaled $4.554 billion and $6.530 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are classified as 
Mortgage 
servicing rights on Citigroup™s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair 

value of MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Company™s Consolidated 

Statement of Income.275Certain structured liabilitiesThe Company has elected the fair value option for certain structured 
liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation, 
currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity risks (structured liabilities). 
The Company elected the fair value option, because these exposures are 
considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a 
fair value basis. These positions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits 
or derivatives (Trading account liabilities) on the Company™s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet according to their legal form.The change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in Principal transactions in the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Changes in fair value for structured debt with embedded equity, referenced 

credit or commodity underlyings includes an economic component for 
accrued interest. For structured debt that contains embedded interest rate, 
inflation or currency risks, related interest expense is measured based on the 
contracted interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.Certain non-structured liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-structured 
liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates (non-structured liabilities). 
The Company has elected the fair value option where the interest-rate risk 
of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the 
proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted 
for at fair value through earnings. The election has been made to mitigate 
accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications. These 
positions are reported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company™s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in fair value for 
these non-structured liabilities is reported in Principal transactions in the Company™s Consolidated Statement of Income.Related interest expense continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.In millions of dollarsDecember 31, 2010

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSEstimated Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe table below presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup™s financial instruments. The disclosure excludes leases, affiliate investments, 
pension and benefit obligations and insurance policy claim reserves. 
In addition, contract-holder fund amounts exclude certain insurance 
contracts. Also as required, the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any 
premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time 
the entire holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value associated 
with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be 
incurred in a market transaction. In addition, the table excludes the values 
of non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, 
relationship and intangible values (but includes mortgage servicing rights), 
which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroup™s financial position and 
the value of its net assets.The fair value represents management™s best estimates based on a 
range of methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term 
financial instruments not accounted for at fair value, as well as receivables 
and payables arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair 
value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination 
and expected realization. Quoted market prices are used when available 
for investments and for both trading and end-user derivatives, as well as 
for liabilities, such as long-term debt, with quoted prices. For loans not 
accounted for at fair value, cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary 
market rates or estimated market rates if available. Otherwise, sales of 
comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans 
with similar terms and risk characteristics are used. Expected credit losses 
are either embedded in the estimated future cash flows or incorporated 
as an adjustment to the discount rate used. The value of collateral is also 
considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt not accounted for at fair 
value and without quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest 
are used to discount contractual cash flows.2010In billions of dollars at

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of 

value and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are 
entered into.The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in the case of fixed-rate loans, 
and premium values at origination of certain loans. The carrying values 
(reduced by the Allowance for loan losses) exceeded the estimated fair 
values of Citigroup™s loans, in aggregate, by $21.2
 billion and by $9.7 billion 
in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, the carrying values, net 

of allowances, exceeded the estimated values by $20.0 billion and $1.2 billion 
for Consumer loans and Corporate loans, respectively.
The estimated fair values of the Company™s corporate unfunded lending 
commitments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were liabilities of $5.6 billion 
and $5.0 billion, respectively. The Company does not estimate the fair 

values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally 
cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements.CollateralAt December 31, 2010 and 2009, the approximate market value of collateral 
received by the Company that may be sold or repledged by the Company, 
excluding the impact of allowable netting, was $335.3 billion and 
$346.2 billion, respectively. This collateral was received in connection with 
resale agreements, securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions 
and margined broker loans.At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a substantial portion of the collateral received by the Company had been sold or repledged in connection with 
repurchase agreements, securities sold, not yet purchased, securities 
borrowings and loans, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation 
requirements under securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions 
and bank loans.In addition, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had pledged $246 billion and $253 billion, respectively, of collateral that may not be sold

$7,165GuaranteesThe Company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to Citigroup customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them 
to complete a wide variety of business transactions. For certain contracts 
meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at 
inception, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing 
the guarantee.In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments the guarantor could be required to make under 
the guarantee, if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The 
determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on 
the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible 
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. 
Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on 

these guarantees.The following tables present information about the Company™s guarantees at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009:Maximum potential amount of future paymentsIn billions of dollars at December

Financial standby letters of credit
Citigroup issues standby letters of credit which substitute its own credit 
for that of the borrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is 
obligated to repay Citigroup. Standby letters of credit protect a third party 
from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial standby letters of credit 
include guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks 
that support industrial revenue bond underwriting and settlement of payment 

obligations to clearing houses, and also support options and purchases of 
securities or are in lieu of escrow deposit accounts. Financial standbys also 
backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade acceptances. Performance guaranteesPerformance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a 
customer™s tender bid on a construction or systems-installation project or to 
guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms. 
They are also issued to support a customer™s obligation to supply specified 
products, commodities, or maintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative instruments considered to be guaranteesDerivatives are financial instruments whose cash flows are based on a 
notional amount and an underlying, where there is little or no initial 
investment, and whose terms require or permit net settlement. Derivatives 
may be used for a variety of reasons, including risk management, or to 
enhance returns. Financial institutions often act as intermediaries for their 
clients, helping clients reduce their risks. However, derivatives may also be 
used to take a risk position. The derivative instruments considered to be guarantees, which are presented in the tables above, include only those instruments that require Citi 
to make payments to the counterparty based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security held by 

the guaranteed party. More specifically, derivative instruments considered to 

be guarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options where the 

counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-dealer (such counterparties 

are considered to be dealers in these markets and may, therefore, not hold the 

underlying instruments). However, credit derivatives sold by the Company are 

excluded from this presentation, as they are disclosed separately in Note 23. 
In addition, non-credit derivative contracts that are cash settled and for 
which the Company is unable to assert that it is probable the counterparty 
held the underlying instrument at the inception of the contract also are 
excluded from the disclosure above. In instances where the Company™s maximum potential future payment is 
unlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed. Loans sold with recourseLoans sold with recourse represent the Company™s obligations to reimburse 
the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Recourse refers to the 
clause in a sales agreement under which a lender will fully reimburse the 
buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased loans. This may be 
accomplished by the seller™s taking back any loans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, the repurchase reserve for Consumer mortgages representations and warranties was 
$969 million and $482 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 
2009, respectively, and these amounts are included in 
Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.279The repurchase reserve estimation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. The assumptions used to calculate the repurchase reserve contain a level of uncertainty and risk that, if different from actual 
results, could have a material impact on the reserve amounts.  The key 
assumptions are:loan documentation requests;repurchase claims as a percentage of loan documentation requests;claims appeal success rate; andestimated loss given repurchase or make-whole.For example, Citi estimates that if there were a simultaneous 10% adverse change in each of the significant assumptions, the repurchase reserve would increase by approximately $342 million as of December 31, 2010. This 
potential change is hypothetical and intended to indicate the sensitivity of 
the repurchase reserve to changes in the key assumptions. Actual changes in 
the key assumptions may not occur at the same time or to the same degree 
(i.e., an adverse change in one assumption may be offset by an improvement 
in another). Citi does not believe it has sufficient information to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss (as defined under ASC 450) relating to its 
Consumer representations and warranties.Securities lending indemnificationsOwners of securities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties 
who may sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy some 
other obligation. Banks may administer such securities lending programs for 
their clients. Securities lending indemnifications are issued by the bank to 
guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event 
that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending 
agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of 
the security. Credit card merchant processingCredit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Company™s indirect 

obligations in connection with the processing of private label and bankcard 
transactions on behalf of merchants.Citigroup™s primary credit card business is the issuance of credit cards to 
individuals. In addition, the Company: (a) provides transaction processing 
services to various merchants with respect to its private-label cards and 
(b) has potential liability for transaction processing services provided by a 
third-party related to previously transferred merchant credit card processing 
contracts. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a 
billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately 
resolved in the cardholder‚s favor. The merchant is liable to refund the 

amount to the cardholder. In general, if the credit card processing company 

is unable to collect this amount from the merchant the credit card processing 
company bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to 
the cardholder.
With regard to (a) above, the Company continues to have the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private-label merchants. 
The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the Company and the 
merchant are settled on a net basis and the Company has the right to offset 
any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant. To further 

mitigate this risk the Company may delay settlement, require a merchant 
to make an escrow deposit, include event triggers to provide the Company 
with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial 
deterioration of the merchant, or require various credit enhancements 
(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the unlikely event that 
a private-label merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund to 
its private-label cardholders, the Company is contingently liable to credit or 
refund cardholders. With regard to (b) above, the Company has a potential liability for bankcard transactions with merchants whose contracts were previously 
transferred by the Company to a third-party credit card processor, should that 

processor fail to perform. The Company™s maximum potential contingent liability related to both 
bankcard and private-label merchant processing services is estimated to be 
the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be 
valid chargeback transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be 
$65 billion and $60 billion, respectively.
However, the Company believes that the maximum exposure is not 
representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on the Company™s 

historical experience and its position as a secondary guarantor (in the case 
of previously transferred merchant credit card processing contracts). In 
both cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products 
and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when 
items are returned to merchants. The Company assesses the probability and 
amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on 
the financial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and nature of 

unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 
2010 and December 31, 2009, the estimated losses incurred and the carrying 
amounts of the Company™s contingent obligations related to merchant 

processing activities were immaterial.Custody indemnificationsCustody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will 
be made whole in the event that a third-party subcustodian or depository 
institution fails to safeguard clients™ assets. OtherAs of December 31, 2010, Citigroup carried a reserve of $254 million 
related to certain of Visa USA™s and MasterCard™s litigation matters. As of 
December 31, 2009, the carrying value of the reserve was $121 million and 
was included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 280Other guarantees and indemnificationsCredit Card Protection ProgramsThe Company, through its credit card business, provides various cardholder 
protection programs on several of its card products, including programs 
that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses 
associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases 
and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in 
the table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the 
Company™s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection 
is limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is 
not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits 
at any given time. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its 
potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature 
of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the actual 
and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the Company™s 
obligations related to these programs were immaterial. Other Representation and Warranty IndemnificationIn the normal course of business, the Company provides standard 
representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection 
with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications, including 
indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event 
that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an 
adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions 
provide the Company with comparable indemnifications. While such 
representations, warranties and indemnifications are essential components 
of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying 
business purpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are often 
standard contractual terms related to the Company™s own performance under 
the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business 
based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses 
are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception. No compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties, 
and it is not possible to determine their fair value because they rarely, if 
ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there are no stated or notional 
amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies 
potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and 
are not expected to occur. These indemnifications are not included in the 
tables above.Value-Transfer NetworksThe Company is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer 
networks (VTNs) (payment clearing and settlement systems as well as 
securities exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to backstop the net effect on 
the VTNs of a member™s default on its obligations. The Company™s potential 
obligations as a shareholder or member of VTN associations are excluded 
from the scope of FIN 45, since the shareholders and members represent 
subordinated classes of investors in the VTNs. Accordingly, the Company™s 
participation in VTNs is not reported in the Company™s guarantees tables above and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as of December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009 for potential obligations that 
could arise from the Company™s involvement with VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance IndemnificationIn the sale of an insurance subsidiary, the Company provided an 
indemnification to an insurance company for policyholder claims and 
other liabilities relating to a book of long-term care (LTC) business (for the 
entire term of the LTC policies) that is fully reinsured by another insurance 
company. The reinsurer has funded two trusts with securities whose fair 
value (approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and $3.3 billion at 
December 31, 2009) is designed to cover the insurance company™s statutory 
liabilities for the LTC policies. The assets in these trusts are evaluated and 
adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to 
cover the estimated statutory liabilities related to the LTC policies, as those 
statutory liabilities change over time. If the reinsurer fails to perform under 
the reinsurance agreement for any reason, including insolvency, and the 
assets in the two trusts are insufficient or unavailable to the ceding insurance 
company, then Citigroup must indemnify the ceding insurance company for 
any losses actually incurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both 
events would have to occur before Citi would become responsible for any 
payment to the ceding insurance company pursuant to its indemnification 
obligation and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not 
probable, there is no liability reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

December 31, 2010 related to this indemnification. However, Citi continues to 
closely monitor its potential exposure under this indemnification obligation.Carrying ValueŠGuarantees and IndemnificationsAt December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the total carrying amounts 
of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in 
the tables above amounted to approximately $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, 
respectively. The carrying value of derivative instruments is included in 
either Trading liabilities or Other liabilities, depending upon whether 
the derivative was entered into for trading or non-trading purposes. The 
carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in 
Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the 
liability is included in Other liabilities. In addition, at December 31, 2010 
and December 31, 2009, Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
include an allowance for credit losses of $1,066 million and $1,157 million, 
respectively, relating to letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments. 281CollateralCash collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses realized 
under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $35 billion and 
$31 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. 
Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to 
$41 billion and $43 billion, respectively, the majority of which collateral is 
held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. 
Additionally, letters of credit in favor of the Company held as collateral 
amounted to $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 
December 31, 2009, respectively. Other property may also be available to the 
Company to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; 
however, the value of such property has not been determined. Performance riskCitigroup evaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the 
assigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings. Where external 
ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are considered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is considered non-investment grade. 
The Citigroup internal ratings are in line with the related external rating 
system. On certain underlying referenced credits or entities, ratings are not 
available. Such referenced credits are included in the not rated category. The maximum potential amount of the future payments related to guarantees 
and credit derivatives sold is determined to be the notional amount of these 
contracts, which is the par amount of the assets guaranteed.Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based upon internal and external credit 
ratings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As previously mentioned, the 
determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on 
the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible 
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. 
Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on 

these guarantees. Maximum potential amount of future paymentsIn billions of dollars as of December 31, 2010

$722,012 $222,360$944,372The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require 
payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon 
exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise 

is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period. Commercial and similar letters of creditA commercial letter of credit is an instrument by which Citigroup substitutes 
its credit for that of a customer to enable the customer to finance the 
purchase of goods or to incur other commitments. Citigroup issues a letter 
on behalf of its client to a supplier and agrees to pay the supplier upon 
presentation of documentary evidence that the supplier has performed in 
accordance with the terms of the letter of credit. When a letter of credit is 
drawn, the customer is then required to reimburse Citigroup. One- to four-family residential mortgagesA one- to four-family residential mortgage commitment is a written 
confirmation from Citigroup to a seller of a property that the bank will 
advance the specified sums enabling the buyer to complete the purchase. Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties
Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential 
properties are essentially home equity lines of credit. A home equity line of 
credit is a loan secured by a primary residence or second home to the extent 
of the excess of fair market value over the debt outstanding for the first 
mortgage. Commercial real estate, construction and land 
development
Commercial real estate, construction and land development include 
unused portions of commitments to extend credit for the purpose of 
financing commercial and multifamily residential properties as well as land 
development projects. Both secured-by-real-estate and unsecured commitments are included in this line, as well as undistributed loan proceeds, where there is an obligation 
to advance for construction progress payments. However, this line only 

includes those extensions of credit that, once funded, will be classified as 
Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit card linesCitigroup provides credit to customers by issuing credit cards. The credit card 
lines are unconditionally cancelable by the issuer. Commercial and other Consumer loan commitmentsCommercial and other Consumer loan commitments include overdraft and 
liquidity facilities, as well as commercial commitments to make or purchase 
loans, to purchase third-party receivables, to provide note issuance or 
revolving underwriting facilities and to invest in the form of equity. Amounts 
include $79 billion and $126 billion with an original maturity of less than 
one year at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. In addition, included in this line item are highly leveraged financing commitments, which are agreements that provide funding to a borrower with 
higher levels of debt (measured by the ratio of debt capital to equity capital 
of the borrower) than is generally considered normal for other companies. 
This type of financing is commonly employed in corporate acquisitions, 
management buy-outs and similar transactions. 28329. CONTINGENCIES OverviewIn addition to the matters described below, in the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, 
directors and employees (for purposes of this section, sometimes collectively 
referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties) routinely are named as 
defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings. Certain 
of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek relief in connection 
with alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, banking, 
antifraud, antitrust, anti-money laundering, employment and other statutory 
and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal actions and 
proceedings include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or 
punitive damages, or for injunctive relief.In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and Related Parties also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-
gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and 
informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, 
fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Certain affiliates and subsidiaries 
of Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers, futures commission 

merchants, investment advisers or other regulated entities and, in those 
capacities, are subject to regulation by various U.S., state and foreign 
securities, banking, commodity futures and other regulators. In connection 
with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, Citigroup and such 
affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders 
seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with 
various aspects of their regulated activities. Because of the global scope of Citigroup™s operations, and its presence 
in countries around the world, Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to 
litigation, and governmental and regulatory examinations, information-
gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and 
informal), in multiple jurisdictions with legal and regulatory regimes that 
may differ substantially, and present substantially different risks, from those 

Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United States. Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation and regulatory matters in the manner management believes is in the best interests of Citigroup and its 
shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of wrongdoing and, where 

applicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or other relief 
sought as appropriate in each pending matter.
Accounting and Disclosure FrameworkASC 450 (formerly SFAS 5) governs the disclosure and recognition of loss 
contingencies, including potential losses from litigation and regulatory 
matters. ASC 450 defines a ﬁloss contingencyﬂ as ﬁan existing condition, 
situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss 
to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events 
occur or fail to occur.ﬂ It imposes different requirements for the recognition 
and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the likelihood of occurrence 
of the contingent future event or events. It distinguishes among degrees of 
likelihood using the following three terms: ﬁprobable,ﬂ meaning that ﬁthe 
future event or events are likely to occurﬂ; ﬁremote,ﬂ meaning that ﬁthe 
chance of the future event or events occurring is slightﬂ; and ﬁreasonably 
possible,ﬂ meaning that ﬁthe chance of the future event or events occurring 
is more than remote but less than likely.ﬂ These three terms are used below 
as defined in ASC 450.Accruals. ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency when it is ﬁprobable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact 
of lossﬂ and ﬁthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.ﬂ In 
accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for all litigation 
and regulatory matters, including matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup 
believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the 
loss can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is 
within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued, 
unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than any 
other amount within the range. Once established, accruals are adjusted from 
time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount 
of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially 
higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. Disclosure. ASC 450 requires disclosure of a loss contingency if ﬁthere is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have 
been incurredﬂ and there is no accrual for the loss because the conditions 
described above are not met or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the 
amount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued 
for a matter because Citigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible 
but not probable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably estimable, 
and the matter therefore does not meet the criteria for accrual, it discloses 
the loss contingency. In addition, Citigroup discloses matters for which it 

has accrued if it believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount 
accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup™s disclosure includes an 

estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for those matters as 
to which an estimate can be made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an 
estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate 
cannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for losses that are 
deemed remote.Inherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the matters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or indeterminate damages. 
The claims asserted in these matters typically are broad, often spanning a 
multi-year period and sometimes a wide range of business activities, and 
the plaintiffs™ or claimants™ alleged damages frequently are not quantified 
or factually supported in the complaint or statement of claim. As a result, 
Citigroup is often unable to estimate the loss in such matters, even if it 
believes that a loss is probable or reasonably possible, until developments 
in the case have yielded additional information sufficient to support a 
quantitative assessment of the range of reasonably possible loss. Such 
developments may include, among other things, discovery from adverse 
parties or third parties, rulings by the court on key issues, analysis by 
retained experts, and engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending 
on a range of factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of the 
legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court™s scheduling order, the timing 

of court decisions, and the adverse party™s willingness to negotiate in good 

faith towards a resolution, it may be months or years after the filing of a case 
before an estimate of the range of reasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made. For some of the matters disclosed below, Citigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible 

loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For some of the 284matters included within this estimation, an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable, but an 
exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued; in these cases, 
the estimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of the 
accrued amount. For other matters included within this estimation, no 
accrual has been made because a loss, although estimable, is believed to be 
reasonably possible, but not probable; in these cases the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued 
for these matters in the aggregate ranges up to approximately $4 billion in 
future periods.These estimates are based on currently available information. As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will 
change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many 
estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosure 
involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, 

estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation and 
regulatory proceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, 
at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may have only preliminary, 
incomplete, or inaccurate information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal 
on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties or 
regulators, may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to 
predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative 
analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that 
Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such 
an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess 
of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters as to which an estimate has 
been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss 
included in the estimate. Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made. For other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able to estimate the reasonably 

possible loss or range of loss. Many of these matters remain in very 
preliminary stages (even in some cases where a substantial period of time has 

passed since the commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive 
legal decisions by the court or tribunal defining the scope of the claims, the 
class (if any), or the potentially available damages, and fact discovery is still 
in progress or has not yet begun. In many of these matters, Citigroup has 
not yet answered the complaint or statement of claim or asserted its defenses, 
nor has it engaged in any negotiations with the adverse party (whether 
a regulator or a private party). For all these reasons, Citigroup cannot at 
this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, for 

these matters.Opinion of Management as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup™s management, based on current 

knowledge and after taking into account its current legal accruals, that the 
eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely 
to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition 
of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts 
sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such 
matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time 
to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup™s consolidated results of 

operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.Credit-Crisis-Related Litigation and Other MattersCitigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in numerous 
legal actions and other proceedings asserting claims for damages and related 
relief for losses arising from the global financial credit and subprime-
mortgage crisis that began in 2007. Such matters include, among other 
types of proceedings, claims asserted by: (i) individual investors and 
purported classes of investors in Citigroup™s common and preferred stock 
and debt, alleging violations of the federal securities laws; (ii) participants 
and purported classes of participants in Citigroup™s retirement plans, 
alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA); (iii) counterparties to significant transactions adversely affected by 
developments in the credit and subprime markets; (iv) individual investors 
and purported classes of investors in securities and other investments 
underwritten, issued or marketed by Citigroup, including collateralized 
debt obligations (CDOs), mortgage-backed securities (MBS), auction-
rate securities (ARS), investment funds, and other structured or leveraged 
instruments, that have suffered losses as a result of the credit crisis; and  (v) individual borrowers asserting claims related to their loans. These 
matters have been filed in state and federal courts across the country, as well 
as in arbitrations before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) 
and other arbitration associations. In addition to these litigations and arbitrations, Citigroup continues to cooperate fully in response to subpoenas and requests for information 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), FINRA, the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency, state attorneys general, the Department of Justice 

and subdivisions thereof, bank regulators, and other government agencies 
and authorities, in connection with various formal and informal inquiries 
concerning Citigroup™s subprime and other mortgage-related conduct and 

business activities, as well as other business activities affected by the credit 
crisis. These business activities include, but are not limited to, Citigroup™s 

sponsorship, packaging, issuance, marketing, servicing and underwriting 
of MBS and CDOs and its origination, sale or other transfer, servicing, and 

foreclosure of residential mortgages. Subprime Mortgage-Related Litigation and Other Matters Beginning in November 2007, Citigroup and Related Parties have been 
named as defendants in numerous legal actions and other proceedings 
brought by Citigroup shareholders, investors, counterparties and others 
concerning Citigroup™s activities relating to subprime mortgages, including 
Citigroup™s involvement with CDOs, MBS and structured investment vehicles, 
Citigroup™s underwriting activity for subprime mortgage lenders, and 
Citigroup™s more general subprime- and credit-related activities.Regulatory Actions: The SEC, among other regulators, is investigating Citigroup™s subprime and other mortgage-related conduct and business 

activities, as well as other business activities affected by the credit crisis, 
including an ongoing inquiry into Citigroup™s structuring and sale of CDOs. 

Citigroup is cooperating fully with the SEC™s inquiries. 
On July 29, 2010, the SEC announced the settlement of an investigation into certain of Citigroup™s 2007 disclosures concerning its subprime-related 

business activities. On October 19, 2010, the United States District Court for 
the District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment approving the settlement, 285pursuant to which Citigroup agreed to pay a $75 million civil penalty and to maintain certain disclosure policies, practices and procedures for a three-year 

period. Additional information relating to this action is publicly available in 
court filings under the docket number 10 Civ. 1277 (D.D.C.) (Huvelle, J.). 
The Federal Reserve Bank, the OCC and the FDIC, among other federal and state authorities, are investigating issues related to the conduct of certain 
mortgage servicing companies, including Citigroup affiliates, in connection 
with mortgage foreclosures. Citigroup is cooperating fully with these 
inquiries. Securities Actions: Citigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in four putative class actions filed in the Southern District of 
New York. These actions allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of 

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On August 19, 2008, these actions 
were consolidated under the caption IN RE CITIGROUP INC. SECURITIES 
LITIGATION. In this action, lead plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of 

a putative class of purchasers of Citigroup stock from January 1, 2004 
through January 15, 2009. On November 9, 2010, the district court issued 
an order and opinion granting in part and denying in part defendants™ 
motion to dismiss the amended consolidated class action complaint. The court dismissed all claims except those arising out of Citigroup™s exposure 

to CDOs for the time period February 1, 2007 through April 18, 2008. Fact 
discovery has begun. A class certification motion has not yet been filed, and 
plaintiffs have not yet quantified the putative class™s alleged damages. During 

the putative class period, as narrowed by the court, the price of Citigroup™s 

common stock declined from $54.73 at the beginning of the period to $25.11 
at the end of the period. Additional information relating to this action is 
publicly available in court filings under the consolidated lead docket number 
07 Civ. 9901 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.).
Citigroup and Related Parties also have been named as defendants in two putative class actions filed in New York state court, but since removed to the 

Southern District of New York. These actions allege violations of Sections 

11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, arising out of various offerings 
of Citigroup notes during 2006, 2007 and 2008. On December 10, 2008, 
these actions were consolidated under the caption IN RE CITIGROUP INC. 
BOND LITIGATION. In the consolidated action, lead plaintiffs assert claims 

on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of 48 corporate debt securities, 
preferred stock, and interests in preferred stock issued by Citigroup and 
related issuers over a two-year period from 2006 to 2008. On July 12, 2010, 
the district court issued an order and opinion granting in part and denying in 

part defendants™ motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint. 
The court, among other things, dismissed plaintiffs™ claims under Section 12 
of the Securities Act of 1933, but denied defendants™ motion to dismiss certain 
claims under Section 11 of that Act. A motion for partial reconsideration of 
the latter ruling is pending. Fact discovery has begun. A class certification 
motion has not yet been filed, and plaintiffs have not yet quantified the 
putative class™s alleged damages. Additional information relating to this 

action is publicly available in court filings under the consolidated lead 
docket number 08 Civ. 9522 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.).
Several institutions and sophisticated investors that purchased debt and equity securities issued by Citigroup and related issuers have also filed actions 
on their own behalf against Citigroup and Related Parties in the Southern 
District of New York and the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia 
County. These actions assert claims similar to those asserted in the IN RE 

CITIGROUP INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION and IN RE CITIGROUP INC. 

BOND LITIGATION actions described above. Collectively, these investors 

seek damages exceeding $1 billion. Additional information relating to 
these individual actions is publicly available in court filings under the 
docket numbers 09 Civ. 8755 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.), 10, Civ. 7202 (S.D.N.Y.) 

(Stein, J.), 10 Civ. 9325 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.), 10 Civ. 9646 (S.D.N.Y.) 

(Stein, J.), 11 Civ. 314 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.), and Case No. 110105028 

(Pa. Commw. Ct.) (Sheppard, J.).
ERISA Actions: Numerous class actions were filed in the Southern District of New York asserting claims under ERISA against Citigroup and certain 

Citigroup employees alleged to have served as ERISA plan fiduciaries. 
On August 31, 2009, the court granted defendants™ motion to dismiss the 
consolidated class action complaint, captioned IN RE CITIGROUP ERISA 
LITIGATION. Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal, and the appeal is fully 

briefed and argued. Additional information relating to this action is publicly 
available in court filings under the consolidated lead docket number 07 Civ. 

9790 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.) and under GRAY v. CITIGROUP INC., 09-3804 

(2d Cir.). 
Derivative Actions and Related Proceedings: Numerous derivative actions have been filed in federal and state courts against various current 
and former officers and directors of Citigroup, alleging mismanagement in 
connection with the financial credit and subprime mortgage crisis. Citigroup 
is named as a nominal defendant in these actions. Certain of these actions 
have been dismissed either in their entirety or in large part. Additional 
information relating to these actions is publicly available under the index 
number 650417/09 (N.Y. Super. Ct.) (Fried, J.), the consolidated lead docket 

number 07 Civ. 9841 (S.D.N.Y.) (Stein, J.), and the consolidated civil action 

number 3338-CC (Del. Ch.) (Chandler, C.).
Underwriting Matters: Certain Citigroup affiliates and subsidiaries have been named as defendants arising out of their activities as underwriters of 
securities in actions brought by investors in securities of issuers adversely 
affected by the credit crisis, including AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ambac 
and Lehman, among many others. These matters are in various stages of 
litigation. As a general matter, issuers indemnify underwriters in connection 

with such claims. In certain of these matters, however, Citigroup is not being 

indemnified or may in the future cease to be indemnified because of the 
financial condition of the issuer.
On December 3, 2010, plaintiffs and the underwriter defendants, including Citigroup, in IN RE AMBAC FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION
, 08 Civ. 0411 (S.D.N.Y.), entered into a memorandum of 

understanding settling all claims against Citigroup subject to the entry of a 
final stipulation of settlement and court approval.Subprime Counterparty and Investor Actions: Citigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in actions brought in various state 
and federal courts, as well as in arbitrations, by counterparties and investors 
that have suffered losses as a result of the credit crisis. These actions include 
an arbitration brought by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alleging 

statutory and common law claims in connection with its $7.5 billion 
investment in Citigroup. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority alleges losses 
of $4 billion. Pre-hearing proceedings in this matter are ongoing. The 
arbitration hearing has been scheduled for May 2011.286In addition, beginning in July 2010, several investors, including Cambridge 
Place Investment Management, The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Federal 
Home Loan Bank of Chicago, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, and Allstate Insurance Company and affiliated entities, have filed lawsuits 

against Citigroup and certain of its affiliates alleging actionable misstatements 

or omissions in connection with the issuance and underwriting of residential 

MBS. As a general matter, plaintiffs in these actions are seeking rescission of their 

investments or other damages. Additional information relating to these actions 

is publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 10 Civ. 11376 

(D. Mass.) (Gorton, J.), 10 Civ. 04030 (N.D. Cal.) (Illston, J.), 10-CH-45033 

(Ill. Cir. Ct.), 10 Civ. 09105 (C.D. Cal.) (Pfaelzer, J.), 10 Civ. 01463 (S.D. Ind.) 

(Lawrence, J.), 11-0555 (Mass. Super. Ct.)
 and 650432/2011 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.).
Separately, at various times, parties to RMBS securitizations, among 
others, have asserted that certain Citigroup affiliates breached representations 
and warranties made in connection with mortgage loans placed into 
securitization trusts and have sought repurchase of the affected mortgage 
loans or indemnification from resulting losses, among other remedies. 
The frequency of such demands may increase in the future, and some such 
demands may result in litigation. ASTA/MAT and Falcon-Related Litigation and Other MattersASTA/MAT and Falcon were hedge funds managed and marketed by 
Citigroup that performed well for many years but suffered substantial losses 
during the credit crisis. The SEC is investigating the marketing, management 
and accounting treatment of the Falcon and ASTA/MAT funds. Citigroup is 
cooperating fully with the SEC™s inquiry. In addition, several investors in Falcon and ASTA/MAT have filed lawsuits 
or arbitrations against Citigroup and Related Parties seeking recoupment of 
their alleged losses. Many of these investor disputes have been resolved, and 
the remainder are in various procedural stages. Auction Rate SecuritiesŠRelated Litigation and Other Matters 
Beginning in March 2008, Citigroup and Related Parties have been named 
as defendants in numerous actions and proceedings brought by Citigroup 
shareholders and customers concerning ARS. These have included, among 
others: (i) numerous arbitrations filed by customers of Citigroup and its 
subsidiaries seeking damages in connection with investments in ARS, which 
are in various procedural stages; (ii) a consolidated putative class action 
asserting claims for federal securities and other statutory and common law 
violations, in which a motion to dismiss is pending; (iii) two putative class 
actions asserting violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which have been 
dismissed and are now pending on appeal; and (iv) a derivative action filed 
against certain Citigroup officers and directors, which has been dismissed. Lehman Structured Notes Matters Like many other financial institutions, Citigroup, through certain of its 
affiliates and subsidiaries, distributed structured notes (Notes) issued and 
guaranteed by Lehman entities to retail customers in various countries 
outside the United States, principally in Europe and Asia. After the relevant 
Lehman entities filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2008, certain 
regulators in Europe and Asia commenced investigations into the conduct of financial institutions involved in such distribution, including Citigroup 
entities. Some of those regulatory investigations have resulted in adverse 
findings against Citigroup entities. Some purchasers of the Notes have filed 
civil actions or otherwise complained about the sales process. Citigroup has 
dealt with a number of such complaints and claims on an individual basis 
based on the particular circumstances. In Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Spain, Poland and Turkey, Citigroup 
made a settlement offer to all eligible purchasers of Notes distributed by 
Citigroup in those countries. A significant majority of the eligible purchasers 
accepted Citigroup™s settlement offer, made without admission of liability, 

in full and final settlement of all potential claims. A limited number of 
eligible purchasers declined to settle and are pursuing civil lawsuits. The 
approximate aggregate par value of Notes that are the subject of these suits is 
less than $10 million.Criminal investigations are open in Greece. In Belgium, criminal charges were brought against a Citigroup subsidiary (CBB) and three current or 
former employees. The Public Prosecutor had asked the criminal court to 
impose on CBB a fine of 660,000 Euro and a confiscation order of up to 
131,476,097.90 Euro, and to sanction the three individual employees. On 
December 1, 2010, all defendants were cleared of fraud and anti-money 
laundering charges and the related confiscation requests. The court also 
rejected certain other charges but convicted all defendants under the 
Prospectus Act, and convicted CBB under Fair Trade Practices legislation. 

CBB was fined 165,000 Euro, and each individual defendant was fined 
427.50 Euro. Sixty-three non-settling civil claimants had made civil claims 
in the criminal proceedings with respect to Notes with an aggregate par 
value of approximately 2.4 million Euro. Citi was ordered to compensate all 
63 claimants for the full par value of their Notes, less the value ultimately 
received for their Notes in the Lehman bankruptcies. CBB has appealed 
the judgment.In Hong Kong, regulators have conducted investigations of banks that distributed Notes, including a Citigroup subsidiary (CHKL). With respect 
to certain other banks, the regulators have completed their investigation 
and required these banks to compensate some purchasers of Notes for all 
or a portion of their losses. The regulators have not yet concluded their 
investigation of CHKL. The total subscription amount of the Notes CHKL 
distributed in Hong Kong is approximately $200 million.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy ProceedingsCitigroup and Related Parties may face claims in the liquidation proceeding 
of Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI), the broker-dealer subsidiary of Lehman 
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI), pending before the United States Bankruptcy 
Court for the Southern District of New York under the Securities Investor 
Protection Act (SIPA). The SIPA Trustee has advised Citigroup and Related 
Parties that the Trustee may seek to recover a $1 billion setoff that Citibank, 
N.A. took with respect to certain clearing obligations of LBI. In addition, 
LBHI or its subsidiaries may assert bankruptcy avoidance and other claims 
against Citigroup and Related Parties in their Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings, including, among others, claims seeking the return of a 
$2 billion deposit LBHI made with Citibank in June 2008, prior to LBHI™s 
collapse. Citibank believes that it has the right to set off against this deposit 
claims it has against LBHI arising under derivatives contracts and loan 
documents. Additional information relating to the liquidation proceeding 
of LBI, captioned IN RE LEHMAN BROTHERS INC., is publicly available in 287court filings under docket number 08-01420 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (Peck, J.). Additional information relating to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of 
LBHI and its subsidiaries, captioned IN RE LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS 
INC., is publicly available in court filings under docket number 08-13555 
(Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) (Peck, J.).Citigroup and Related Parties also hold as custodians approximately $2 billion of proprietary assets and cash of LBHI subsidiary Lehman Brothers 
International (Europe) (LBIE), currently in insolvency administration in the 
United Kingdom. Citigroup and Related Parties have asserted a contractual 
right to retain the proprietary assets and cash as security for amounts owed 
to Citigroup and Related Parties by LBIE and its affiliates (including LBHI 
and LBI), which the administrators for LBIE have disputed. Additional 
information relating to the U.K. administration of LBIE is available at 
www.pwc.co.uk/eng/issues/lehman_updates.html
.Terra Firma LitigationPlaintiffs, general partners of two related private equity funds, filed a 
complaint in New York state court (later removed to the Southern District 
of New York) against certain Citigroup entities in December 2009, alleging 
that during the May 2007 auction of the music company EMI, Citigroup, 
as advisor to EMI and as a potential lender to plaintiffs™ acquisition vehicle 
Maltby, fraudulently or negligently orally misrepresented the intentions 
of another potential bidder regarding the auction. Plaintiffs alleged that, 
but for the oral misrepresentations, Maltby would not have acquired EMI 
for approximately 4.2 billion British pounds. Plaintiffs further alleged 
that, following the acquisition of EMI, certain Citigroup entities tortiously 
interfered with plaintiffs™ business relationship with EMI. Plaintiffs sought 
billions of dollars in damages. On September 15, 2010, the district court 
issued an order granting in part and denying in part Citigroup™s motion 
for summary judgment. Plaintiffs™ claims for negligent misrepresentation 
and tortious interference were dismissed. On October 18, 2010, a jury trial 
commenced on plaintiffs™ remaining claims for fraudulent misrepresentation 
and fraudulent concealment. The court dismissed the fraudulent 
concealment claim before sending the case to the jury. On November 4, 
2010, the jury returned a verdict on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim 
in favor of Citigroup. Judgment dismissing the complaint was entered 
on December 9, 2010. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. Additional 
information regarding the action is publicly available in court filings under 
docket number 09 Civ. 10459 (S.D.N.Y.) (Rakoff, J.).KIKOsSeveral local banks in Korea, including a Citigroup subsidiary (CKI), entered 
into foreign exchange derivative transactions with small and medium-
size export businesses (SMEs) to enable the SMEs to hedge their currency 
risk. The derivatives had ﬁknock-in, knock-outﬂ features. Following the 
devaluation of the Korean won in 2008, many of these SMEs incurred 
significant losses on the derivative transactions and filed civil lawsuits 
against the banks, including CKI.  The claims generally allege that the 
products were not suitable and the risk disclosure was inadequate. As of 
December 31, 2010, 80 civil claims had been made by SMEs against CKI. To 
date, 55 decisions have been rendered at the district court level, and CKI has prevailed in 47 of those decisions. In the other eight decisions, the plaintiff 
was awarded only a portion of the damages it sought. Damage awards to date 
total in the aggregate approximately $6 million. CKI intends to appeal the 
eight adverse decisions. CKI also expects a significant number of plaintiffs 
to appeal decisions rendered against them, including plaintiffs that were 
awarded less than all of the damages they sought.The Korean prosecutors have also undertaken a criminal investigation of the local banks, including CKI, based on allegations of fraud in the sale of 
these products.  This investigation is ongoing.  The local banking regulator 
also undertook an investigation of the local banks regarding the sale of these 
products. This investigation resulted in disciplinary recommendations by the 
local banking regulator with respect to certain CKI employees, but CKI itself 
was not sanctioned. Tribune Company BankruptcyCertain Citigroup entities have been named as defendants in adversary 
proceedings related to the Chapter 11 cases of Tribune Company (Tribune) 
pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The 
complaints set forth allegations arising out of the approximate $11 billion 
leveraged buyout (LBO) of Tribune in 2007. With respect to Citigroup, the 
complaints allege claims relating to Citigroup™s role as lender and advisor to 
Tribune in connection with the LBO and seek to avoid, recover, subordinate 
or disallow payments on LBO debt, as well as approximately $57 million 
in lender and advisory fees received by Citigroup and Related Parties in 
connection with the LBO. The complaints also assert claims of aiding and 
abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by Tribune management as well as 
professional malpractice. The complaints have been stayed by court order 
pending a confirmation hearing on competing plans of reorganization.  If 
confirmed, the plan proposed by the Debtors and others, and supported by 
Citigroup, would settle all claims relating to Citigroup™s role as lender. On 
February 11, 2011, Tribune and its debtor subsidiaries announced that most 
classes of voting creditors overwhelmingly approved the Debtors™ plan. The 
Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a confirmation hearing for March 7, 2011. 
Additional information relating to these actions is publicly available in court 
filings under the docket number 08-13141 (Bankr. D. Del.) (Carey, J.).Interchange Fees LitigationBeginning in 2005, several putative class actions were filed against Citigroup 
and Related Parties, together with Visa, MasterCard and other banks 
and their affiliates, in various federal district courts. These actions were 
consolidated with other related cases in the Eastern District of New York and 
captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT 
DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The plaintiffs in the consolidated class 
action are merchants that accept Visa- and MasterCard-branded payment 
cards, as well as membership associations that claim to represent certain 
groups of merchants. The pending complaint alleges, among other things, 
that defendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange 
and merchant discount fees on credit and debit card transactions in violation 
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaint also alleges additional 
Sherman Act and California law violations, including alleged unlawful 
maintenance of monopoly power and alleged unlawful contracts in restraint 
of trade pertaining to various Visa and MasterCard rules governing merchant 288conduct (including rules allegedly affecting merchants™ ability, at the point of sale, to surcharge payment card transactions or steer customers 
to particular payment cards). In addition, supplemental complaints filed 
against defendants in the class action allege that Visa™s and MasterCard™s 
respective initial public offerings were anticompetitive and violated Section 7 
of the Clayton Act, and that MasterCard™s initial public offering constituted a 
fraudulent conveyance. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief as well as joint and several liability for treble their damages, including all interchange fees paid to all Visa and 

MasterCard members with respect to Visa and MasterCard transactions in 

the U.S. since at least January 1, 2004. Certain publicly available documents 
estimate that Visa- and MasterCard-branded cards generated approximately 

$40 billion in interchange fees industry-wide in 2009. Defendants dispute 
that the manner in which interchange and merchant discount fees are set, 
or the rules governing merchant conduct, are anticompetitive. Fact and 
expert discovery has closed. Defendants™ motions to dismiss the pending 
class action complaint and the supplemental complaints are pending. Also 
pending are plaintiffs™ motion to certify nationwide classes consisting of all 
U.S. merchants that accept Visa- and MasterCard-branded payment cards and 

motions by both plaintiffs and defendants for summary judgment. Additional 
information relating to these consolidated actions is publicly available in 
court filings under the docket number MDL 05-1720 (E.D.N.Y.) (Gleeson, J.). 
Parmalat Litigation and Other Matters On July 29, 2004, Dr. Enrico Bondi, the Extraordinary Commissioner 
appointed under Italian law to oversee the administration of various 
Parmalat companies, filed a complaint in New Jersey state court against 
Citigroup and Related Parties alleging that the defendants ﬁfacilitatedﬂ a 
number of frauds by Parmalat insiders. On October 20, 2008, following trial, 
a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup™s favor and in favor of Citibank on 
three counterclaims. The court entered judgment for Citibank in the amount 
of $431 million on the counterclaims, which is accruing interest. Plaintiff™s 
appeal from the court™s final judgment is pending. In addition, prosecutors 
in Parma and Milan, Italy, have commenced criminal proceedings against 
certain current and former Citigroup employees (along with numerous 
other investment banks and certain of their current and former employees, 
as well as former Parmalat officers and accountants). In the event of an 
adverse judgment against the individuals in question, it is possible that the 
authorities could seek administrative remedies against Citigroup. Milan 
prosecutors have requested disgorgement of 70 million Euro and a fine of 
900,000 Euro. Additionally, Dr. Bondi has purported to file a civil complaint 
against Citigroup in the context of the Parma criminal proceedings, seeking 
14 billion Euro in damages. In January 2011, a civil complaint was filed 
by certain institutional investors in Parmalat securities seeking damages 
of approximately 130 million Euro against Citigroup and certain other 
financial institutions.Research Analyst Litigation In March 2004, a putative research-related customer class action alleging 
various state law claims arising out of the issuance of allegedly misleading 
research analyst reports concerning numerous issuers was filed against 
certain Citigroup entities in Illinois state court. Citigroup™s motion to dismiss 
the complaint is pending.Companhia Industrial de Instrumentos de Precisão 
LitigationA commercial customer, Companhia Industrial de Instrumentos de Precisão 
(CIIP), filed a lawsuit against Citibank, N.A., Brazil branch (Citi Brazil), in 
1992, alleging damages arising from an unsuccessful attempt by Citi Brazil 
in 1975 to declare CIIP bankrupt after CIIP defaulted on a loan owed to 
Citi Brazil. The trial court ruled in favor of CIIP and awarded damages that 
Citigroup currently estimates as approximately $330 million after taking 
into account interest, currency adjustments, and current exchange rates. 
Citi Brazil lost its appeal but filed a special appeal to the Superior Tribunal 
of Justice (STJ), the highest appellate court for federal law in Brazil. The 
4th Section of the STJ ruled 3-2 in favor of Citi in November 2008. CIIP 
appealed the decision to the Special Court of the STJ on procedural grounds. 
In December 2009, the Special Court of the STJ decided 9-0 in favor of CIIP 
on the procedural issue, overturning the 3-2 merits decision in favor of Citi. 
Citi Brazil filed a motion for clarification with the Special Court of the STJ. 
A decision on that motion is expected in the first or second quarter of 2011. 
If the Special Court of the STJ were to decide in Citi Brazil™s favor on the 
pending motion for clarification, the effect would be to reinstate the favorable 
3-2 decision of the STJ on the merits of the dispute. If the Special Court were 
to decide in CIIP™s favor, Citi Brazil expects to file a constitutional action with 
the Supreme Court of Brazil seeking to overturn the decision.Allied Irish Bank LitigationIn 2003, Allied Irish Bank (AIB) filed a complaint in the Southern District 
of New York seeking to hold Citibank and Bank of America, former prime 
brokers for AIB™s subsidiary Allfirst Bank (Allfirst), liable for losses incurred 
by Allfirst as a result of fraudulent and fictitious foreign currency trades 
entered into by one of Allfirst™s traders. AIB seeks compensatory damages of 
approximately $500 million, plus punitive damages, from Citibank and Bank 
of America collectively. In 2006, the Court granted in part and denied in part 
defendants™ motion to dismiss. In 2009, AIB filed an amended complaint, 
and the parties currently are engaged in discovery. Settlement Payments Payments required in settlement agreements described above have been 
made or are covered by existing litigation reserves.

29031. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February 1, 2011, Citi acquired 100% of the share capital of Maltby Acquisitions Limited (ﬁMaltbyﬂ), the holding company that controls

securities carried at fair value. The acquisition will not result in a significant 
income statement impact for Citi in the first quarter of 2011.32. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL

Citigroup is regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (FRB). Citigroup™s nationally chartered subsidiary 
banks, including Citibank, N.A., are regulated and supervised by the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), its federal savings associations by 
the Office of Thrift Supervision, and its state-chartered depository institutions 
by state banking departments and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC). The FDIC also has back-up enforcement authority for banking 
subsidiaries whose deposits it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank are 
regulated and supervised by the FRB and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks 
by the FRB. Such overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated 
and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries.A U.S. financial holding company and the companies under its control are permitted to engage in a broader range of activities in the U.S. and 
abroad than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. 
Unless otherwise limited by the FRB, financial holding companies generally 
can engage, directly or indirectly in the U.S. and abroad, in financial 
activities, either de novo or by acquisition, by providing after-the-fact notice 

to the FRB. These financial activities include underwriting and dealing in 
securities, insurance underwriting and brokerage, and making investments 
in non-financial companies for a limited period of time, as long as Citi 
does not manage the non-financial company™s day-to-day activities, and 

its banking subsidiaries engage only in permitted cross-marketing with the 
non-financial company. If Citigroup ceases to qualify as a financial holding 

company, it could be barred from new financial activities or acquisitions, 

and have to discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial 
holding companies.Citi is permitted to acquire U.S. depository institutions, including out-of-state banks, subject to certain restrictions and the prior approval of federal 
banking regulators. In addition, intrastate bank mergers are permitted 
and banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge. A 
national or state bank can also establish a new branch in another state if 
permitted by the other state, and a federal savings association can generally 
open new branches in any state. However, all bank holding companies, 

including Citigroup, must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before 
acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock of a U.S. depository 
institution or bank holding company. The FRB must also approve certain 

additional capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and 
certain acquisitions by Citigroup of an interest in a non-U.S. company, 

including in a foreign bank, as well as the establishment by Citibank of 
foreign branches in certain circumstances.For more information on U.S. and foreign regulation affecting Citigroup and its subsidiaries, see ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ above.Changes in RegulationProposals to change the laws and regulations affecting the banking and 
financial services industries are frequently introduced in Congress, before 
regulatory bodies and abroad that may affect the operating environment of 
Citigroup and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. This 
has been particularly true as a result of the recent financial crisis. Citigroup cannot determine whether any such proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, 
the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation or implementing 
regulations would have upon the financial condition or results of operations 
of Citigroup or its subsidiaries. For additional information regarding 
recently enacted and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives, see 
ﬁManagement™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations Œ Executive Summary Œ 2011 Business Outlook,ﬂ ﬁCapital 
Resources and Liquidityﬂ and ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ above.Other Bank and Bank Holding Company RegulationCitigroup and its banking subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory 
limitations, including requirements for banks to maintain reserves 
against deposits, requirements as to risk-based capital and leverage (see 
ﬁCapital Resources and Liquidityﬂ above and Note 20 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements), restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that 
may be made and the interest that may be charged, and limitations on 
investments that can be made and services that can be offered. The FRB 
may also expect Citigroup to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in 
certain circumstances. Citigroup is also subject to anti-money laundering 
and financial transparency laws, including standards for verifying client 
identification at account opening and obligations to monitor client 
transactions and report suspicious activities.Securities and Commodities RegulationCitigroup conducts securities underwriting, brokerage and dealing activities 
in the U.S. through Citigroup Global Markets Inc., its primary broker-dealer, 
and other broker-dealer subsidiaries, which are subject to regulations of the 
SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and certain exchanges, 
among others. Citigroup conducts similar securities activities outside 
the U.S., subject to local requirements, through various subsidiaries and 
affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in London, which is 
regulated principally by the U.K. Financial Services Authority, and Citigroup 
Global Markets Japan Inc. in Tokyo, which is regulated principally by the 
Financial Services Agency of Japan.Citigroup also has subsidiaries that are members of futures exchanges and 
are registered accordingly. In the U.S., CGMI is a member of the principal 

U.S. futures exchanges, and Citigroup has subsidiaries that are registered 
as futures commission merchants and commodity pool operators with the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC).
CGMI is also subject to Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CTFC, which specify uniform minimum net capital requirements. Compliance with 
these rules could limit those operations of CGMI that require the intensive 
use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the financing 
of customer account balances, and also limits the ability of broker-dealers to 

transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. 
See also ﬁCapital ResourcesŠBroker-Dealer Subsidiariesﬂ and Note 20 to 

the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of capital 
considerations of Citigroup™s non-banking subsidiaries.
DividendsCitigroup is currently subject to restrictions on its ability to pay common 
stock dividends. See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ above. For information on the ability 
of Citigroup™s subsidiary depository institutions and non-bank subsidiaries 
to pay dividends, see ﬁCapital ResourcesŠCapital Resources of Citigroup™s 
Depository Institutionsﬂ and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements above.302Transactions with AffiliatesThe types and amounts of transactions between Citigroup™s U.S. subsidiary depository institutions and their non-bank affiliates are regulated by the FRB, 
and are generally required to be on arm™s-length terms. See also ﬁFunding 
and LiquidityŠLiquidity Transfer Between Entitiesﬂ above.Insolvency of an Insured U.S. Subsidiary Depository 
InstitutionIf the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an FDIC-insured U.S. 
subsidiary depository institution such as Citibank, N.A., upon its insolvency or 
certain other events, the FDIC has the ability to transfer any of the depository 
institution™s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of 
the depository institution™s creditors, enforce the terms of the depository 
institution™s contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm 
contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party.Additionally, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain 
claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution 
would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and 
depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of such 
an institution by any receiver. As a result, such persons would be treated 

differently from and could receive, if anything, substantially less than the 
depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution.An FDIC-insured financial institution that is affiliated with a failed FDIC-insured institution may have to indemnify the FDIC for losses resulting from 
the insolvency of the failed institution. Such an FDIC indemnity claim is 
generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and 
its affiliates and depositors against such depository institution.Privacy and Data SecurityCitigroup is subject to many U.S., state and international laws and regulations 

relating to policies and procedures designed to protect the non-public 

information of its consumers. Citigroup must periodically disclose its privacy 

policy to consumers and must permit consumers to opt out of Citigroup™s 

ability to use such information to market to affiliates and third-party 

non-affiliates under certain circumstances. See also ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ and 

ﬁOperational RiskŠInformation Security and Continuity of Businessﬂ above.CUSTOMERSIn Citigroup™s judgment, no material part of Citigroup™s business depends 
upon a single customer or group of customers, the loss of which would have 
a materially adverse effect on Citi, and no one customer or group of affiliated 
customers accounts for at least 10% of Citigroup™s consolidated revenues.COMPETITIONThe financial services industry, including each of Citigroup™s businesses, 
is highly competitive. Citigroup™s competitors include a variety of other 
financial services and advisory companies such as banks, thrifts, credit 
unions, credit card issuers, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, 
investment banking companies, brokerage firms, investment advisory 
companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, securities processing 
companies, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, automobile 
financing companies, and internet-based financial services companies.Citigroup competes for clients and capital (including deposits and funding in the short- and long-term debt markets) with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product basis. 
Citigroup™s competitive position depends on many factors, including the 

value of Citi™s brand name, reputation, the types of clients and geographies 

served, the quality, range, performance, innovation and pricing of products 

and services, the effectiveness of and access to distribution channels, 
technology advances, customer service and convenience, effectiveness 
of transaction execution, interest rates and lending limits, regulatory 
constraints and the effectiveness of sales promotion efforts. Citigroup™s ability 

to compete effectively also depends upon its ability to attract new employees 
and retain and motivate existing employees, while managing compensation 
and other costs. See ﬁRisk Factorsﬂ above.In recent years, Citigroup has experienced intense price competition in some of its businesses. For example, the increased pressure on trading 
commissions from growing direct access to automated, electronic markets 
may continue to impact Securities and Banking, and technological 
advances that enable more companies to provide funds transfers may 
diminish the importance of Regional Consumer Banking™s role as a 

financial intermediary.
There has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry, particularly as a result of the recent financial 

crisis, through mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. This consolidation 
may produce larger, better capitalized and more geographically diverse 

competitors able to offer a wider array of products and services at more 
competitive prices around the world. In certain geographic regions, 
including ﬁemerging markets,ﬂ our competitors may have a stronger local 
presence, longer operating histories, and more established relationships with 
clients and regulators.PROPERTIESCitigroup™s principal executive offices are located at 399 Park Avenue in 
New York City. Citigroup, and certain of its subsidiaries, is the largest tenant, 
and the offices are the subject of a lease. Citigroup also has additional office 
space in 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City, under a long-term lease. 
Citibank leases one building and owns a commercial condominium unit in 
a separate building in Long Island City, New York, and has a long-term lease 
on a building at 111 Wall Street in New York City, each of which are totally 
occupied by Citigroup and certain of its subsidiaries.Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. leases its principal offices at 388 Greenwich Street in New York City, and also leases the neighboring building 

at 390 Greenwich Street, both of which are fully occupied by Citigroup and 
certain of its subsidiaries.Citigroup™s principal executive offices in 
EMEA are located at 25 and 33 Canada Square in London™s Canary Wharf, with both buildings subject to 

long-term leases. Citigroup is the largest tenant of 25 Canada Square and the 
sole tenant of 33 Canada Square. In Asia, Citigroup™s principal executive offices are in leased premises 
located at Citibank Tower in Hong Kong. Citigroup has major or full 

ownership interests in country headquarter locations in Shanghai, Seoul, 
Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Mumbai.
Citigroup™s principal executive offices in 
Latin America, which also serve as the headquarters of Banamex, are located in Mexico City, in a two-tower 

complex with six floors each, totaling 257,000 rentable square feet.Citigroup also owns or leases over 76.8 million square feet of real estate in 100 countries, comprised of 12,356 properties.303Citigroup continues to evaluate its current and projected space requirements and may determine from time to time that certain of its premises and facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no 
assurance that Citigroup will be able to dispose of any such excess premises 
or that it will not incur charges in connection with such dispositions. Such 
disposition costs may be material to Citigroup™s operating results in a given 

period.Citi has developed programs to achieve long-term energy efficiency objectives and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions with respect to its 
properties. These activities could help to mitigate, but will not eliminate, 
Citigroup™s risk of increased costs from potential future regulatory 

requirements that would impact Citi as a consumer of energy.
For further information concerning leases, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSFor a discussion of Citigroup™s litigation and related matters, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY; PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES; DIVIDENDS Unregistered Sales of Equity SecuritiesNone.Share RepurchasesUnder its long-standing repurchase program, Citigroup may buy back common shares in the market or otherwise from time to time.

is used for many purposes, including offsetting dilution from stock-based 
compensation programs. The following table summarizes Citigroup™s share repurchases

For so long as the U.S. government continues to hold any Citigroup trust preferred securities acquired pursuant to the exchange offers consummated in 2009, Citigroup is prohibited from redeeming or repurchasing any of its equity or trust preferred securities, subject to certain customary exemptions.304DividendsFor a summary of the cash dividends paid on Citi™s outstanding common stock during 2009 and 2010, see Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. For so long as the U.S. government holds any Citigroup trust 
preferred securities acquired pursuant to the exchange offers consummated 
in 2009, Citigroup has agreed not to pay a quarterly common stock dividend 
exceeding $0.01 per quarter, subject to certain customary exceptions. 
Further, any dividend on Citi™s outstanding common stock would need to be 
made in compliance with Citi™s obligations to any remaining outstanding 
Citigroup preferred stock.PERFORMANCE GRAPHComparison of Five-Year Cumulative Total ReturnThe following graph and table compare the cumulative total return on Citigroup™s common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 
Index and the S&P Financial Index over the five-year period extending 
through December 31, 2010. The graph and table assume that $100 was 
invested on December 31, 2005 in Citigroup™s common stock, the S&P 500 
Index and the S&P Financial Index and that all dividends were reinvested.
