of the complaint.  Neither party is bound by our recommendation and the parties are free to pursue any available remedy. The Role of the BMO Office of the OmbudsmanIn any large organization, breakdowns in 
communication and differences of opinion may occur. Recognizing this potential, BMO Financial Group (BMO) has established processes to allow customers to raise a concern with local staff and, if necessary, escalate it to a BMO Senior Officer*.  Our experience is that an 
overwhelming majority of customer issues are resolved through these processes and we encourage customers to take advantage of them before contacting the BMO Office of the Ombudsman.The role of the BMO Office of the Ombudsman is to assist BMO™s Canadian customers in settling any issues which have not been resolved.  The BMO Office of the Ombudsman provides an impartial forum for an objective review of such concerns.  The staff of the BMO Office of 
the Ombudsman has been carefully chosen for their broad experience in financial services and is dedicated solely to resolving customer complaints.Our reviews focus on ascertaining the facts and reviewing them in an unbiased and impartial manner. Our Review ProcessThe Ombudsman Review Process Upon receiving a request for a review of an issue, we will promptly acknowledge receipt and inform you of the next steps.  If your concern has not been reviewed by a BMO Senior Officer*, we will refer it 
directly to the appropriate person at BMO and inform you.  However, if your concern has already been reviewed by a BMO Senior Officer* and remains unresolved, then we will advise you of the terms of the BMO Ombudsman™s mandate and, if 
your complaint appears to fall within that mandate, the review process we follow and the confidentiality requirements applicable to both you and BMO.  We 
will ask you to sign a letter acknowledging that you understand the review process and agree to the confidentiality requirements.  Once we have received the signed letter back from you, we will 
open a review file.During the course of our review we will normally communicate with you by mail or telephone.  We 
will not communicate confidential personal or account details by email to ensure confidentiality.The time required to complete a review can vary, and although we make every effort to complete all reviews within 90 days, more complex cases may take longer to complete.  Our experience indicates that taking the necessary time to ensure we have fully reviewed your concern facilitates an acceptable 
resolution.  Once we have finished our review, we advise you in writing of our findings and recommendation for a fair resolution of the complaint.If you are not satisfied with the results of our review, options available to you include escalating your complaint to the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) or OmbudService for Life & Health Insurance (OLHI) within 180 days.  You may also contact OBSI or OHLI if you have waited more than 90 days for a resolution after 
escalating your concern to a BMO Senior Officer*.
