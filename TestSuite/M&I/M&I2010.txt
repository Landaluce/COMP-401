Our Strategic Priorities
4  BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
Our practices continue to evolve
Recent events have caused financial institutions everywhere to reconsider the way 
they operate. 
Our customers and their relationships with money have changed also 
Œ as they, too, 
adjust to the current reality.

As directors of Bank of Montreal, responsible for the oversight of a large, complex 
organization, we are keenly aware that good governance represents a competitive 

advantage. The banks that emerged from the financial crisis in good shape were those 

with the best controls in place, and the discipline to adhere to them. Canadian banks 

fared better than most. It is not a coincidence that Canadian banks are recognized 

for the quality of their governance, and we are proud that BMO ranks among the top 

companies in Canada for governance.
Achieving good governance, however, is not a fixed target. It is forever moving, steadily 
improving. At BMO, we strive constantly for board renewal 
Œ new ideas, new approaches, 
new points of view.

Since I was named Chairman of the Board in 2004, more than one-third of the faces 
on the board have changed. This is in line with our desire to have the right blend of 

experience and knowledge, tempered with fresh perspective. This year, in the spirit of 

renewal, we have introduced term limits for board membership. Once phased in, BMO 

directors will be limited to 15 years of service, or until their 70th birthday, whichever 

comes first.
After 24 years of service, Jeremy Reitman leaves the board this year, as does Nancy 
Southern, who has served shareholders for 15 ye
ars. On behalf of shareholders, I thank 
them for their invaluable contributions to the company over their years of service. 

We will miss their insight and guidance. We were pleased to announce the appointment 

of Christine Edwards of Chicago to the board in August 2010. 
Finally, I want to offer our thanks to management and all employees for delivering 
strong financial results in the past year. The bank has grown, both within our traditional 
markets as well as in markets that will be of increasing importance to us. The incorporation
 of BMO ChinaCo (see page 18), for example, was an important strategic milestone for 

the company. I also want to recognize our employees’ contribution to important initiatives 
Œ the kind that are never reflected adequately in the bottom line. Under Bill Downe’s 
leadership, bank employees, enterprise-wide, supported their communities in record 
manner, donating time and money to the United Way. They also embraced the bank’s 
environmental goals and helped us, during the course of the year, achieve carbon neutrality 
relative to energy consumption and transportation emissions.

PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MESSAGE
Setting higher standards
The financial services industry has changed for the better. The establishment of new rules 
under which financial institutions will operate has not only been necessary, it is right 
Œ both for the overall stability of financial markets and for the customers we serve.
At BMO, we’re positioned for success in this environment. It’s not just a matter 
of meeting new regulations. Customers are changing the rules of the game as well. 

People’s relationship with money has evolved, so too has their relationship with 

their financial institution.
This is why the theme running through our an
nual report is: competing in a changing 
world. It’s changing because people are reassessing their idea of value. They want 
the freedom to do their banking everywhere. They expect a higher standard of social 
responsibility from companies than ever before. And in a marketplace where change 

itself has become so profound, a company’s vision is only as strong as its people.
Strong performance in 2010
BMO’s financial and operating results in 2010
 reflect the success of our 38,000 employees 
in meeting our customers’ needs and striving for higher performance. Net income 

increased to $2.8 billion, driven in large part by strong revenue growth of 10.4%. BMO’s 

return on equity continued to improve, reaching 14.9%.
The year was characterized by significant achievement across each of our operating 
groups. This performance is demonstrated by our pre-tax pre-provision earnings, which 
reached $4.6 billion, the highest in the histor
y of the bank. We achieved these results 
while maintaining financial strength and flexibility, managing impaired loans, capitalizing 

on unique expansion initiatives and investing in future growth.
This was accomplished against a dramatic backdrop including G20 initiatives to stimulate 
growth; continued regulatory efforts to address systemic vulnerabilities and to develop 

new policies; the formulation of new Basel III capital rules; and active legislative agendas 
in both developed and emerging economies. At BMO, we view these changes to the 
operating environment as an opportunity 
Œ and source of advantage 
Œ as we move ahead 
with our strategic priorities.
Making money make sense
We have a brand promise common to every business 
Œ our commitment to customers 
and their success is tangible. BMO has a clear strategy and strong execution capabilities. 

Everything we’re undertaking 
Œ from customer offers to the 7,640 employees across 
North America who completed customer experience and sales training this year 
Œ lines up to support our brand: Making money make sense.
Our ability to stay ahead of our custom
ers’ changing needs is reflected in BMO’s 
internal advocacy. It has never been higher: 95% of our employees said they personally 
recommend our products and services and 98% said they believe in the strategy.
Our strong balance sheet, liquidity, capital position, reputation and people reinforce our 
ability to react to opportunities.
Our Customers’ Success Defines Our Success
BMO is a company 

deeply rooted 

in the economic 

advancement of 

North America 
William A. Downe
President and Chief Executive Officer
6  BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
Creating opportunity
Customers’ preferences have shifted. None of us want to forget the lessons of the last 
three years. We’re all paying more attention to our finances. This re-emergence of clients’ 

appreciation of consistency and value is something that plays to our core strengths. 

And it is what BMO is delivering.
We are very proud of the performance of our personal and commercial bank in 
Canada. Even for a company as diversified as ours, it is a barometer of the health of our 

organization. We are building BMO Bank of Montreal through investments in front-line 
staff and the expansion of our branch network, online and customer contact capabilities. 
We intend to keep this business growing. In so doing, we not only create opportunities 

for our customers, but also for our other businesses.
Our intense focus on personal and commer
cial banking in North America reflects 
our commitment to leverage one of the bank
’s greatest strengths: our brand and strong 
reputation. Making money make sense speaks directly to customers as individuals 
Œ whether they’re acting for themselves, or as entrepreneurs, or as the leaders of the 
companies and institutions with which we do business. Maintaining a balance when 
it comes to controlling spending, growing savings, borrowing smartly and investing 
wisely is important. Our role at BMO is to help customers make sense of these things. 
It is where customers most value the help of a bank and where we are most capable 
Œ combining our understanding of
 customers with our capital 
Œ to take full advantage of 
this unique market position.
A clear strategy rests on a strong foundation
2010 confirms we are on the right path. We are well positioned with a clear strategy, 
and a brand promise common to every business. As we reach important milestones our 
aspirations remain ambitious. There is much yet to be accomplished.

BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010  
7 Supporting our vision is a belief in the importance of both maintaining strong core 
capabilities and investing in the quality and knowledge of the people who are providing 

guidance and advice to our customers. We are maintaining a sharp focus on improving 

our processes and technology to provide our clients with the products, services and 

tools that will ensure their success in a fa
st-changing environment. We are intensifying 
collaboration North-South and across groups to provide meaningful efficiency and 

scale for the benefit of customers.
As the context in which we compete changes, strong core capabilities are critical to 
ensure reliability and resilience. And we are continuing to invest with a view to meeting 

future demands. This will ensure that BMO remains uniquely positioned to grow.
The progress of the bank relies on its employees and their ability and commitment 
to deliver against these different elements. Every member of the team 
Œ from senior 
management to investment professionals to front-line bankers 
Œ must be confident 
and capable. We continue to invest in the skills necessary to sustain successful long-term 

growth 
Œ and we are active in ensuring we have the best learning and development 
programs available.
Generating returns for shareholders
Our focus is entirely on the things that will de
fine the next phase of our growth and translate 

our brand promise into a new set of capabilities 
Œ to support our customers in fulfilling their 
ambitions in new ways… ways, perhaps, they have yet to envisage.
I believe that the potential returns from investing in our businesses today are better 

than at any time in the past decade. In a changing world, it is likely that there will be 
consolidation in financial markets that will create opportunities for BMO. Equally important 
will be consistent investment in new distribution points, in finding new ways to reach 
customers, and in product and service innovation that empowers those customers to make 

informed decisions 
Œ always with the sure sense they’re in control.
BMO is a company deeply rooted in the economic success of North America, serving 

customers for 193 years. For our shareholder
s, we are committed to building the value 
of the bank and demonstrating consistent growth in common share dividends over time. 

Our strategic path is clear; we are focused on performance in the year ahead and 

confident in our plans to invest in future growth.
The opportunity to serve our customers is a privilege for me and for our entire team. 
I thank our employees for their contributions in 
2010 and pass on to you, our shareholders, 

sincere thanks for your support.

8  BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
As life unfolds, we all make financial 
choices to meet specific goals 
Œ borrowing 
to buy a home, for instance, or allocating 

savings for a family trip or a child’s 

education. Over the past decade, such 

decisions were too often made without 

reference to the bigger picture. The appeal 

of immediate answers took precedence 

over the merits of a balanced, long-term 

strategy. 
The economic downturn changed all that 
Œ or accelerated a shift in thinking. Today 
people want a holistic view of their personal 
finances. They’re more aware of how 

individual decisions are part of a total life 

cycle in which each step depends on all 

the others. There exists a balance between 

controlling spending, growing savings, 
The past three years brought global realities down to the personal level. Now millions 
of people have reassessed their priorities with newfound clarity. As we move forward 
and the sense of urgency passes, our relationship with money, in many ways, will 
have changed.
with money is changing.
Ourrelationship
 borrowing smartly and investing wisely. 
And at every stage, we need to feel that 

we’re reasonably protected against risk.
As the economy slowly regains momentum, 
people are examining how they manage 

their money and asking tougher questions 

of themselves. Equally, they believe that 

financial institutions have a responsibility 

to understand their situation, offer 

straightforward advice and lead the 

way forward.
Faced with a daily barrage of unfiltered 
information, customers are seeking 

meaningful conversations and insights. 

They expect an institution to educate 

and offer counsel and advice, providing 

rules of thumb on the right levels of 
debt and savings. They want a financial 

coach who’ll keep them on their game 

year in, year out.
Above all, people want an institution 
to practice what it preaches by presenting 

options with a broad and balanced 
perspective. Bankers cannot simply 

be sellers 
of investment products or the 
gatekeepers of credit. They must be 

trusted allies whose advice looks beyond 

a moment in the market, or the wish 

to make a sale, to always put the 

customer’s interest first. 
As people’s relationship with money 
changes, their relationship with financial 

institutions has to change as well.
BMO MoneyLogic
Customers tell us they want to better 
understand their finances and be 

more active in managing their money. 

With MoneyLogic, the new personal 

financial management tool from BMO, 

they can easily view, track and 

manage their spending and savings 

online. They can also use the free tool 

to prepare personal budgets and set 

savings goals. 
“We’re listening. Clear information and advice 
are at the heart of making money 
make sense at BMO.”
More Smart Steps
BMO introduced SmartSteps to Canadians 

to provide them with ways to save 

money quickly, become debt-free faster 

and better manage their spending. 

Building on the program’s success, 

we followed up in 2010 with SmartSteps 

for Business, SmartSteps for Investing 

and SmartSteps for Students, as well as 

Harris Helpful Steps in our U.S. markets.
Creating Confidence
Having access to the right information 
Œ relevant, clear and straightforward 
Œ is 
the first step toward achieving financial 

control and confidence. We’ve made clear 

information and advice a key part of our 

offering at BMO. Whether we’re making our 

banking agreements easier to understand, 

clearly disclosing our fee structures 

and interest rate calculations, or providing 

resources to help in decision-making, 

customers can count on BMO for easy 

access to the information they need.

value
We’re rethinking what 
really means. 
As the choices around us change, so do the yardsticks by which we evaluate them. 
True value, however, has become increasingly difficult to gauge. Too many opportunities 

come wrapped in layers of complexity that may hide a lack of proven benefits. Attractive 

propositions are too often several steps removed from what’s honest and fair.
So where should the search for value now 
be focused? Price is an important factor, but 
it doesn’t go far enough: not every product 
or service can be commoditized with the 

rigour of big-box retailing. By the same 

token, volume discounts and bundling of 

services can’t capture the full spectrum 

of value that today’s consumers expect.
In financial services, what matters as 
much as cost is transparency. Customers 

want clear explanations of exactly what 

each service entails. They expect fees 

to be reasonable and fair. 
Innovation is another driver of value. 
People welcome the convenience of new 

technologies and the precious time that 

more efficient services can save them. 
They also put a premium on sustainable 

choices now that the pendulum is swinging 

away from unchecked consumption.
But the most significant source of value is a 
rigorous set of expectations around service 

and performance 
Œ that have been met. 
In rethinking what value really means, 
people now apply a sharper lens when eval-

uating whether a company really measures 
up. They still want tangible returns, of course,
 and a foundation for future growth. They 
want relevant advice that reflects a thorough 
understanding of their needs. They want 

clearly defined goals, commitments and 
obligations on both sides 
Œ with no surprises. 
And they want to feel that their financial 

institution is investing as much as they are 

in the relationship.
Above all, customers want the confidence 

of knowing that their decisions are backed 

by a wealth of experience 
Œ and by 

an institution that only makes promises 

it can keep.
Value is not a fixed point. It changes through 
the process of discovering, questioning 

and refining its many dimensions. Today, 
customers understand that they can only 
realize true value by participating more 

actively in the decision-making process 
Œ and institutions must be ready to help 

make that happen.
The Flexible Investor 
Customers have told us they want greater 
control and flexibility when it comes 

to investing. It’s one of the reasons BMO 

has taken the lead with Exchange Traded 

Funds (ETFs). ETFs combine the advantages 

of low cost, diversity, flexibility and tax 

efficiency to give investors a greater sense 

of control over their portfolios. BMO 

currently offers 30 ETFs.
At BMO Nesbitt Burns, the Architect 
Program is making it possible for investors 

to hold both managed and non-managed 

investment vehicles in a single account. 

Customers enjoy a clear view of their total 

investment picture, along with the benefits 

of professional management.

As our lives become increasingly mobile, we expect 
instant access to information and services 
wherever we are. Technology is making this possible 
Œ but only as a means to an end. 
What we really need is to feel confident that we’re in control of each new situation and 
prepared to make all the right choices as we move through the world.
everywhere.
We want the freedom 
to make financial decisions 
When people talk about being connected 
everywhere, it’s with a different sense 

of place than they had a generation or 

even a decade ago. Shopping no longer 

requires stores. Classrooms have become 

online spaces. Employees work from 

home or take their virtual offices on the 

road. Markets are defined as much by 

the exchange of bits and bytes as they 

are by trade in goods and services. 
At the same time, people are travelling 
further and more frequently than ever 
before. While political borders remain intact 

and in some places are etched more deeply, 
in the world of commerce, traditional 

boundaries are disappearing. Businesses 

make investments and forge partnerships 
in every corner of the globe. And people 

follow their education and career goals 

wherever opportunity leads them.
For financial institutions, meeting 
expec 
tations in a borderless world means 
providing the one essential resource 

required by both organizations and 
indiv 
iduals: timely, accurate and secure 
information. Businesspeople and consumers 
alike want a comprehensive picture of 

their past transactions and current situation. 

They need data they can trust, understand 

and immediately act upon. And they want 

expert guidance on a range of potential 

strategies 
Œ at any time of day, wherever 
they happen to be.
Above all, customers want to feel that 
they’re in control, that the choices they 

make are not constrained by a need 
for anyone else’s permission or approval. 

The information that reaches them on 

the move is ultimately validated by the 

confidence it instills 
Œ in helping to shape 
a clear, well-grounded plan. 
As we reassess our relationship with money, 

the financial institutions that provide true 
value understand that the ability to make 
informed decisions everywhere is not 

about devices, it’s about independence. 
BMO on YouTube 
Social media offer us a whole new way 
to interact with customers on their terms. 

Webcasts on the BMO Capital Markets 

portal give investors access to the opinions 

and research of our key economists.

eldercare advice, ranging from how 

to navigate important legal and financial 

decisions to avoiding caregiver burnout. 

BMO Money Diarie$ invites students 

to share their ideas for managing their 

money while at school.
Experts on Demand
Team members come together from across 

financial disciplines to ensure the solutions 

we provide fit with the client’s overall 

financial picture. TelePresence is helping. 

This video conferencing tool allows us 

to bring the best BMO financial experts

clients, everywhere they’re needed.
Going Beyond
The growth of our network in 

China is helping us provide seamless 

service to customers preparing to 

immigrate to North America, and to 

customers wanting to invest in China.

in China and India are also providing 
valuable pathways for our commercial

14  BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
Today people expect more of businesses than ever before. But as they set higher standards 
and apply closer scrutiny, what they’re really looking for comes down to one key element: 

responsibility. It’s what market leaders have always done 
Œ act responsibly to achieve 
sustainable positive results. 
A company’s first 
responsibility is to be 
well managed.
As the uncertainty that swept financial 
markets in late 2008 led to a global 

downturn, the impact on individual lives 

was mirrored in the damaged reputations 

of businesses that had lost their way 

and disappointed long-time stakeholders. 

The public conversation soon turned 

from specific examples of questionable 

judgment to broader issues of corporate 

governance and accountability. 
Customers want to know that they can 
still invest their most valued asset: trust. 
People want to see that institutions are 
actively striving to meet and exceed their 
high expectations. Gauging the depth 

of that commitment means looking beyond 
corporate declarations of vision and values. 
Organizations, like individuals, are judged 

not by what they say, but by what they do. 
A company’s good name is a reward 

bestowed by customers who feel their 
needs have been well served. Financial 

institutions earn solid reputations 

through sound decision-making and by 
upholding the principles of responsible 
manage 
ment, maintaining capital 
strength and strategically managing 
risk in complex global markets. 
As Canada’s financial sector reaffirms its 
stewardship role in ensuring economic 

stability, governance practices must be 

rigorous and transparent. Codes of conduct 

must extend beyond the boardroom to treat 

all employees equitably and welcome their 

diverse points of view. Customers must 
receive the same level of respect, whether 
in a branch down the street or an office 
halfway 
around the globe. Communities 
should be able to count on support 

for local efforts to improve health and 

prosperity. And the entire planet should 
benefit from companies’ efforts to 
reduce their collective footprint. 
Measuring success against the triple 
bottom line of social, economic and environ-
mental responsibility is not a matter 

of compliance 
Œ it’s a business imperative. 

From adopting greener practices to 

safe 
guarding against risk, responsible 
choices spur competition, inspire innovation 
and drive sustainable growth. And 
the loyalty they create is embodied 

in the ultimate hallmark of corporate 
responsibility: reputation.

Ideas are a new global currency. But it’s important to remind ourselves that those ideas 
come from people. In the end, people, not companies, create world-changing breakthroughs. 

And it’s human vision that gives ideas their power.
A company’s 
is only as strong as its people.
visionAs this knowledge economy matures, 
we’re less inclined to applaud innovation 

for its own sake. Faced with consumer 

trends that seem to change as often as the 

weather, we’re becoming more thoughtful 

about what really matters. Our focus is 

shifting from having the latest to getting 

the best 
Œ smart products and services 

created by people who’ve paid attention 

and anticipated our needs.
What differentiates today’s successful 
companies is the ability to address our 

expectations and aspirations by thinking 
beyond the obvious. And what will 
keep such businesses sustainable in an 

increasingly competitive world is the 

quality of their people.
Recruiting top talent has long been a 

priority for the entrepreneurial businesses 

that are catalysts of economic growth. 

The ability to attract, develop and retain 

the best people has become a strategic 

imperative for companies worldwide. 

Industry leaders engage skilled, imaginative 

people in designing products that resonate, 

in devising better models of service 
Œ in focusing their collective energy on 

creating more meaningful interactions 

with customers.
And diversity is no longer just a noble 
goal Œ it’s the key to success. Having the 
best people means finding the sharpest 
minds in a global talent pool. Successful 
organizations become more relevant by 
welcoming the varied perspectives and 
cultural nuances of vibrant, emerging 

markets across town and around the planet. 
What drives the knowledge economy 
is the same fuel that keeps today’s smart 

companies alert, creative and connected: 

vision. And that vision is conceived by 

people. It’s about confidently embracing 

a world that’s changed 
Œ and that will 
change even more tomorrow.

CORPORATE DIRECTORY
• Our core values guide the board’s oversight, relationship with 
management and accountability to shareholders
• Our governance responsibilities are integral to our performance 
and long-term sustainability
• We embrace high standards of corporate governance, which reflect 
not only applicable legal and re
gulatory requirem
ents but also 
evolving best practices
• Sound corporate governance is the foundation for responsible 
business behaviour towards our shareholders, employees, 
customers, and the communities and environment in which 

we operate
“ The Board of 
Directors of 
Bank of Montreal 
is committed 
to leadership 

in corporate 

governance.”
David Galloway
Chairman of the Board
The bank’s director and executive compen-
sation programs are strongly aligned with 
governance best practices. Minimum share 

ownership requirements for directors and 
executives ensure the alignment of interests 
with shareholders. Our executive compen-

sation programs establish clear pay for 
performance linkages. The programs, which 
include the use of clawbacks, do not 

encourage excessive risk-taking. 
The board and its committees play a central 
role in the enterprise’s risk management 

framework, including through the approval 

of our corporate policies and the guidance 

provided by the risk review committee 

of the board.
The board supports the bank’s efforts 
to communicate with its shareholders and 

other stakeholders through a variety of 

channels, including the annual report, proxy 
circular, quarterly reports, annual information 
form, news releases, website and industry 

conferences. In 2010, the board approved 
a shareholder engagement policy promoting 
open dialogue and the exchange of ideas 

with the bank’s shareholders. 
Bank of Montreal’s Board of Directors is 

responsible for the supervision of manage-
ment of the business and affairs of the bank 
with the objective of enhancing shareholder 

value. The recent financial crisis has high-

lighted the importance for the board to 

provide well-informed strategic direction 

and oversight that looks beyond short-term 

financial performance. The board’s focus 

on corporate governance is seen in its 

various practices and procedures.
The board has adopted position descriptions 
for the Chairman of the Board, the commit-

tee chairs and the directors, all of which are 

available on our website. The board’s man-

date outlines the general responsibilities of 

the board, while the bank’s board approval 

and oversight guidelines define the roles 

and responsibilities of the board and man-

agement and explicitly delineate the lines 

of accountability within the bank. 
The Chairman of the Board is an independent 
director who ensures that the board oper-

ates separately from management and that 
directors have an independent leadership 

contact. The Chairman manages the affairs 

of the board, with a view to ensuring that 
the board functions effectively and meets 

its obligations and responsibilities, including 
its responsibilities to shareholders. In 2010, 
the board approved a written process for the 

appointment of the Chairman of the Board. 
FirstPrinciples, our comprehensive code 
of business conduct and ethics, provides 

a frame 
work for directors, officers and 
employees on their conduct and ethical 

decision-making. The board, through its 

Audit Committee, reviews the operation of 

FirstPrinciples. Each year, every director, 
officer and employee must sign an acknowl-
edgement that they have read, understood 

and complied with 
FirstPrinciples. Our whistleblower procedures allow 

officers and employees to report violations 

of 
FirstPrinciples, and concerns regarding 
accounting, internal accounting controls or 
auditing matters on a confidential and 

anonymous basis. The board believes that 

providing a forum for employees and 

officers to raise concerns about ethical con-

duct and treating all complaints with the 

appropriate level of seriousness, including 
escalation to the board and Audit Committee 
where appropriate, fosters a culture of 

ethical conduct within the bank.

Five-Year Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR)
•  BMO shareholders have earned an average annual 
ret
urn of 5.9% over the past five years.
•  The one-year TSR in 2010 was a strong 26.4%, well 

above the c
omparable market indices in both 
Canada and the United States. BMO’s one-year TSR 

has exceeded 20% in three of the past five years. 
Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth
•  EPS grew 54% to $4.75 in 2010. Net income 
incre
ased more than $1 billion to $2.8 billion, 
while the average number of common shares 

outstanding increased modestly.
•  EPS growth was driven by strong growth in 

rev
enues and lower provisions for credit losses. 
Return on Equity (ROE)
•  ROE improved from 9.9% to 14.9% in 2010, 

pri
marily due to an increase of more than 
$1 billion in earnings available to common 

shareholders, while we continued to enhance 

our strong capital position.
•  BMO has achieved an ROE of 13% or better 

in 20 of the pas
t 21 years.
Net Economic Profit (NEP) Growth
•  NEP, a measure of added economic value, 

was $
818 million, up from a loss of $68 million 
in 2009.
•  The improvement was attributable to the 

signific
ant increase in earnings, net of a higher 
charge for capital as a result of an increase 

in shareholders’ equity. 
Revenue Growth
•  Revenue increased $1,146 million or 10.4% to 

$12
,210 million in 2010, following growth of 8.4% 
in 2009 and 9.2% in 2008. The consistently high 

growth rates demonstrate the benefit of our 

diversified business mix.
•  There was solid growth in each of the operating 

groups ex
cept P&C U.S., where revenues were 
modestly higher on a U.S. dollar basis. 
Productivity Ratio 
(Expense-to-Revenue Ratio)
•  The productivity ratio was 62.2%, an improvement 
of 450 basis points from 2009. Similarly, the cash 

productivity ratio improved 440 basis points 

to 61.9%. 
•  The improvement was due to strong revenue growth 

combined with effective expense management.
Note 1. Results stated on a cash basis as well as NEP 
are non-GAAP measures. Please see page 91 for a discussion 

of the use of non-GAAP measures.
Certain BMO and peer group prior year data has been restated to 

conform with the current year’s basis of presentation.
Results are as at or for the years ended October 31 for Canadian banks 
and as at or for the years ended September 30 for U.S. banks.
Financial Performance and Condition at a Glance
Peer Group Performance
Five-Year TSR
•  The Canadian peer group average annual five-year TSR was 
7.9%. The one-year TSR was 22.5%.
•  The North American peer group average annual five-year TSR of 

–0.5% and one-year TSR of 13.4% were well below the Canadian 
averages, as U.S. bank results continued to be more affected 
by credit losses. 
EPS Growth
 (%)•  The Canadian peer group average EPS increased 42%, compared 

with 9.6% in 2009. All banks in the peer group saw healthy increases 

in EPS, due in part to lower credit losses.
•  Net income available to common shareholders of the North American
 peer group was low in 2009, as five of our peers recorded losses due 
to the difficult credit conditions and weak economic environment, 

resulting in overall peer group EPS growth of –80%. Net income 
available to common share 
holders in 2010 was 14 times as high as the 
2009 level, due to lower credit losses and low funding costs in 2010.
ROE
 (%)•  The Canadian peer group average ROE of 15.2% increased 

from the average return in 2009, as ROE improved for each 

bank in the peer group due to higher earnings.
•  ROE for the North American peer group was 8.8%. 

ROE for each of our U.S. peers was less than BMO’s and 

three U.S. banks reported negative returns.
NEP Growth
 (%)•  The Canadian peer group average NEP growth was 212.0%, 

as some banks in the peer group recorded significant increases 

in NEP from the low levels of a year ago.
•  NEP growth for the North American peer group was 86.4%, 

as NEP was significantly higher for all but one of our U.S. peers. 
Revenue Growth
 (%)•  Revenue growth for the Canadian peer group 

averaged 5.9%.
•  Revenue growth for the North American peer group 
averaged 9.8%, reflecting particularly strong growth 

recorded by a few members of the peer group.
Peer group data for 2009 is not to scale.
Productivity Ratio
 (%)•  The Canadian peer group average productivity ratio 

was 59.9%, improving from 63.7% in 2009 due to solid 

revenue growth and good expense control.
•  The average productivity ratio for the North American 

peer group was 60.9%, a level that remains worse than 

the average of our Canadian peers but better than 

the ratio in 2009.

Peer Group Performance
The Canadian peer group averages are based on the performance of Canada’s six largest banks: BMO Financial Group, Canadian Impe
rial Bank 
of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, RBC Financial Group, Sc
otiabank and TD Bank Financial Group. The North American peer grou
p averages 
are based on the performance of 13 of the largest banks in Nort
h America. It includes the Canadian peer group, except National 
Bank of Canada, 
as well as BB&T Corporation, Fifth Third Bancorp, Key Corp., Bank of New York Mellon, The PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Re
gions Financial, 
SunTrust Banks Inc. and U.S. Bancorp. The North American peer group was redeﬁ ned in 2010. Prior year averages have not been restated.
Our Performance 
(Note 1)
Credit Losses
•  The provision for credit losses (PCL) fell to $1,049 million from 
$1,603 million in 2009. There was no change in the general 

allowance, compared with a $60 million increase a year ago.
•  PCL as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances fell 

to 61 basis points from 88 basis points a year ago. Credit market 

conditions improved but remain challenging in certain sectors. 
Impaired Loans
•  Gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL) decreased 

to $3,221 million from $3,297 million in 2009, and 

represented 13.6% of equity and allowances for credit losses. 

GIL includes $302 million in respect of loans acquired in 2010 

for which there is a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC.
•  Formations of new impaired loans and acceptances, a key 

driver of provisions for credit losses, were $1,525 million, 

down 43% from $2,690 million in 2009, with the United States 

accounting for the majority of the impaired formations. 
Cash and Securities-to-Total Assets
•  The cash and securities-to-total assets ratio increased 

to 35.0% from 31.9% in 2009, reflecting a strong 

liquidity position.
•  Liquidity continues to be supported by our large base 

of customer deposits and our strong capital position.
Capital Adequacy
•  The Tier 1 Capital Ratio remained strong at 13.45%, 

up from 12.24% in 2009.
•  The Total Capital Ratio was 15.91%, up from 14.87% 

in 2009.
Credit Rating
•  BMO’s credit ratings, as assessed by t
he four major ratings agencies, are listed 
below. There was one downgrade in 2010 and all four ratings are considered 

high-grade and high quality.
•  Credit ratings are important in the raisi
ng of both capital and funding to support 
our business operations. Maintaining strong credit ratings allows us to access 

the capital markets at competitive pricing. Should our credit ratings materially 

decrease, our cost of funds would likely increase significantly and our access 

to funding and capital through capital markets could be reduced. A material 

downgrade of our ratings could have additional consequences, including those 

set out in Note 10 on page 130 of the financial statements.
Cash and Securities-to-Total Assets
 (%)•  The cash and securities-to-total assets ratio for 

the Canadian peer group of 31.0% was unchanged from 

2009 levels. The average ratio remains at a level that 

is in line with historic averages. 
•  The North American peer group average ratio was 30.4% 

in 2010, a level that is up from a year ago but marginally 

below the average of our Canadian peers.
Capital Adequacy
•  The Canadian peer group average Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

was 12.81% in 2010, up from 11.78% in 2009, as all banks 

in the peer group had higher capital ratios. 
•  The basis for computing capital adequacy ratios is not 

comparable in Canada and the United States.
 •  The Canadian peer group median credit ratings were unchanged in 2010. 

Each of the median Canadian peer group ratings is considered high-grade 

and high quality.
•  The North American peer group median credit rating as assessed by 
one of the ratings agencies fell slightly from 2009, while another increased 
slightly. Three of the ratings were slightly lower than the median of 
the Canadian peer group, as economic conditions remain more difficult 
in the United States.

Provision for Credit Losses as a % of Average 
Net Loans and Acceptances
•  The Canadian peer group average PCL represented 
56 basis points of average net loans and acceptances, 

down from 90 basis points in 2009.
•  The North American peer group average PCL was 137 basis 

points, well below the 2009 level but still elevated, as 

U.S. bank results continued to be severely affected by 

weakness in the real estate market and broader economy.
Gross Impaired Loans and Acceptances as a 
% of Equity and Allowances for Credit Losses
•  The Canadian peer group average was in line with last 
year, at 11.0% of equity and allowances for credit losses.
•  The average ratio for North American banks was also 

in line with a year ago, at 13.9%, and remains higher 

than the average of the Canadian peer group.

26 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AEstablished in 1817, BMO Financial Group is a highly diversified North American financial services provider. With total assets 
of $412 billion and 
38,000 employees, BMO provides a broad range of retail banking, wealth management and investment banking products and services.
 We serve more 
than seven million customers across Canada through our Canadian retail arm, BMO Bank of Montreal. We also serve customers through our wealth 
management businesses, BMO Nesbitt Burns, BMO InvestorLine, BMO Insurance and BMO Harris Private Banking. BMO Capital Markets, 
our North American investment and corporate banking division, provides a full suite of financial products and services to our North Ameri
can and international 
clients. In the United States, BMO serves customers through Chicago-based Harris, an integrated financial services organization with almost 1.3 million 
retail, small business and commercial customers. BMO Financial Gr
oup comprises three operating groups: Personal and Commercial 
Banking, 
Private Client Group and BMO Capital Markets.
Who We Are 
Our Financial Objectives
BMO’s vision, guiding principle and medium-term financial objectives

for certain important performance measures are set out in the adjacent 

chart. We believe that we will maximize total shareholder return and 
meet our medium-term financial objectives by aligning our operations 

with and executing on our strategic priorities, as outlined on the 

following page.
BMO’s business planning process is rigorous and considers the 
prevailing economic conditions, our customers’ evolving needs and
the opportunities available across our lines of business. It includes

clear and direct accountability for annual performance that is measured 

against internal and external benchmarks and progress towards our 

strategic priorities.
Our medium-term financial objectives of, over time, increasing 
earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 12% per year, earning an 

average annual return on equity (ROE) of 17% to 20% and maintaining 
strong capital ratios that meet both current and expected regulatory 
requirements are key guideposts as we execute against our strategic 
priorities. Our operating philosophy is to increase revenues at rates 
higher than general economic growth rates, while limiting expense 

growth to achieve average annual cash operating leverage (defined 
as the difference between the revenue and cash-based expense 

growth rates) of at least 1.5% over time. In managing our operations, 

we balance current profitability with the need to invest in our 

businesses for future growth.
The Our Financial Objectives section above and the Enterprise-Wide Strategy and Economic Developments sections that follow cont
ain certain forward-looking 
statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and un
certainties. Please refer to the 
Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 29 of this MD&A for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties and the m
aterial factors and assumptions
 related to the statements set forth in such sections.
Our VisionTo be the bank that defines great customer experience.
Our Guiding PrincipleWe aim to maximize total shareholder return and balance 

our commitments to financial perf
ormance, our customers, our 
employees, the environment and the communities where we 

live and work.
Our Medium-Term Financial Objectives
Over time, increase EPS by an average of 12% per year, 

earn average annual ROE of between 17% and 20%, achieve 

average annual cash operating leverage of at least 1.5%, 
and maintain strong capital ratios that meet both current 
and expected regulatory requirements.

28 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&ACaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Bank of Montreal’s public communications often include written or oral forward-looking statements. Statements of this type are included in this Annual Report, and may be included in other filings 
with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or in other communications. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of, and 
are intended to be forward-looking statements under, the United States 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements
 may involve, but are not limited to, comments with respect to ou
r objectives and priorities for 2011 and beyond, our strategies
 or future actions, our targets, expectations for our financial condition 
or share price, and the results of or outlook for our 
operations or for the Canadian and U.S. economies.
 By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties
. There is significant risk that predictions, forecasts, conclusions or 
projections will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct and that actual results may differ materiall
y from such predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections. We caution 
readers of this Annual Report not to place undue reliance on 
our forward-looking statements as a number of factors could cause 
actual future results, conditions, actions or events to differ materially 
from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements.

 The future outcomes that relate to forward-looking statements may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to:
 general economic and market conditions in the countries in 
which we operate; weak, volatile or illiquid capital and/or credit markets; interest rate and currency value fluctuations; chan
ges in monetary, fiscal or economic policy; the degree of competition 
in the geographic and business areas in which we operate; change
s in laws or in supervisory expectations or requirements, including capital and liquidity requirements and guidance; judicial 
or regulatory proceedings; the accuracy and completeness of the information we obtain with respect to our customers and counter
parties; our ability to execute our strategic plans and to complete 
and integrate acquisitions; critical accounting estimates; operational and infrastructure risks; general political conditions; 
global capital markets activities; the possible effects on our business of 
war or terrorist activities; disease or illness that affects local, national or international economies; disruptions to public 
infrastructure, such as transportation, communications, power or water supply; 

and technological changes.

 We caution that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all 
possible factors. Other factors could adversely affect our results
. For more information, please see the discussion below, which outlines 
in detail certain key factors that may affect Bank of Montreal’s future results. When relying on forward-looking statements to 
make decisions with respect to Bank of Montreal, investors and 
others should carefully consider these factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertain
ty of forward-looking statements. Bank of Montreal does not undertake 
to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by the organization or on
 its behalf, except as required by law. The forward-looking 
information contained in this document is presented for the purpo
se of assisting our shareholder
s in understanding our financia
l position as at and for the pe
riods ended on the dates presented, 
as well as our strategic priorities and objectives, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.
 In calculating the pro-forma impact of Basel III on our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios, and risk-weighted asset
s (including Counterparty Credit Risk and Market Risk), we have assumed 
our interpretation of the proposed rules announced by the Basel Co
mmittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as of this date and our
 models used to assess those requirements are consistent with the final 
requirements that will be promulgated by BCBS and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). We 
have also assumed that the proposed changes affecting capital deductions, 
risk-weighted assets, the regulatory capital treatment for non-common share capital instruments (i.e. grandfathered capital ins
truments) and the minimum regulatory capital ratios are adopted 
as proposed by BCBS and OSFI. We also assumed that existing capital instruments that are non-Basel III compliant but are Basel 
II compliant can be fully included in the October 31, 2010 pro-forma 
calculations. The full impact of the Basel III proposals has been 
quantified based on our financial and risk positions at year 
end or as close to year end as was practical. The Basel rules are not yet finalized 
and are subject to change, which may impact the results of our an
alysis. In setting out the expectation that we will be able to
 refinance certain capital instruments in the future, as and when necessary 
to meet regulatory capital requirements, we have assumed that 
factors beyond our control, includi
ng the state of the economic a
nd capital markets environment, will not impair our ability to do so. 
 Assumptions about the level of asset sales, expected asset sale prices, net funding cost, credit quality and risk of default a
nd losses on default of the under
lying assets of the structured 
investment vehicles were material factors we considered when 
establishing our expectations regarding the structured investment 
vehicles discussed in this document, including the amount to be 
drawn under the BMO liquidity facilities, whether consolidation 
will be required and the expectation that the first-loss protec
tion provided by the subordinate capital notes will exceed future losses. 
Key assumptions included that assets would continue to be sold with a view to reducing the size of the structured investment ve
hicles, under various asset price scenarios, and that the level of 
defaults and losses will be consistent with the credit quality 
of the underlying assets and our current expectations regarding 
continuing difficult market conditions. In determining amounts of asset 
maturities by year, we made assumptions as to which issuers 
will redeem subordinated debt prior to its maturity date, where per
mitted.
 Assumptions about the level of defaults and losses on defaults were material factors we considered when establishing our expec
tations of the future performance of the transactions that 
Apex Trust has entered into. Among the key assumptions were that the level of defaults and losses on defaults would be consiste
nt with historical experience. Material factors that were taken into 
account when establishing our expectations of the future risk of credit losses in Apex Trust and risk of loss to BMO included industry diversification in the portfolio, initial credit quality by portfolio, 

the first-loss protection incorporated into the st
ructure and the hedges that BMO has entered into. 
 Our expectations regarding the key impacts of our transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are based on IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) that are in effect as of this date. Should IFRS change prio
r to our transition to IFRS, our expectations of the key impa
cts of transition could change.
 Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2011 and how that will affect our businesses were mate
rial factors we considered when setting our strategic priorities 
and objectives, and our outlook for our businesses. Key assumptions included that the Canadian and U.S. economies will grow mod
erately in 2011, that interest rates will remain low and that 
our assumptions regarding regulatory reforms will be consistent with the implementation of such reforms. We also assumed that h
ousing markets will strengthen in Canada and the United States. 
We assumed that conditions in capital markets will improve somewhat and that the Canadian dollar will strengthen modestly relat
ive to the U.S. dollar. In determining our expectations for 
economic growth, both broadly and in the financial services sect
or, we primarily consider historical economic data provided by 
the Canadian and U.S. governments and their agencies.
Factors That May Affect Future Results
As noted in the above Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, 
all forward-looking statements and information, by their nature, are 

subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, 

which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expecta-

tions expressed in any forward-looking statements. The Enterprise-Wide 

Risk Management section starting on page 75 describes a number of 

risks, including credit and counterparty, market, liquidity and funding, 

insurance, operational, business, model, strategic, reputation and 

environmental risks. The sections that follow outline some additional 

risks and uncertainties.
General Economic and Market Conditions in the Countries 
in which We Conduct Business

We conduct business in Canada, the United States and other countries. 

Factors such as the general health of capital markets, including liquidity, 

level of activity, volatility and stability, could have a material impact on 

our business. As well, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, consumer 
spending, business investment, government spending, the rate of inflation 
and the threat of terrorism affect the business and economic environ-
ments in which we operate. Therefore,
 the amount of business we conduct 
in a specific geographic region and its local economic and business con-

ditions may have an effect on our revenues and earnings. For example, 

a regional economic decline may result in an increase in credit losses, 

a decrease in loan growth and reduced capital markets activity.
Fiscal and Monetary Policy

Our earnings are affected by fiscal, monetary and economic policies 

that are adopted by Canadian, U.S. and other regulatory authorities. 

Such policies can have the effect of reducing competition and increasing 

uncertainty in the markets. As well, bond and money market expecta-
tions about inflation and central bank monetary policy have an impact on
 the level of interest rates. Changes in market expectations and monetary 

policy are difficult to anticipate and predict. Fluctuations in interest 
rates that result from these changes can have an impact on our earnings. 
Refer to the Market Risk section on pages 82 to 85 for a more complete 
discussion of our interest rate risk exposures.
Level of Competition
The level of competition among financial services companies is 
high. Furthermore, non-financial companies have increasingly been 

offering services traditionally provided by banks. Customer loyalty 
and retention can be influenced by a number of factors, including service
 levels, prices for products or service
s, our reputation 
and the actions 
of our competitors. Also, laws and regulations enacted by regulatory 
authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which 
we operate may provide benefits to our international competitors 
that could impact our ability to compete. Changes in these factors 

or a loss of market share could adversely affect our earnings.
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 29MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&ACurrency Rates
The Canadian dollar equivalents of our revenues and expenses 

denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar are subject 

to fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to those 

currencies. Refer to the Foreign Exchange section on page 36 and the 

Market Risk section on pages 82 to 85 for a more complete discussion 

of our foreign exchange risk exposures. 
Changes in Laws, Regulations and Approach to Supervision
Regulations are in place to protect our clients, investors and the public 

interest. Considerable changes in laws and regulations that relate to the 

financial industry have been proposed, including changes related to 

capital and liquidity requirements. Changes in laws and regulations, 

including how they are interpreted and enforced, and in approaches to 

supervision could adversely affect our 
earnings, for example by limiting 
the products or services we can provide and the manner in which we 

provide them and by increasing the costs of compliance. The changes 
could also affect the levels of capital and liquidity we choose to maintain. 
In particular, the Basel III global standards for capital and liquidity, which 

are discussed in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section that 

starts on page 59, and enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act
, which is discussed in the U.S. Regulatory 

Developments section on page 67, may have an impact on our results 

or activities. Liquidity and funding risk is discussed starting on page 85. 
In addition to the factors outlined, our failure to comply with laws 

and regulations could result in sanctions and financial penalties that 

could adversely affect our reputation and earnings.
Judicial or Regulatory Judgments and Legal 

and Regulatory Proceedings

We take reasonable measures to comply with the laws and regulations 
of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Should these measures
 prove not to be effective, it is possible that we could be subject to 

a judicial or regulatory judgment or decision which results in fines, 

damages or other costs that would have a negative impact on earnings 

and damage our reputation. We are also subject to litigation arising 

in the ordinary course of our business. The unfavourable resolution of 

any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial 

results. Damage to our reputation could also result, harming our future 

business prospects. Information about certain legal and regulatory 

matters we currently face is provided in Note 28 on page 159 of the 

financial statements.
Execution of Strategy
Our financial performance is influenced by our ability to execute strategic
 plans developed by management. If these strategic plans do not meet 
with success or if there is a change in these strategic plans, our earnings 

could grow at a slower pace or decline. In addition, our ability to execute 
our strategic plans is dependent to a large extent on our ability to 

attract, develop and retain key executives, and there is no assurance 

we will continue to do so successfully. 
Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with Canadian 

generally accepted accounting princ
iples (GAAP). The application of GAAP 
requires that management make significant judgments and estimates 
that can affect when certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
are recorded in our financial statements and their recorded values. In 

making these judgments and estimates, we rely on the best information 

available at the time. However, it is possible that circumstances may 

change or new information may become available. Our financial results 
would be affected in the period in which any new circumstances or 
information became apparent, and the amount of the impact could be 
significant. More information is included in the discussion of Critical 
Accounting Estimates on page 68.
We are required to adopt IFRS commencing November 1, 2011. 
Further discussion on the impact is included on pages 70 to 73.
Acquisitions
We conduct thorough due diligence before completing an acquisition. 
However, it is possible that we might make an acquisition that 
subsequently does not perform in line with our financial or strategic 

objectives. Changes in the competitive and economic environment 
as well as other factors may lower revenues, while higher than anticipated 
integration costs and failure to realize expected cost savings could 
also adversely affect our earnings after an acquisition. Our post-acquisition 
performance is also contingent on retaining the clients and key 
employees of acquired companies, and there can be no assurance 

that we will always succeed in doing so.
Accuracy and Completeness of Customer 

and Counterparty Information
When deciding to extend credit or enter into other transactions 
with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information provided 
by or on behalf of those customers and counterparties, including 
audited financial statements and other financial information. We also 

may rely on representations made by customers and counterparties 

that the infor 
mation they provide is accurate and complete. Our financial 
results could be adversely affected if the financial statements or 

other financial information provided by customers and counterparties 

is materially misleading.
Operational and Infrastructure Risks

We are exposed to many of the operational risks that affect all large 

corporations. Such risks include the risk of fraud by employees or others, 

unauthorized transactions by employees, and operational or human 

error. We also face the risk that computer or telecommunications 

systems could fail, despite our efforts to maintain these systems in good 
working order. Given the high volume of transactions we process on a 
daily basis, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they 
are discovered and rectified. Shortcomings or failures of our internal 
processes, employees or systems, or those provided by third parties, 
including any of our financial, accounting or other data processing 
systems, could lead to financial loss and damage to our reputation. 

In addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our 
ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption 

in the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities 

in which we do business, including disruption caused by pandemics 

or terrorist acts.
Other Factors
Other factors beyond our control that may affect our future results are 

noted in the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 29. 
We caution that the preceding discussion of factors that may 
affect future results is not exhaustive. When relying on forward-looking 
statements to make decisions with respect to BMO, investors and others 
should carefully consider these factors, as well as other uncertainties, 
potential events and industry and company-specific factors that may 
adversely affect future results. We do not undertake to update any 
forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made 
from time to time by us or on our 
behalf, except as required by law.
30 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&ACanadian and U.S. Economic and Financial Services 
Developments in 2010
After contracting in 2009, the Canadian economy grew by an estimated 
2.9% in 2010. Consumer spending and business investment have led 
the recovery, supported by very low interest rates. Housing markets were
 strong early in the year, supporting mortgage growth, but weakened 
in response to modest increases in interest rates and tighter mortgage 

insurance rules. The trade sector continued to restrain economic 
growth. While exports were strong early in 2010 due to improved global 
demand, imports rose even faster, reflecting solid domestic spending and 
the strong Canadian dollar. Employment recovered faster than expected 

in 2010, supporting consumer spending and personal credit growth. 

However, personal deposit growth slowed, as an increase in investors’ 

risk tolerance redirected savings towa
rd equity mutual funds. Businesses 
continued to finance spending from cash flow and new bond issuances, 

limiting business credit demand. However, business deposit growth 

remained solid due to strong growth in profits and the uncertain 
invest-
ment climate. Although inflation remained low, the Bank of Canada
 raised its overnight rate target several times from record low levels, as 
the economy no longer required significant stimulus. However, the 
Bank did not raise rates in October in light of slowing economic growth.
The U.S. economy grew by an estimated 2.8% in 2010 after 
contracting in 2009. Inventory rebuilding and fiscal incentives drove 

the recovery early in the year, but growth slowed when the incentives 
ended. Consumer spending has grown modestly, as households continued
 to save more of their income to pay down debt, and personal credit 

continued to contract. Housing demand weakened sharply following 

the expiry of the homebuyer tax credit in the spring, and commercial 

construction was hampered by high vacancy rates. Deep cutbacks at 

the state and local levels largely offset increases in federal government 
spending. While business spending on equipment and machinery 
remained exceptionally strong, private-sector hiring has remained weak 

due to uncertainty about the economy and health care costs. The Federal 
Reserve has maintained a near-zero rate policy and recently expanded 
its asset purchases to 
support the economy. In the Midwest, where the 
bulk of our U.S. operations are located, the economy continued to grow 

modestly, benefiting from strong export sales and an upswing in auto 

production but held back by weak housing markets.
Economic and Financial Services Outlook for 2011
The Canadian economy is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2011, supported by 
still-low interest rates and firm
er commodity prices. The unemployment 

rate should decline slightly to 7.7% by year end. Growth in residential 
mortgages and personal credit will likely be moderate relative to 2010. 
Business credit demand should improve in response to continued 

strong investment spending. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise 
interest rates only slightly in 2011, pausing for extended periods to 

assess the still uncertain global outlook. Supported by higher interest 

rates and firm commodity prices, the Canadian dollar is expected to 
rise above parity with the U.S. dollar in 2011. The resource-producing 
Western provinces will likely lead the recovery again next year.
The U.S. and U.S. Midwest economies are projected to grow 
moderately in 2011, improving as housing markets stabilize and credit 

standards ease. Healthier business balance sheets should encourage 
growth in capital spending and employment, supporting consumer spend-
ing. Demand for business and personal credit and residential mortgages 
should strengthen next year. In a subdued inflation climate, the Federal 
Reserve will likely not raise interest rates until 2012. Capital markets 

are expected to strengthen as the recovery broadens and business 

confidence improves.

Value Measures
Total Shareholder Return
The five-year average annual TSR is a key measure of shareholder 
value and is the most important of our financial performance and 
condition measures, since it assesses our success in achieving our guiding
principle of maximizing return to shar
eholders. Over the past five years, 
shareholders have earned an average annual TSR of 5.9% on their 

investment in BMO common shares. The average was suppressed by 

the low valuations in the difficult equity market conditions of 2008, 

as annual returns have exceeded 20% in three of the past five years. 
The five-year average annual return was lower than the 7.0% average 
annual return for the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index, but 

higher than the 5.0% return for the S&P/TSX Financial Services Total 
Return Index and the 1.7% return for the S&P 500 Total Return Index. 
The one-year return was strong, at 26.4%, and was higher than the 

comparable indices.
The table below summarizes dividends paid on BMO common 
shares over the past five years and the movements in BMO’s share 
price. An investment of $1,000 in Bank of Montreal common shares 

made at the beginning of fiscal 2006 would have been worth $1,333 at 

October 31, 2010, assuming reinvestment of dividends, for a total return 

of 33.3%. We maintained our dividend payments at $0.70 per common 

share in each quarter of 2010, consistent with 2009. Dividends paid 

over five-year and ten-year periods have increased at average annual 

compound rates of 9.2% and 11.0%, respectively.
The average annual TSR of 5.9% for the most recent five-year 
period improved from the 1.8% average annual return for the five years 

ended October 31, 2009. The averages are affected by each one-year 

TSR included in the calculations.
The five-year average annual total shareholder return (TSR) 
represents the average annual total return earned on an 
investment in BMO common shares made at the beginning 
of a five-year period. The return includes the change in share 
price and assumes that dividends received were reinvested 
in additional common shares. The one-year TSR also assumes 
that dividends were reinvested in shares.

Highlights
•  Total shareholder return (TSR) 
Œ Our one-year TSR in 2010 was 
a strong 26.4%, well above the comparable indices. Low equity 
valuations in 2008 reduced the average annual return over the 
past five years to 5.9%. 
•  Earnings per share (EPS) growth 
Œ EPS grew 54% from 2009 as 
net income rose significantly. Market conditions improved, resulting 
in strong revenue growth and lower provisions for credit losses. 

There was a modest increase in expenses and a higher effective 
income tax rate. The average number of common shares 

outstanding increased, primarily due to our 2010 dividend 

reinvestment program. 
•Net income was up 57%, rising by more than $1 billion to $2.8 bil 
lion. 
P&C Canada and Private Client Group recorded 
strong net income, 
with results up appreciably from 2009. Corporate Services also 

recorded significantly improved results, with higher revenues and 

lower provisions for credit losses. 
•  Return on equity (ROE) was 14.9% in 2010, up from 9.9% in 2009 

due to increased net income. BMO has achieved an ROE of 13% 

or better in 20 of the past 21 years, one of only two banks in our 

North American peer group to have done so.
•  We maintained our dividend payments at $2.80 per common 

share in 2010, in light of the financial environment and uncer-

tainty regarding pending changes in the rules governing capital 

adequacy. Dividends paid per common share over five-year 
and ten-year periods have increased at average annual compound
rates of 9.2% and 11.0%, respectively.
32BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AEarnings per Share Growth
Earnings per share (EPS)
 is calculated by dividing net income, 
after deduction of preferred dividends, by the average number 
of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS, which is our basis 
for measuring performance, adjusts for possible conversions 
of financial instruments into common shares if those conversions 

would reduce EPS, and is more fully explained in Note 25 on 

page 156 of the financial statements. 
The year-over-year percentage change in earnings per share (EPS) is 
our key measure for analyzing earnings growth. All references to EPS 

are to diluted EPS, unless indicated otherwise. 
EPS was 
$4.75, up $1.67 or 54% from $3.08 in 2009. Certain notable 
items affected results in 2009, reducing EPS by $0.88. There were no 

notable items in 2010.
Our five-year compound average annual EPS growth rate was 0.5%, 
well below our current medium-term objective of growing EPS by an 
average of 12% over time. Net income available to common shareholders
 was 13% higher than in the 2005 base year, while the average number 
of diluted common shares outstanding increased by 10% over the same 
period as we chose to bolster capital levels.
The notable items that reduced net income in 2009 by $474 million 
or $0.88 per share were:
• charges for certain trading activities and valuation adjustments related 
to the deterioration in capital markets of $521 million ($355 million 

after tax or $0.66 per share) recorded in BMO Capital Markets; 
• severance costs of $118 million ($80 million after tax or $0.15 per 
share) recorded in Corporate Services; and
• an increase in the general allowance for credit losses of $60 million 
($39 million after tax or $0.07 per share) recorded in Corporate Services. 
Notable items are discussed further on page 36.

Net income was $2,810 million in 2010, up $1,023 million or 57% 
from $1,787 million a year ago. There was strong revenue growth and a 

significant decrease in provisions for credit losses. There was moderate 

expense growth and a higher effective income tax rate. 
Revenue increased $1,146 million or 10% to $12,210 million. 
The weaker U.S. dollar reduced revenue growth by $365 million, 
while acquired businesses added $214 million to growth. P&C Canada 
revenue increased $543 million or 10%; P&C U.S. revenue increased 

US$25 million or 2%; Private Client Group revenue increased $233 million 

or 12%; and BMO Capital Markets revenue increased $190 million or 

6%. Corporate Services revenue was substantially higher than in 2009. 

Revenue is discussed further on page 37.
Provisions for credit losses totalled $1,049 million, consisting 
entirely of specific provisions. In 2009, provisions for credit losses totalled 
$1,603 million, consisting of $1,543 million of specific provisions and 

a $60 million increase in the general allowance. The provision for credit 

losses is discussed further on page 40. 
Non-interest expense increased $209 million or 3% to $7,590 million. 
The weaker U.S. dollar reduced expenses by $213 million, while acquired 
businesses increased expenses by $152 million. Non-interest expense 

is discussed further on page 41.
Income before provisions for credit losses, income taxes and non-
controlling interest in subsidiaries
(1) rose $937 million to $4,620 million.
The effective income tax rate was 19.2% in 2010, up from 10.5% 
in 2009, as we earned a lower proportion of income in lower-tax-rate 
jurisdictions in 2010. The provision for income taxes is discussed 
further on page 42. 
Personal and Commercial Banking results in 2010 continued to show 
strong growth and Private Client Group net income was up sig 
nificantly. 
Corporate Services results were also appreciably improved from 2009.
Personal and Commercial Banking (P&C) net income rose 
$118 million or 7% from a year ago to $1,819 million. The P&C group 
combines our two retail and business banking operating segments, 

Personal and Commercial Banking Canada (P&C Canada) and Personal 
and Commercial Banking U.S. (P&C U.S.). P&C Canada net income 
rose by $229 million or 16% to $1,644 million. The improvement was 
attributable to volume-driven revenue growth and improved net 
interest margin. P&C Canada results are discussed in the operating group 

review on page 45. P&C U.S. net income decreased $111 million or 39% 

to $175 million, but decreased $75 million or 31% to $168 million on a 

U.S. dollar basis. On a basis that adjusts for the impact of impaired loans, 

changes in the Visa litigation accrual and acquisition integration costs, 

net income was US$237 million, down US$50 million or 17% from a year 

ago on a comparably-adjusted basis. P&C U.S. results are discussed in 

the operating group review on page 48. 
Private Client Group (PCG) net income increased $111 million or 
31% to $470 million. The increase was largely attributable to revenue 
growth in all of PCG’s businesses related to growth in client assets 

under management and administration, as well as higher insurance 

premiums, including the benefit of a full year’s results from the BMO Life 

Assurance acquisition that occurred late in the second quarter of 2009. 

PCG results are discussed in the operating group review on page 51.
BMO Capital Markets (BMO CM) net income decreased $53 million 
or 6% to $820 million. There was increased revenue, largely due 
to increased investment securities gains, higher provisions for credit 
losses, modest expense growth and a higher effective income tax 
rate. Trading revenues decreased. There were also lower revenues 
from our interest-rate-sensitive businesses, which had benefited 

from favourable market spreads in the prior year, and corporate banking 

revenues were lower, primarily due to reduced asset levels. Mergers 

and acquisitions and debt underwriting fees improved considerably. 

BMO CM results are discussed in the operating group review on page 54. 
Corporate Services net loss decreased $847 million to $299 million 
due to improved revenues and lower provisions for credit losses 

recorded in Corporate Services under BMO’s expected loss provisioning 

methodology. This methodology and Corporate Services’ results are 

discussed in the operating group review on page 57.

NEP improved significantly as 

earnings available to common 

shareholders rose by more than 

$1 billion.
Return on Equity
Return on equity (ROE) is another key value measure. ROE was 14.9% 
in 2010, compared with 9.9% in 2009. The improvement was primarily 

attributable to an increase of more than $1 billion in earnings available 
to common shareholders. Average common shareholders’ equity increased
 $1 billion from 2009. In 2009 and 2010, we decided to strengthen 
equity and associated capital ratios to support investors’ and depositors’ 
confidence and provide greater operational and strategic flexibility. 
The increase in equity has contributed to our ROE falling short of our 
historic returns and medium-term objectives. BMO has achieved an 
ROE of 13% or better in 20 of the past 21 years, one of only two banks 

in our North American peer group to have done so. We fell short of 
that standard in the difficult economic environment in 2009. As in 2009, 

our ROE in 2010 compared favourably with our global peers. Our medium-

term objective is to achieve an average annual ROE of 17% to 20%, over 

time. Table 3 on page 97 includes ROE statistics for the past 10 years.
Net Economic Profit Growth
The last of our four key value measures is net economic profit (NEP)
(1) growth. NEP was $818 million, up from a loss of $68 million in the prior 

year. The improvement was attributable to a significant increase in 

earnings, net of a higher charge for capital as a result of the increase 

in shareholders’ equity. Earnings av
ailable to common shareholders 
rose by more than $1 billion in 2010.
Return on common 

shareholders’ equity (ROE)
 is calculated as net income, 

less preferred dividends, 

as a percentage of average 
common shareholders’ equity. 

Common share 
holders’ equity 
is comprised of common 

share capital, contributed 

surplus, accumulated other 

comprehensive income 

(loss) and retained earnings.
Net economic profit (NEP)
 represents cash net income 

available to common share-

holders, less a charge for 

capital. NEP is an effective 

measure of economic value 

added. NEP is a non-GAAP 

measure. See page 91.

MD&A2010 Financial Performance Review
Highlights
•  The provision for credit losses fell to $1,049 million from 
$1,603 mil 
lion in 2009. Specific provisions were down $494 million 
to $1,049 million and there was no increase in the general 
allowance, compared with a $60 million increase a year ago. 
Credit market conditions have improved but remain challenging.
•  Non-interest expense increased 3% in 2010. The increase was 
attributable to acquired businesses, higher performance-based com-
pensation in line with improved results, and higher technology
costs and initiative spending to support our businesses. The weaker
U.S. dollar reduced expense growth by 2.9 percentage points.
•  The effective income tax rate was 19.2%, compared with a rate of 

10.5% in 2009. The higher rate in 2010 was mainly attributable to 

proportionately lower income from lower-tax-rate jurisdictions.
This section provides a review of our enterprise financial performance for 2010 that focuses on the Consolidated Statement of Income included in 

our consolidated financial statements, which begin on page 110. 
A review of our operating groups’ strategies and performance follows the enterprise 
review. A summary of the enterprise financial performance for 2009 appears on page 92.
Impact of Business Acquisitions
BMO Financial Group has selectively acquired a number of businesses. 

These acquisitions increase revenues and expenses, affecting year-
over-year comparisons of operating results. The adjacent table outlines 
acquisitions by operating group and their incremental impact on BMO’s 

revenues, expenses (excluding acquisition integration costs) and 
net income for 2010 relative to 2009 and 2009 relative to 2008, to assist 

in analyzing changes in results. The impact on net income includes 

the impact of provisions for credit losses and income taxes, which are 

not disclosed separately in the table.
In respect of fiscal 2010 results relative to fiscal 2009, for the acqui-
sitions completed in fiscal 2010, the incremental effects are the revenues 

and expenses of those businesses that are included in results for fiscal 

2010. For the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2009, the incremental 

effects on results for 2010 relate to the inclusion of 12 months of results 

in 2010 and a lesser number of months in 2009.
In respect of fiscal 2009 results relative to fiscal 2008, for the 
acquisitions completed in fiscal 2009, the incremental effects are the 

revenues and expenses of those businesses that are included in results 
for fiscal 2009. For the acquisitions completed in fiscal 2008, the 
incremental effects on results for 2009 relate to the inclusion of 
12 months of results in 2009 and a lesser number of months in 2008.

•  Revenue increased $1,146 million or 10% in 2010 to $12.2 billion, 
following growth of 8% in 2009 and 9% in 2008. This consistently 

high rate of revenue growth demonstrates the benefit of our 
diversified business mix in market conditions that have been 
challenging at times.
•  Revenue growth of $543 million or 10% in P&C Canada was 

primarily attributable to volume growth in most products, an 

improved net interest margin and the impact of the inclusion of 

the Diners Club North American franchise results in the current 

year. The other operating groups also made significant contributions, 

with strong revenue growth in Corporate Services and revenue 

growth of 12% in Private Client Group, 6% in BMO Capital Markets 

and 2% in P&C U.S. on a U.S. dollar basis.

 35MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AForeign Exchange
The U.S. dollar was weaker at October 31, 2010 than at October 31, 2009, 
and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end rates. The average 

exchange rate over the course of 2010 is used for translation of revenues 
and expenses in 2010 and, while the U.S. dollar also weakened on 
this basis, it strengthened in 2009 relative to 2008. The Canadian dollar 

equivalents of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated net income, revenues, 

expenses, income taxes and provision for credit losses in 2010 were 
reduced relative to the preceding year by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
The adjacent table indicates average Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange 

rates in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and the impact of changes in the average 

rates. At October 31, 2010, the Canadian dollar traded at $1.020 per 

U.S. dollar. It traded at $1.082 per U.S. dollar at October 31, 2009.
At the start of each quarter, BMO assesses whether to enter into 
hedging transactions that are designed to partially offset the pre-tax 

effects of exchange rate fluctuations in the quarter on our expected U.S.-

dollar-denominated net income for that quarter. As such, these activities 

partially mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, but only 

within that quarter. As a result, the sum of the hedging gains/losses for 

the four quarters in a year is not directly comparable to the impact of 

year-over-year exchange rate fluctuations on earnings for the year. 

Hedging transactions resulted in an after-tax gain of $5 million in 2010 

($1 million loss in 2009).
The gain or loss from hedging transactions in future periods will be 
determined by both future exchange rate fluctuations and the amount 

of the underlying future hedging transa
ctions, since the transactions are 
entered into each quarter in relation to expected U.S.-dollar-denominated
 net income for the next three months. The effect of exchange rate 

fluctuations on our net investment in foreign operations is discussed 

in the Provision for Income Taxes section on page 42.
BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated results are affected, favourably 
or unfavourably, by movements in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange 

rate. Rate movements affect future results measured in Canadian 

dollars and the impact on results is a function of the periods in which 

revenues, expenses and provisions for credit losses arise. If future 

results are con 
sistent with the range of results for the past three years, 
each one cent decrease in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate, 

expressed in terms of how many Canadian dollars one U.S. dollar buys, 

would be expected to change the Canadian dollar equivalents of U.S.-

dollar-denominated net income (loss) before income taxes by between 

–$6 million and $10 million. An increase of one cent would have the 

opposite effect.

Please see the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
We have designated certain charges as notable items to assist in 

discussing their impact on our financial results. There were no items 

designated as notable in 2010.
These items reduced net income by $474 million in 2009 and 
$426 million in 2008, as set out in the adjacent table. Charges in 2009 

and 2008 include amounts related to BMO’s investment in Apex Trust, 

a Canadian credit protection vehicle. In the latter half of 2009, we 

put in place hedges that reduced BMO’s risk exposure on Apex to levels 

that are not expected to expose BMO to significant loss. In 2010, the total 

mark-to-market losses on the exposu
re, net of hedging, were nominal, 
at less than $10 million pre-tax.
In 2009, revenue was reduced by charges of $521 million related 
to Apex. These charges reduced trading non-interest revenues by 

$344 million and securities gains by $177 million.
In 2008, revenue was reduced by charges of $388 million in respect 
of the capital markets environment, including charges of $230 million 
related to Apex and $158 million in respect of exiting positions related 
to the monoline insurer ACA Financial Guarantee Corporation. These 
charges reduced trading non-interest revenues by $258 million and 
securities gains by $130 million.

Revenue
Taxable equivalent basis (teb)
 Revenues of operating groups 
reflected in our MD&A are presented on a taxable equivalent 
basis (teb). The teb adjustment increases GAAP revenues and 

the provision for income taxes by an amount that would increase 

revenues on certain tax-exempt securities to a level that would 

incur tax at the statutory rate, to facilitate comparisons.
Revenue increased $1,146 million or 10% in 2010 to $12,210 mil 
lion. There 
was solid revenue growth in each of the operating groups except P&C U.S., 
where revenues were modestly higher on a U.S. dollar
 basis. Revenues 
in BMO Capital Markets in 2009 were elevated by favourable market 

conditions but were lowered by a charge of 
$521 million related to the 
impact of the difficult capital markets environment.
 There were no such 
charges in 2010. The weaker U.S. dollar lowered overall revenue growth 
by $365 million or 3.3 percentage points, while the net impact of acquired
 businesses increased growth by $214 million or 1.9 percentage points.
BMO analyzes revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP 
revenues reflected in the financial statements rather than on a taxable 

equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian peer group. 

Like many banks, we continue to analyze revenue on a teb basis at 

the operating group level. The teb adjustments for fiscal 2010 totalled 

$355 million, up from $247 million in 2009. 
P&C Canada revenue increased $543 million or 10%. The segment’s 
revenue growth was driven by volume growth in most products, 
improved net interest margin and the inclusion of ten months of revenues
 from the Diners Club acquired business. P&C U.S. revenue increased 

US$25 million or 1.8%. Adjusting for the impact of the acquisition of cer-

tain assets and liabilities of AMCORE Bank, N.A., a Rockford, 
Illinois-based 
bank, and the impact of impaired loans, revenue decreased US$27 million
 or 2.0% as the effect of loan spread improvement was more than 

offset by a decrease in commercial loan balances related to lower client 

utilizations, as well as deposit spread compression. Private Client Group 

revenue increased $233 million or 12%, reflecting revenue growth 

across all of its businesses. The improvement in equity market conditions 

for most of the year increased the group’s assets under management 
and administration and associated fee-based revenues. Insurance revenue 
increased due to higher premiums and the inclusion of a full year’s 

results of the BMO Life Assurance acquisition, partially offset by the 

effects of unfavourable market movements. BMO Capital Markets 

revenue increased $190 million or 6% from results in 2009 that were 

lowered by the charge outlined above. Investment securities gains 

increased. Mergers and acquisitions fees and debt underwriting fees 

also improved but revenues from interest-rate-sensitive businesses and 

corporate lending and trading revenue fell in the more difficult market 

conditions. Corporate Services revenues were significantly higher due to 

more stable market conditions and management actions.
For the third consecutive year, there was solid growth in both BMO 
net interest income and non-interest revenue.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income for the year was $6,235 million, an increase of 

$665 million or 12% from 2009. The net effect of businesses acquired 
increased net interest income by $24 million, while the impact of 

the weaker U.S. dollar decreased net interest income by $210 million. 

The bank’s average earning assets decreased $9.4 billion, but increased 
Net interest income
 is comprised of earnings on assets, such 
as loans and securities, including interest and dividend income 
and BMO’s share of income from investments accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting, less interest expense 

paid on liabilities, such as deposits.

Net interest margin
 is the ratio of net interest income to 

earning assets, expressed as a percentage or in basis points.

5,975 5,494 5,133 481 9$4.1 billion excluding the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Asset levels 
were reduced in BMO Capital Markets and P&C U.S., due in part to the 
weaker U.S. dollar, but there were solid increases in P&C Canada and 
Private Client Group. BMO’s overall net interest margin was up 25 basis 
points in 2010, driven primarily by higher margins in P&C Canada 
and improved net interest income in Corporate Services. The main drivers
 of BMO’s overall net interest margin are the individual group margins, 

changes in the magnitude of each operating group’s assets and changes 

in net interest income in Corporate Services.
P&C Canada recorded a solid increase in net interest income. 
Volume growth remained strong in all major product categories. 

Net interest margin increased 13 basis points, driven primarily by 
actions taken in 2009 to mitigate the impact of rising long-term funding 

costs, improvement in the spread on deposit products from unusually 

low levels a year ago and higher volumes in more-profitable products. 

In P&C U.S., net interest income fell, but increased on a U.S. dollar basis. 

The favourable effects of the Rockford, Illinois-based bank transaction 
and loan spread improvement more than offset the impact of impaired 
loans, the decrease in commercial loan balances caused by lower 
client utilizations, and deposit spread compression. P&C U.S. net interest 

margin rose significantly from 2009.
Private Client Group net interest income increased modestly. 
Volume growth in our brokerage and private banking businesses 
was partially offset by spread compression in our brokerage businesses. 
The group’s net interest margin decreased 53 basis points, with 

approximately 90% of the decrease due to the mid-2009 acquisition 

of BMO Life Assurance, which increased assets with no change to 
net interest income. 
BMO Capital Markets net interest income decreased $134 million 
or 9%. Revenues from interest-rate-sensitive businesses and corporate 

bank 
ing were lower, while trading net interest income was higher. 
The group’s average earning assets were reduced by $16.9 billion, 

including the $8.2 billion negative impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, due 

mainly to lower levels of money market and corporate lending assets. 

Net interest margin increased nominally as higher net interest income 

from trading assets was offset by lower spreads on money market 

and corporate lending assets. 
The improvement in Corporate Services net interest income was 
primarily due to a lower negative carry on certain asset-liability interest 
rate positions as a result of management actions and more stable market
 conditions, and the diminished impact in 2010 of funding activities in 

prior years that enhanced our strong liquidity position. 
Table 9 on page 100 and Table 10 on page 101 provide further details
 on net interest income and net interest margin. 
Non-Interest Revenue 
Non-interest revenue, which comprises all revenues other than net 
interest income, was $5,975 million in 2010, an increase of $481 million
 or 9% from 2009. Revenues in BMO Capital Markets in 2009 were elevated 

by favourable market conditions, but charges related to notable items 
reduced revenue in that year by $521 million, increasing year-over-year 
growth in 2010. The net impact of acquired businesses increased 2010 
non-interest revenue by $190 million, while the impact of the weaker 
U.S. dollar decreased non-interest revenue by $155 million.
Securities commissions and fees increased $75 million or 8%. 
These fees consist largely of full-service and online brokerage commis-
sions within Private Client Group, which account for about two-thirds 
of the total, and institutional equity trading commissions within BMO 
Capital Markets. The increase was largely due to increases in client 
trading volumes in Private Client Group, as equity market valuations 
were low in the first half of 2009 and activity levels were reduced.
Deposit and payment service charges decreased $18 million or 
2%, largely due to the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar on revenues in 

P&C U.S. and BMO Capital Markets.
Adjusting for the weaker 
U.S. dollar, earning assets 

increased with improved 

net interest margin. 
There was growth in 
institutional, personal and 

mutual fund assets under 

administration.
Growth reflects the number 

of new clients and stronger 

equity markets, offset in part 

by the weaker U.S. dollar.

section that follows.
Lending fees increased $16 million or 3% due to higher volumes, 
offset in part by the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.
Card fees increased $112 million to $233 million. The increase 
reflects volume growth, reduced securitization activity over the course 
of 2010 and the inclusion of ten months of the results of the Diners Club 

acquired business in the current year. 
Investment management and custodial fees increased $11 million 
or 3% due to stronger equity markets.
Mutual fund revenues improved markedly, growing by $83 million 
or 18%. Asset levels continued to reflect the growth that began in the 

second half of 2009, rising further over the course of the year. 
Securitization revenues decreased $251 million or 27%, reflecting a 
$91 million reduction from securitizing credit card loans and a $160 million
 reduction from securitizing residential mortgages. Revenues included 

gains of $68 million on the sales of loans for new securitizations, down 

$30 million from 2009, and gains of $428 million on sales of loans to 

revolving securitization vehicles, down $174 million from 2009. The 

securitization of assets results in the recognition of less interest income 

($507 million less in 2010), reduced credit card fees ($449 million less 

in 2010) and lower provisions for credit losses ($203 million less in 2010). 

As such, including securitization revenue of $678 million in 2010, the 

combined impact of securitizing assets in 2010 and prior years decreased 
pre-tax income by $75 million in 2010. We securitize loans primarily 
to obtain alternate sources of cost-effective funding. We securitized 
$4.3 billion of residential mortgage loans in 2010 and $6.8 billion in 

2009. Securitization revenues are detailed in Note 8 on page 126 of the 

financial statements.
Underwriting and advisory fees were $48 million or 12% higher 
than in 2010. Mergers and acquisitions fees and debt underwriting 

improved considerably, reflecting strong performance and improved 

market conditions. Equity underwriting fees decreased.
Securities gains were $150 million, improving from a net loss 
of $354 million in 2009. The notable items discussed on page 36 include 

charges recorded in securities gains (losses) in 2009 of $177 million 

related to the deterioration in the capital markets environment. 
Income from foreign exchange, other than trading, increased 
$40 million or 75%, reflecting growth in P&C Canada, Private Client Group
 and Corporate Services.
Insurance income increased $26 million or 9%, due in part to higher
 premiums and the inclusion of a full year’s results of BMO Life Assurance 
in 2010, partially offset by the effects of unfavourable market movements
 on policyholder liabilities.
Other revenue includes various sundry amounts and increased 
$54 million or 32%.
Table 7 on page 98 provides further details on revenue and 
revenue growth.
Trading-Related Revenues

Trading-related revenues are dependent on, among other things, the 

vo
lume of activities undertaken for clients who enter into transactions 
with BMO to mitigate their risks or to invest. BMO earns a spread 
or profit on the net sum of its client positions by profitably neutralizing, 
within prescribed limits, the overall risk of the net positions. BMO also 
assumes proprietary positions with the goal of earning trading profits.
Trading-related revenues
 include net interest income and non-
interest revenue earned from on and off-balance sheet positions 
undertaken for trading purposes. The management of these 
positions typically includes marking them to market on a daily 
basis. Trading-related revenues also include income (expense) 
and gains (losses) from both on-balance sheet instruments and 
off-balance sheet interest rate, foreign exchange (including 

spot positions), equity, commodity and credit contracts.
Although the North American economy improved in 2010 from the 
recession that affected much of 2009, our trading-related revenues were
 modestly lower than the levels of a year ago. Trading-related revenues 
were strong in 2009 as we were successful in taking advantage of market 
opportunities presented by high levels of market volatility. Conditions 
in 2010 were less favourable, with fewer market opportunities and a more
 difficult trading environment. The Notable Items section on page 36 

outlines charges related to deterioration in the capital markets environ-

ment that reduced trading-related revenues by $344 million and total 

revenue by $521 million in 2009. There were no similar charges in 2010. 
The Select Financial Instruments section, which starts on page 63, 
provides detailed information on certain instruments that markets had 
come to regard as carrying higher risk, certain of which resulted in 
charges that were designated as notable items in prior years.
Trading-related revenues decreased $57 million from 2009, showing 
strength in the first half of the ye
ar but softening in the latter half. 
Interest rate trading revenues were higher in 2010 but were weak in 

the third quarter. Other trading revenues increased, largely due to the 

improved impact of certain structural balance sheet and securitization-

related hedging activities. Equities trading revenue decreased from 

2009 mainly due to lower volatility in the current year, which provided 

fewer trading opportunities, as well as a fourth quarter 2010 reduction 

for accounting adjustments. Similarly, commodities trading revenue 

decreased from elevated levels in the prior year, which benefited from 

higher than usual customer flows. Foreign exchange markets in 2010 

experienced very thin spreads and lower volatility compared to 2009, 

resulting in a decline in foreign exchange trading revenue. 
The Market Risk section on page 82 provides more information 
on trading-related revenues.

Provision for Credit Losses
During 2010, we saw an improvement in the overall global economic 
environment, but conditions in some sectors remained challenging. 

This was particularly evident in the slower pace of recovery in the United 

States, most notably in the real estate sector, which faced continuing 

pressure. However, with an economic recovery underway and evidence 

of stabi 
lization in much of the credit market, we believe the overall 
improvement will continue into 2011, with some potential for variability.
BMO recorded $1,049 million of specific provisions for credit losses 
in the current year, with no change to the general allowance for credit 

losses. This compares to the $1,603 million provision recorded in 2009, 

which comprised specific provisions of $1,543 million and a $60 million 

increase in the general allowance. Provisions as a percentage of average 

net loans and acceptances decreased to 0.61% in 2010 from 0.88% in 

2009. The majority of our provisions continue to relate to our U.S. port-

folio, although we have seen an improving trend develop across both 

our Canadian and U.S. portfolios in 2010.
A significant factor influencing both provisions for credit losses and 
write-offs is the level of formations of new impaired loans 
Œ identified 
as additions to impaired loans and acceptances in the adjacent Changes 
in Gross Impaired Loans and Acceptances table. As with specific provisions
 and consistent with a year ago, impaired loan formations were well 

above the low levels of 2007 and 2006, but decreased to $1,525 million 
(excluding acquired impaired loans) in 2010 from a peak of $2,690 million
 in 2009. On a geographic basis, the United States again accounted for 

the majority of the impaired formations, with the commercial real estate 

and commercial mortgage sectors providing the largest contributions.
Gross impaired loans decreased to $3,221 million from $3,297 million
 in 2009. Gross impaired loans include an amount of $302 million (net 

$327 million acquired) related to the acquisition of a U.S.-based portfolio 

in an FDIC-assisted transaction. The loss sharing arrangement with the 

FDIC on this transaction indemnifies BMO against 80% of any losses on 

the acquired portfolio. Additional
 factors contributing to the change 
in impaired loans are outlined in the accompanying table. In 2010, sales 

of gross impaired loans totalled $29 million, with related reversals and 

recoveries of $9 million. This compares with sales of $97 million and 

related reversals and recoveries of $9 million in 2009.
The general allowance is maintained to cover impairment in 
the existing credit portfolio that cannot yet be associated with specific 

loans, and is assessed on a quarterly basis. The general allowance 
decreased $9 million from the prior fiscal year. While the general allowance 
was increased by our acquisition of the Diners Club business credit card 
receivables early in fiscal 2010, this was more than offset by the impact 
of the weaker U.S. dollar. The general allowance remains adequate 
and, as at October 31, 2010, represented 0.95% of credit risk-weighted 

assets. The total allowance for credit losses decreased $24 million 
in 2010 to $1,878 million (excluding a $9 million allowance included in 
Other Liabilities related to letters 
of credit that are considered Other 
Credit Instruments).
BMO’s loan book continues to comprise primarily the more stable 
consumer and commercial portfolios, which represented 86.2% of 
the loan portfolio at year end, an increase from 80% in 2009 mainly due 
to reduced levels of corporate loans. The consumer loans portfolio repre-

sents 56.6% of the portfolio, up from 53.9% in 2009, with approximately 

87.0% of the portfolio secured. The corporate and commercial loans port-

folio represents 43.4% of the portfolio, down from 46.1% in 2009. We 
continue to monitor industry sectors that we consider to be of concern, 
including real estate services, financial institutions and manufacturing. 
BMO’s exposure to sectors of concern remains within acceptable limits. 
Credit risk management is discussed further on page 80. Note 4 
on page 120 of the financial statements and Tables 11 to 19 on pages 
102 to 105 provide details of BMO’s loan portfolio, impaired loans and 

provisions and allowances for credit losses.

Expense growth (%) 
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $209 million or 2.8% to $7,590 million in 
2010. The factors contributing to the in
crease are set out in the adjacent 
Contribution to Non-Interest Expense Growth table. There were no notable
 items in 2010, but notable items in 2009 included severance costs that 
increased non-interest expense by $118 million.
As explained on page 35, the net effect of businesses acquired in 
2010 and 2009 increased expenses in 2010 relative to 2009 by $152 mil-

lion (2.1%). As further explained on page 36, the weaker U.S. dollar 

reduced costs in 2010 by $213 million (2.9%). Higher performance-based 

compensation costs increased expenses by $117 million (1.6%), in line 

with improved performance. 
The dollar and percentage changes in expenses by category are 
outlined in the adjacent Non-Interest Expense table. Table 8 on page 99 

provides more detail on expenses and expense growth.
Other employee compensation expense, which includes salaries 
and employee benefits, decreased $138 million or 4.5% from 2009, in 

part due to last year’s severance charges and the weaker U.S. dollar. 

Adjusting for these items, other compensation expense increased. There 

were 
business acquisitions and higher initiative spending. 
We continued 
to invest in our businesses and 
employment levels increased over the 
course of 2010.
Premises and equipment costs increased $62 million or 4.8%, pri-
marily related to software development in support of our business growth.
Other expenses rose $158 million or 10%, mainly in respect of a 
large number of small increases for initiative-related expenses such as 

professional fees and travel costs, primarily related to activities in 

support of our business growth. 
On July 1, 2010, the harmonized sales tax was implemented in 
both Ontario and British 
Columbia. This has increased the sales tax paid 
in these two jurisdictions, contributing to higher expenses in a number 

of expense categories relative to a year ago.
Productivity
The productivity ratio (expense-to-revenue ratio) improved by 450 basis 

points to 62.2% in 2010. Excluding the notable items that affected results 

in 2009, BMO’s productivity ratio improved by 54 basis points.
P&C’s productivity ratio improved to 55.3% from 56.6%. P&C Canada 
is BMO’s largest operating segment, and its productivity ratio of 51.1% 

improved by 260 basis points from last year with revenue growth sub-

stantially outpacing expense growth. The productivity ratio in P&C U.S. 

deteriorated by 600 basis points as the continuing difficult market condi-

tions affected revenue growth and costs increased on a U.S. dollar basis, 

primarily due to the Rockford, Illinois-based bank transaction, including 

acquisition integration costs. Adjusting costs in both years for the impact 

of impaired loan costs, changes in the Visa litigation accrual and acquisi-

tion integration costs, productivity deteriorated by 280 basis points to 

65.7%. The productivity ratio for Private Client Group in 2010 improved 

markedly by 620 basis points to 71.8%, reflecting increased revenue and 

effective expense control. BMO Capital Markets productivity ratio 

improved 100 basis points, driven by good revenue growth. 
BMO’s cash productivity ratio
(1) was 61.9%, a 440 basis point improve
-ment from 66.3% in 2009. Excluding the notable items that affected 
results in 2009, BMO’s cash productivity ratio improved by 46 basis points.
Examples of initiatives to enhance productivity are outlined in the 
2010 Review of Operating Groups Performance, which starts on page 42. 

Operating leverage was 7.6% and cash operating leverage was 7.5%. 

Our medium-term goal, over time, is to achieve average annual cash 
operating leverage of at least 1.5%, increasing revenues by an average of 

at least 1.5 percentage points more than the rate of cash-based expense 
growth. We aim to achieve operating leverage by driving revenues 
through an increased customer focus and ongoing expense management, 
working to create greater efficiency and effectiveness in all support 
functions, groups and business proces
ses that support the front line.
The productivity
 ratio
 (or 
expense-to-revenue ratio
) is our key 
measure of productivity. It is calculated as non-interest expense

divided by total revenues (on a taxable equivalent basis in 

the operating groups), expressed as a percentage. The 
cash 
productivity ratio
 is calculated in the same manner, after 
removing the amortization of intangible assets from non-interest 

expenses. See page 91.
(1) Cash-based measures are non-GAAP measures. See page 91.
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 41MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AProvision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes reflected in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income is based upon transactions recorded in income, regardless 
of when such transactions are subject to taxation by tax authorities, with 

the exception of the repatriation of retained earnings from foreign sub-

sidiaries, as outlined in Note 24 on page 155 of the financial statements.
Management assesses BMO’s consolidated results and associated 
provisions for income taxes on a GAAP basis. We assess the performance 

of the operating groups and associated income taxes on a taxable 

equivalent basis and report accordingly.
The provision for income taxes was $687 million in 2010, compared 
with $217 million in 2009. The effective tax rate in 2010 was 19.2%, 

compared with 10.5% in 2009. The higher effective tax rate in 2010 was 

mainly attributable to proportionately lower income from lower-tax-rate 

jurisdictions. There were also proportionately lower levels of recoveries 

of prior years’ income taxes and tax-exempt income.
BMO hedges the foreign exchange risk arising from its investments 
in U.S. operations by funding the investments in U.S. dollars. Under this 

program, the gain or loss on hedging and the unrealized gain or loss 
on translation of investments in U.S. operations are charged or credited 

to shareholders’ equity. For income 
tax purposes, the gain or loss on 
the hedging activities results in an income tax charge or credit in the 

current period, which is charged or credited to shareholders’ equity, 

while the associated unrealized gain or loss on the investments in 

U.S. operations does not incur income taxes until the investments are 

liquidated. The income tax charge/benefit arising from a hedging gain/
loss is a function of the fluctuations in exchange rates from period 
to period. Hedging of the investments in U.S. operations has given rise 
to income tax expense in shareholders’ equity of $206 million for 
the year, compared with $382 million in 2009. Refer to the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity on page 112 of the 
financial statements for further details.
Table 8 on page 99 details the $1,089 million of total net 
government levies and income tax expense incurred by BMO in 2010. 

The increase from $581 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher 

income tax expense.
Transactions with Related Parties
In the ordinary course of business, we provide banking services to 

our directors and executives and their affiliated entities, joint ventures 

and equity-accounted investees on the same terms that we offer to 

our customers for those services. A select suite of customer loan and 

mortgage products is offered to our employees at rates normally 
made available to our preferred customers. We also offer employees 

a fee-based subsidy on annual credit card fees.
Stock options and deferred share units granted to directors, and 
preferred rate loan agreements for executives relating to transfers we 
initiate, are discussed in Note 27 on page 159 of the financial statements.

398,474 438,548 397,609BMO employs a methodology for segmented reporting purposes 
whereby expected credit losses are charged to the operating groups 
quarterly based on their share of expected credit losses. The difference 

between quarterly charges based on expected credit losses and required 
quarterly provisions based on actual losses is charged to Corporate 

Services. The operating group results are presented on an expected 
credit loss basis. 
The actual specific provision for credit losses for P&C was 
$1,177 million, comprised of $712 million in P&C Canada and $465 million 

in P&C U.S., compared with $1,296 million, $664 million and $632 million, 
respectively, for the 2009 fiscal year. The P&C Canada provision for 

credit losses of 
$712 million included credit losses of $203 million related 
to securitized assets, which are reflected as a reduction of non-interest 

revenue in Corporate Services under our securitization reporting method-

ology and are therefore not included in BMO’s $1,049 million of specific 

provisions. For Private Client Group, the actual specific provision for credit 

losses was $13 million, compared with $30 million in 2009, and for BMO 

Capital Markets, the actual specific provision for credit losses for 2010 

was $62 million, compared with $389 million in 2009.
In 2010, we changed the manner in which we report securitized 
assets in our segmented disclosure. Previously, certain securitized mort-

gage assets were not reported in P&C Canada’s balance sheet. We now 

report all securitized mortgage assets in P&C Canada with offsetting 

amounts in Corporate Services, and net interest income earned on all 

securitized mortgage assets is included in P&C Canada net interest 

income. Previously, net interest income earned on certain securitized 

mortgage assets was included in P&C Canada non-interest revenue. 
These changes do not have a meaningful impact on the earnings of 

P&C Canada. Results for prior periods have been restated to conform to 

the current presentation.
BMO analyzes consolidated revenues on a GAAP basis. However, 
like many banks, BMO analyzes the revenues of its operating groups and 

associated ratios computed using revenue on a taxable equivalent basis 
(teb). This basis includes an adjustment that increases GAAP revenues 
and the GAAP provision for income taxes by an amount that would 
raise revenues on certain tax-exempt securities to a level equivalent to 
amounts that would incur tax at the statutory rate. The offset to the 
group teb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenues and 

income tax provisions.
In 2010, we determined that certain BMO Capital Markets 
trans 
actions should be reported on a teb. Similar transactions have 
been reported in prior periods and am
ounts reported in respect of those 

transactions in prior periods have been restated to reflect the current 
basis of reporting, resulting in increases in net interest income, net inter-

est margin and income taxes in BMO Capital Markets, with offsetting 
amounts reflected in Corporate Services.
To position our commercial business for growth as the United States 
emerges from recession, we identified U.S. mid-market clients that 
would be better served by a commercial banking model and transferred 
their business to P&C U.S. from BMO Capital Markets in the second 

quarter of 2010. As a result, P&C U.S. assumed $5.4 billion in loans and 
$3.2 billion in deposits, with results for prior periods restated to reflect 
the transfer.

MD&ACanadian Business Environment and Outlook
The Canadian economy emerged from recession in the summer of 
2009. The recovery was supported by broad-based growth in consumer 

and government spending, residential construction, exports and, more 

recently, business investment. Residential mortgage balance growth 

was strong in the first half of 2010, as homebuyers entered the market 

ahead of the introduction of the Harmonized Sales Tax in Ontario and 

British Columbia. However, residential mortgage growth eased in the 

second half due to higher interest rates and tighter mortgage rules. 

Retail operating deposits grew rapidly in 2009 and the first half of 2010, 

reflecting unwillingness to lock up savings in low-interest, fixed-term 

accounts. Rising interest rates encouraged savers to move back to 

fixed-term deposits in the second half of 2010. In commercial banking, 

deposit growth was strong, reflecting an upturn in profits and cash 

flows. Commercial loan growth slowed sharply in 2009 and into 2010, 

initially reflecting the significant decline in business investment in 
2009 and then tighter lending standards, but has shown recent signs 

of improvement. 
Looking forward to 2011, we anticipate that the recovery will 
continue at a moderate rate. Financial product performance will likely 
reflect the moderate rate of growth. In personal banking, deposit growth 
is expected to be dampened by relatively slow growth in personal 
income and a redeployment of deposits into equities and longer-term 

mutual funds. Housing sales are expected to continue their slow decline 

from previous record highs. As a result, growth in residential mortgage 

balances is expected to slow in 2011. In commercial banking, demand 

for non-residential mortgages and business loans should experience an 

upturn as the recovery in business investment gathers steam in 2011. 

Business deposit growth is expected to slow in 2011, as businesses 

deploy funds currently held as liquid assets.
P&C Canada Financial Results
P&C Canada net income was $1,644 million, up $229 million or 16% from 

a year ago.
Revenue increased $543 million or 10% to $5,830 million, driven 
by volume growth in most products and improvements in net interest 

margin, as well as the impact of the inclusion of ten months of the 

results of the Diners Club business in the current year. Net interest mar-

gin was 2.95%, 13 basis points hi
gher than in the prior year. The increase 
was largely driven by actions taken in 2009 to mitigate the impact of 

rising long-term funding costs, improvement in the spreads on deposit 

products from the unusually low levels of a year ago and higher volumes 

in more-profitable products.
In our personal banking business, revenue increased $231 million 
or 9.0%. The increase was driven by volume growth in personal lending 

products, improved net interest margin and higher revenue from our 

mutual fund products.
In our commercial banking segment, revenue increased $140 million 
or 9.4%. The increase was attributable to volume growth in loans and 
deposits, higher loan and deposit fees and mark-to-market investment 

securities losses in the prior year.
Cards and payment services revenue increased $172 million or 14%. 
The increase was attributable to growth in account balances and the 
$114 million impact of the inclusion of the results of the Diners Club 
business in the current year, partially offset by lower card fees. 
Non-interest expense was $2,978 million, up $141 million or 4.9% 
due to higher initiatives costs, the $45 million impact of the inclusion 
of the results of the Diners Club bus
iness in the current year and higher 
employee-related costs. Our cash productivity ratio improved 260 basis 

points to 51.0%, as revenue growth outpaced expense growth.

*  Loan and deposit growth and operating leverage in fiscal 2008 have not been restated 

for the impact of the 2010 portfolio transfer from BMO Capital Markets to P&C U.S.
Strengths and Value Drivers
• A rich heritage of more than 125 years in the U.S. Midwest with 
the established Harris brand, a commitment to service excellence as 
demonstrated by our strong customer loyalty scores and a history 
of playing an active role in our customers’ local communities.
• A comprehensive and increasingly integrated distribution network, 
supported by a differentiated customer experience.
• A large-scale, relationship-based commercial banking business

• Ability to leverage the capabilities and scale of BMO Financial Group.
Challenges
• The economic outlook continues to be uncertain, with relatively slow 
improvement and modest expectations for increased loan demand 

in 2011. 
• Regulatory oversight has become increasingly complex with the 
advent of new regulations and compliance requirements.
• Market dynamics remain competitive, as banks compete aggressively 
on pricing for both loans and deposi
ts to maintain and increase 
market share.

• Revenue grew almost 2% to $1.4 billion, reflecting improved net

in a difficult economic environment.
• Core deposits, which includes chequing, savings and certain money 
market accounts, grew by more than 15%, excluding the Rockford 

transaction, reflecting the success of our sales efforts.
• Expenses were unchanged excluding the impact of the Rockford 
transaction and impaired loans, changes in the Visa litigation accrual 

and valuation adjustments on our serviced mortgage portfolio.
Optimize our integrated distribution network and build our base 

of core households through organic expansion.

9.7% and 16.2%, respectively, with new customers representing

BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
49MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AU.S. Business Environment and Outlook 
Chicago’s financial services marketplace remains one of the most 
fragmented in the United States, with approximately 230 deposit-taking 

institutions. Harris and the two other largest banks in the Chicago area 

have together held only 25% to 37% of the personal and commercial 

deposit market since 1997. The Chicago area remains a highly contested 

market because of the growth opportunities presented by this frag-

mentation. Competitors are attempting to capture market share through 
acquisitions, aggressive pricing and continuous investment in their 

brands. Since November 1, 2009, there have been 15 bank failures in 

the Chicago area. The 2010 competitive dynamic has shifted with 

further consolidation of the market due in large part to FDIC-assisted 

transactions. P&C U.S. has participated in this consolidation, acquiring 

certain assets and liabilities of a Rockford, Illinois-based bank in an 

FDIC-assisted transaction.
We expect the U.S. Midwest economy to show a modest improve-
ment in 2011, consistent with the broader U.S. economy, led by a 
business recovery. Consumer and business loan demand should improve 
slowly as credit availability increases. Low home prices will likely 

continue to dampen demand for home equity loans, but low interest 

rates and rising employment should increase demand for residential 

mortgages. Consumer spending began to recover in 2010 and is 

expected to increase at a measured pace in 2011. Business investment 

in machinery and equipment rebounded in 2010 and should continue 

to advance at a brisk pace in 2011. However, non-residential construction 

continued to slump in 2010, and will likely remain weak in 2011, given 

high vacancy rates for commercial and industrial properties.
In 2011, we plan to continue to grow organically by embedding 
customer acquisition into our sales culture, providing compelling product 

offerings, becoming a commercial banking leader in the U.S. Midwest 

and leveraging our brand. We will strive to improve our financial 

performance by continuing to focus on revenue growth and effectively 

managing costs. By bringing clarity to our customers in the form of 

simplicity, guidance and know-how, we will continue to enhance our 

reputation as a strong, stable and customer-focused bank.
P&C U.S. Financial Results
P&C U.S. net income decreased $111 million or 39% from the prior year 
to $175 million. On a U.S. dollar basis, net income was $168 million, 

down $75 million or 31% from the prior year. Amounts in the rest of 
this section are expressed in U.S. dollars.
On a basis that adjusts for the impact of impaired loans, changes 
in the Visa litigation accrual and acquisition integration costs, net income
was $237 million, down $50 million or 17% from results of a year ago on 
a comparably-adjusted basis. On this adjusted basis, the cash productivity
 ratio was 64.2%, compared with 70.8% on a reported basis.
Late in the second quarter of 2010, we acquired certain assets 
and liabilities of a Rockford, Illinois-based bank from the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The transaction increased revenue by 

$42 million and expenses by $59 million (including acquisition integra-
tion costs of $19 million) and decreased net income by $10 million. 

The acquisition provides an excellent strategic fit that accelerates our 
growth strategy, adding quality locations and a good customer base 
and expanding our branch network into new key markets in northern 
Illinois and southern Wisconsin, where we already have a strong and 
growing commercial banking presence. 
Revenue of $1,367 million was $25 million or 1.8% higher in 2010. 
Adjusting results in both years for the impact of the Rockford transaction 

and the impact of impaired loans, revenue decreased $27 million or 
2.0% as the effect of loan spread improvement was more than offset 

by a reduction in commercial loan balances, caused by lower client 
utilization, and deposit spread compression. 
Non-interest expense of $991 million increased $96 million or 
11%. Adjusting costs in both years for the impact of the operating and 

integration costs arising from the Rockford transaction, increases in 

impaired loan costs, changes in the Visa litigation accrual and a valuation 
adjustment on our serviced mortgage portfolio related to lower long-term
 interest rates, non-interest expense increased $3 million or less than 1%. 
To position our commercial business for growth as the United States 
emerges from recession, we identified U.S. mid-market clients that 
would be better served by a commercial banking model and transferred 
their business to P&C U.S. from BMO Capital Markets in the second 

quarter of 2010. As a result, P&C U.S. assumed $5.4 billion in loans and 
$3.2 billion in deposits, with results for prior periods restated to reflect 

the transfer.

MD&APrivate Client Group Business Environment and Outlook
The U.S. economy is also expected to grow at a slow pace. Given this 
backdrop, it is likely that monetary authorities in both Canada and the 

United States will keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future.

This low rate environment will continue to pressure net interest income. 

Our asset levels should improve as capital markets in both countries 

are expected to continue to strengthen along with the economy and 

business confidence. 
We see the North American wealth management industry continuing 
to grow over the longer term, supported by changing demographics 
particularly in the retirement and high net worth sectors.
There was modest growth in the Canadian and U.S. economies in 

2010. Stronger equity markets contributed to growth in our asset levels 

and related fee-based revenues. Net interest income grew moderately, 
constrained by historically low interest rates but benefiting from 
increased cash holdings as some clients held liquid assets while waiting 

for markets to stabilize. The general decline in long-term interest rates 

had a negative impact on our insurance results as low rates resulted 

in an increase in policyholder liabilities.
The Canadian economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011, 
supported by relatively low interest rates and firmer commodity prices.

or 31% in 2010 from the previous year. PCG net income, excluding the 
insurance business, was $306 million, up $118 million or 62%. Results 

a year ago included a charge of $17 million ($11 million after tax) related 
to the decision to assist some of our U.S. clients by purchasing auction-rate
securities from their accounts in the weak capital markets environment. 

Insurance net income was $164 million, down $7 million or 3.6% from 

the previous year. Insurance results a year ago included a $23 million 

recovery of prior periods’ income taxes.
Revenue of $2,245 million increased $233 million or 12%. The 
increase reflected revenue growth across all of our businesses. Revenue 
growth in PCG, excluding insurance, was driven by an 11% (13% in 
source currency) improvement in client assets under management and 

administration. Insurance revenue increased due to higher premiums 

and the inclusion of a full year’s results of BMO Life Assurance, acquired 
late in the second quarter of 2009. This was partially offset by the 
effects of unfavourable market movements on policyholder liabilities. 
Net interest income increased primarily due to volume growth in our 

brokerage and private banking businesses, partially offset by spread 

compression in our brokerage businesses. The weaker U.S. dollar reduced 

revenue by $33 million or 1.6%. 
Non-interest expense of $1,611 million increased $42 million or 
2.6%, primarily due to higher revenue-based costs, in line with improved 

performance. The inclusion of a full year’s results of BMO Life Assurance 
also contributed to expense growth. The weaker U.S. dollar reduced 

expenses by $25 million or 1.6%. Expense growth was significantly 
lower than revenue growth, reflecting our continuing focus on expense 

management. This resulted in cash operating leverage of 9.1%. The 

cash productivity ratio improved by 630 basis points. 
U.S. operations recorded net income of US$16 million in 2010, com-
pared with a net loss of US$4 million in 2009. Revenue increased 16% 
and expenses were relatively unchanged, reflecting effective expense 
management initiatives. Results a year ago included a US$9 million 

after-tax charge related to the decision to assist our U.S. clients.

55MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&ABMO Capital Markets Business Environment and Outlook
BMO Capital Markets Financial Results
Fiscal 2010 saw strong results in BMO Capital Markets. The North American 
economy was off to a strong recovery at the start of the year, but slowed 
to a much more moderate pace in the latter half of the year. Conditions 

were favourable for our investment banking business in 2010 as mergers 

and acquisitions and debt underwriting fees improved, although equity 

underwriting revenue decreased from high levels in the prior year when 

corporate clients were seeking to strengthen their capital positions. 

The U.S. economy remains weak, which has suppressed corporate loan 

demand, resulting in lower corporate banking revenues. Similarly, 

corporate banking revenues were also down in Canada, but the effect 

was more muted due to a relatively stronger recovery. The aggressive 

interest rate easing in the United St
ates in the prior year had significantly 
benefited our interest-rate-sensitive businesses. Revenues from these 
businesses returned to historic levels in 2010 as rates stabilized during 

the year. Our favourable overall performance in 2010 reflected the 
strength, diversification and resilience of our core businesses.
BMO Capital Markets net income decreased $53 million to $820 million, 
as increases in revenues were offset by higher provisions for credit losses 
and increases in expenses. Prior year results were affected by charges of 

$521 million ($355 million after tax) related to the difficult capital markets
 environment. There were no such charges in 2010. Revenue increased 

$190 million to $3,279 million. The weaker U.S. dollar reduced revenue by 
$140 million. Revenue growth reflected the work we have undertaken 
in focusing on our core client base. 
Net interest income decreased $134 million or 8.8%, reflecting lower 
revenues from our interest-rate-sensitive businesses, which benefited 

from favourable market spreads in the prior year, and a decrease in 

corporate banking revenues primarily due to lower asset levels. Net 

interest margin increased 2 basis points due to higher trading net interest 

income, partially offset by lower spreads in our interest-rate-sensitive 

businesses and a decrease in corporate lending assets. 
Non-interest revenue increased $324 million or 21% due to invest-
ment securities gains in 2010 compared to significant losses 
in the prior 
year. Mergers and acquisitions and debt underwriting fees improved 

considerably, while equity underwriting fees decreased from elevated 

levels in the prior year. Trading revenues also decreased in a less favour-

able trading environment with fewer market opportunities. 
The provision for credit losses was $264 million compared with 
$146 million in 2009, as expected losses for 2010 were anticipated to be 

higher a year ago. 
Non-interest expense increased $78 million to $1,822 million due 
to increased employee costs, as we made strategic hires across our 

operations to position our business for future growth, and higher other 

costs, including a litigation settlement. The weaker U.S. dollar decreased 

expenses by $73 million. The group’s productivity ratio improved from 

56.5% to 55.5%, driven by the growth in revenue. Income taxes increased 

from 2009 primarily due to the higher proportion of income in lower-

tax-rate jurisdictions in the prior year. 
Net income from U.S. operations decreased US$238 million to 
US$67 million, reflecting significantly lower trading revenue and decreased 

revenues from our interest-rate-sensitive businesses, partially offset by 

increases in investment securities gains and investment banking revenue. 

Non-interest expense increased as we continued to invest in strategic 

hiring.
To position our commercial business for growth as the United States 
emerges from recession, we identified U.S. mid-market clients that would 

be better served by a commercial banking model and transferred these 

accounts to P&C U.S. from BMO Capital Markets in the second quarter of 
2010. As a result, P&C U.S. assumed US$5.4 billion in loans and US$3.2 billion
 in deposits, with results for prior periods restated to reflect the transfer. 
Transferring accounts that are primarily lending-based to P&C U.S. allows 
Looking forward, we expect the economic recovery to continue in 
Canada and the United States, although GDP has slowed and will likely 

grow only moderately in the first half of fiscal 2011 as the effects of 

previous stimulus measures abate. With unemployment still high and 

inflation pressures low, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain 
its policy of very low interest rates in the United States through 2011. 

The Bank of Canada, after a period of rate tightening this year, is 
now holding steady and is not expected to resume raising rates until 

the spring of 2011. Capital market conditions should continue to improve, 

which will benefit our fee-based businesses. Our focus in 2011 will 

be to continue to deliver a strong return on equity with stable, high-

quality earnings. Growth in fiscal 2011 will depend on the performance 

of financial and commodity markets, as well as general economic 

activity and business confidence.
BMO Capital Markets to direct its attention to sectors and clients where 
it has a differentiated competitive advantage while maintaining a clear 
focus on winning investment banking mandates.

MD&ACorporate Services, including Technology and Operations
Corporate Services consists of the corporate units that provide enterprise-
wide expertise and governance support in a variety of areas, including 
strategic planning, risk management, finance, legal and compliance, 

communications and human resources. Our operating results reflect the 

impact of certain securitization and asset-liability management activities, 

the elimination of taxable equivale
nt adjustments and the impact of 
our expected loss provisioning methodology.
Technology and Operations (T&O) manages, maintains and provides 
governance over information technology, operations services, real 

estate and sourcing for BMO Financial Group. T&O focuses on enterprise-

wide priorities that improve service quality and efficiency to deliver 

an excellent customer experience.
Financial Results
Operating results for T&O are included with Corporate Services for 

reporting purposes. However, the costs of T&O services are transferred 

to the three operating groups, and only minor amounts are retained in 

T&O results. As such, results in this section largely reflect the corporate 

activities outlined above.
Corporate Services net loss for the year was $299 million, compared 
with a net loss of $1,146 million in 2009. The improvement was attrib-

utable to lower provisions for credit losses and higher revenues. The 

provision for credit losses was $821 million lower as a result of reduced 

provisions charged to Corporate Services under our expected loss pro-

visioning methodology. Included in the 2009 provision for credit losses 

was a $60 million increase in the general allowance for credit losses. 
There was no change in the general allowance in 2010. The improvement 
in revenues is primarily related to a decrease in the negative carry on 

certain asset-liability interest rate positions as a result of management 

actions and more stable market conditions, as well as the diminished 

impact in 
2010 of funding activities in prior years that enhanced our 
strong 
liquidity position.
As explained on page 43, BMO analyzes revenues on a teb basis 
at the operating group level, with an offsetting adjustment in Corporate 
Services. Results reflect teb reductions in net interest income and 

related income taxes. The impact on net interest income is itemized 
in the adjacent table.

based on each group’s share of expected credit losses. Corporate Services 

is generally charged (or credited) with differences between expected 

loss provisions charged to the client operating groups and provisions 

required under GAAP.

Total assets increased $23.2 billion or 6.0% from the prior year to 
$411.6 billion at October 31, 2010, despite the impact of the weaker 

U.S. dollar on U.S.-dollar-denominated assets, which reduced the increase 

by approximately $5.3 billion. The year-end exchange rate is used for 

translation of assets and liabilities and the U.S. dollar was weaker at 

October 31, 2010, than at October 31, 2009. The $23.2 billion increase 
reported in assets primarily reflects increases in securities of $12.6 billion, 

net loans and acceptances of $8.8 billion and cash and interest bearing 

deposits with banks of $7.3 billion, as well as a $1.9 billion increase in 

derivative instruments, which are included in other assets in the adjacent 

table. Securities borrowed or purc
hased under resale agreements fell 
by $7.9 billion. 
Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity increased $23.2
 billion or 
6.0%. There was a $13.1
 billion increase in deposits, a $9.2
 billion increase
 in other liabilities and a $1.7
 billion increase in shareholders’ equity.
Cash and Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks
Cash and interest bearing deposits with banks increased $7.3 billion to 
$20.6
 billion in 2010, reflecting the growth in cash invested on a short-
term basis with the U.S. Federal Reserve, a response to deposit growth 
and lower loan balances in certain businesses in the United States.

the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, which lowered the increase by 

$4.0 billion. Consumer instalment and other personal loans increased 

$5.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in demand for personal lending 

products, particularly in the Canadian market. Residential mortgages 

increased $3.2 billion, reflecting strong growth in Canada in the first half 

of 2010, as homebuyers chose to fi
nance their purchases before the 

introduction of the Harmonized Sales Tax in Ontario and British Columbia, 

as well as lower levels of securitization activity. These factors were 

partially offset by lower mortgage balances in the United States, reflect-

ing secondary market sales. Credit card loans increased $0.7 billion due 

to the Diners Club business acquisition and lower levels of securitization 

activity. Overall loan growth was increased by US$1.3 billion by the 

Rockford, Illinois-based bank transaction and $1.0 billion by the Diners 

Club business acquisition. 
Table 11 on page 102 provides a comparative summary of loans by 
geographic location and product. Table 13 on page 103 provides a com-

parative summary of net loans in Canada by province and industry. Loan 

quality is discussed on page 40 and further details on loans are provided 

in Notes 4, 5 and 8 to the financial statements, starting on page 120.
Other Assets
Other assets increased $2.4 billion to $62.9 billion, primarily reflecting 

an increase of $1.9 billion in derivative financial instrument assets. 

The year-over-year increase was primarily due to movements in interest 

rates and their impact on the valuation of contracts. Volatility in interest 

rates increases the value of derivative assets and liabilities, usually 

comparably. Derivative instruments are detailed in Note 10 on 

page 130 of the financial statements.

reduced deposit growth by $5.6 billion. Deposits from businesses 

and governments, which account for 52% of total deposits, increased 

$17.0 billion, largely as a result of the replacement of maturing deposits 

by banks and funding our growth in loans and securities. Deposits from 

individuals, which account for 40% of total deposits, decreased $0.4 bil-

lion but increased $1.2 billion in source currency. Deposits by banks, which 

account for 8% of total deposits, decreased $3.5 billion due to maturing

• meets our target regulatory capital ratios and internal assessment 
of required economic capital;
• is consistent with our targeted credit ratings;
• underpins our operating groups’ business strategies; and
• builds depositor confidence and long-term shareholder value. 
Capital Management Framework
The principles and key elements of BMO’s capital management frame-

work are outlined in our capital management corporate policy and 

in our annual capital plan, which in
cludes the results of the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). 
ICAAP is an integrated process that evaluates capital adequacy, and 
is used to establish capital targets and capital strategies that take into 
consideration the strategic direction and risk appetite of the organization. 
The ICAAP and capital plan are developed in conjunction with BMO’s 

annual business plan, promoting al
ignment between our business and 
risk strategies, regulatory and economic capital requirements, and 

capital availability. Capital adequacy is assessed by comparing capital 

supply (the amount of capital availa
ble to support losses) to capital 
demand (the capital required to support the risks underly
ing our business
 activities as measured by economic capital). Enterprise-wide stress 

testing and scenario analysis are also used to assess the impact of 

various stress conditions on BMO’s risk profile and capital requirements. 

The framework seeks to ensure that we are adequately capitalized, 

given the risks we take, and supports the determination of limits, goals 

and performance measures that are used to manage balance sheet 

positions, risk levels and capital requirements at both the consolidated 

entity and line of business level. Assessments of actual and forecast 

capital adequacy are compared to the capital plan throughout the year, 

and the capital plan is updated as required, based on changes in our 

business activities, risk profile or operating environment.
BMO uses both regulatory and economic capital to evaluate business
 performance and as the basis for strategic, tactical and transactional 

decision-making. By allocating capital to operating units and measuring 

their performance in relation to the capital necessary to support the 

risks in their business, we seek to maximize our risk-adjusted return to 
shareholders, while maintaining a well-capitalized position. This approach
 aims to protect our stakeholders from the risks inherent in our various 

businesses, while still allowing the flexibility to deploy resources to the 

high-return, strategic growth activities of our operating groups. Capital in 

excess of what is necessary to supp
ort our line of business activities is 
held in Corporate Services.
Governance
The Board of Directors and its Risk Review Committee provide ultimate 

oversight and approval of capital management, including our capital 

management corporate policy, capital plan and ICAAP results. They regu-

larly review BMO’s capital position, capital adequacy assessments and 
key capital management activities. The Risk Manage 
ment Committee and 
Capital Management Committee provide senior management oversight, 

and also review and discuss significant capital policies, issues and action
 items that arise in the execution of our enterprise-wide strategy. Finance 

and Risk Management are responsible for the design and implementa-
tion of the corporate policies and framework related to capital and risk 
management and the ICAAP. Our ICAAP operating processes are reviewed 

on an annual basis by our Corporate Audit division.
2010 Regulatory Capital Review
Regulatory capital requirements for the consolidated entity are currently

determined on a Basel II basis. BMO 
uses the Advanced Internal Ratings 
Based (AIRB) Approach to determine credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) 

in our portfolio and the Standardized Approach to determine operational 

RWA. In 2010, BMO’s U.S. retail banking subsidiary Harris Bancorp, Inc. 

used the Standardized Approach to determine credit RWA. BMO’s market 

RWA are primarily determined using 
the Internal Models Approach, but 
the Standardized Approach is used for some exposures.
The AIRB Approach is the most advanced of the approaches for 
determining credit risk capital requirements under Basel II. It utilizes 
sophisticated techniques to measure RWA at the borrower level, based on
 sound risk management principles, including consideration of estimates 

of the probability of default, the likely loss given default, exposure 

at default, term to maturity and the type of Basel Asset Class exposure. 

These risk parameters are determined using historical portfolio data 

supplemented by benchmarking, and are updated periodically. Validation 

procedures related to these parameters are in place and are enhanced 

periodically in order to appropriately qua
ntify and differentiate risks so 
they reflect changes in economic and credit conditions.
Under the Standardized Approach, operational risk capital require-
ments are determined by the size and type of our lines of business. 
Gross income, as defined under Basel II, serves as a proxy for the size of 
the line of business and as an indicator of operational risk. Gross income 
is segmented into eight regulatory business lines by business type, and 
each segment amount is multiplied by a corresponding factor prescribed 

by the Basel II framework to determine its operational risk capital 

requirement. For further details on B
asel II, refer to the Enterprise-Wide 
Risk Management section starting on page 75.

BMO’s total RWA were $161.2 billion at October 31, 2010, down 
from $167.2 billion in 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to 
the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, which reduced the translated value 

of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA, and lower corporate and commercial 

RWA. These factors were partially offset by an increase in retail loan, 

securitization and operational risk RWA. The table below provides a 

breakdown of our RWA by risk type.

assets and certain other deductions required under Basel II. Our Tier 1 

capital was $21.7 billion at October 31, 2010, up from $20.5 billion in 2009. 
The increase was primarily attributable to growth in common shareholders’ 
equity, partially offset by the impact of a redemption of innovative 
hybrid capital, as outlined under Capital Management Activities.
Total capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, net of certain deduc-
tions. Tier 2 capital is primarily comprised of subordinated debentures and
 the eligible portion of the general allowance for credit losses. Deductions 
from Tier 2 capital are primarily comprised of our investments in insurance
 subsidiaries and other substantial investments, along with other sundry 

Basel II deductions. Total capital was $25.6 billion at October 31, 2010, 

up from $24.9 billion in 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to 

growth in common shareholders’ eq
uity, partially offset by the impact 
of capital redemptions, as outlined under Capital Management Activities.
Our objective is to maintain strong capital ratios that meet both 
current and expected regulatory requirements. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

and Tangible Common Equity Ratio are our key measures of capital 

adequacy, and both were strong in 2010.

in 2009. The Tangible Common Equity Ratio increased from 9.21% in 2009 

to 10.47% at October 31, 2010. The year-over-year increase in the ratios 

reflects a reduction in RWA and an increase in capital. The ratios were 

maintained at strong levels during 2010 in anticipation of pending 

regulatory capital changes and the adoption of International Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS) and in order to maintain financial strength 

and flexibility as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Further 

details on the potential impact of proposed regulatory capital changes 

and IFRS are provided in the next section. 
The Common Equity Ratio, a new measure that is increasingly 
being monitored by banks, will become a regulatory capital ratio under 

Basel III (see next section for further in
formation on the definition of the 
ratio and Basel III requirements). The bank’s Common Equity Ratio was 

10.26% on a Basel II basis at October 31, 2010, up from 8.95% in 2009. 
The Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Tangible Common Equity Ratio, 

Total Capital Ratio and Assets-to-Capital Multiple are our 

primary capital measures.
The Tier 1 Capital Ratio
 is defined as Tier 1 capital divided 
by RWA.
The Tangible Common Equity Ratio
 is defined as common 
shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangibles, divided 
by RWA.
The Total Capital Ratio
 is defined as total capital divided 
by RWA.
The Assets-to-Capital Multiple
 is calculated by dividing total 
assets, including specified off-balance sheet items net of other 

specified deductions, by total capital.
60 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AOur Total Capital Ratio was 15.91% at October 31, 2010, up from
 14.87% in 2009. Both our Tier 1 and Total Capital Ratios remain well 
above the current minimum capital ratios stipulated by the Office of the 

Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) of 7% and 10%, 

respectively, for a well-capitalized financial institution. BMO’s Assets-to-
Capital Multiple was 14.5 at October 31, 2010, up from 14.1 in 2009. The 
multiple remains well below the current maximum permitted by OSFI. 
As noted in the Provisions for Income Taxes section, we hedge 
the foreign exchange risk arising from our net investment in our 

U.S. operations by funding the net investment in U.S. dollars. This 

strategy reduces the impact on our capital ratios of changes in foreign 

exchange rates, as the effect of foreign currency adjustments to Tier 1 

capital arising from changes in the value of the Canadian dollar is 

partially offset by the change in t
he Canadian-dollar equivalent of 
U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA. 
BMO conducts business through a variety of corporate structures, 
including subsidiaries and joint ventures. All of our subsidiaries must 

meet the regulatory and legislative requirements of the jurisdictions in 

which they operate. A framework is in place to ensure that subsidiaries 

and their parent entities have access to capital and funding to support 

their ongoing operations under both normal and stressed conditions.
Potential Impacts of Proposed Regulatory Capital 
Changes and Conversion to IFRS
Over the past two years, global regulators have proposed reforms that 
are 
intended to strengthen the banking sector regulatory capital and 
liquidity
 frameworks and strengthen the resilience of individual banking 
institutions in periods of stress. Collectively, these new global standards 

are referred to as “Basel III”. Based on regulatory guidance provided 
to date, the key building blocks of Basel III from a regulatory capital 
perspective include:
• raising the quality of capital that banks are required to hold to ensure 
banks are better able to absorb losses on both a going-concern and 

liquidation basis;
• increasing risk capital requirements, particularly for market risk, 
securitizations and counterparty credit risk;
• introducing new regulatory capital ratios 
Œ the Common Equity Ratio 
and the Leverage Ratio 
Œ to complement the existing Tier 1 Capital 
Ratio and Total Capital Ratio; and
• increasing minimum capital requirements.
The Basel III rules are expected to be implemented in a phased approach. 
The final requirements and transition period applicable to BMO will be 

established by OSFI. Market risk and securitization exposure RWA 

changes are expected to be implemented in fiscal 2012. Counterparty 

credit risk and other RWA changes are scheduled to be implemented on 
January 1, 2013, and new capital deductions are scheduled to be phased in 

at 20% per year beginning on January 1, 2014 and ending January 1, 2018. 
New minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements are scheduled to 

be implemented over a transition period that runs from January 1, 2013 
to January 1, 2019, or earlier, depending on local regulatory requirements. 
The minimum capital ratio requirements will include a capital con 
ser-
vation buffer that can absorb losses during periods of stress. If a bank 
operates within the buffer, restrictions on earnings distributions (e.g. 

dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary compensation) would 

likely ensue, with the degree of such restrictions varying with the 

position within the buffer range. Moreover, subject to the discretion of 
the bank supervisory or regulatory authorities, a countercyclical capital 
buffer requirement ranging from 0% to 2.5% of RWA could also be 

imposed on banking organizations when it is deemed that excess 

aggregate credit growth has resulted in a build-up of systemic risk. 

This countercyclical capital buffer, when in effect, would serve as an 

additional buffer that supplements the capital conservation buffer. 
Under Basel III, two new regulatory capital metrics are expected 

to be introduced: 
The Common Equity Ratio 
is defined as common equity 
less required capital deductions, divided by risk-weighted assets. 

This ratio is also referred to as the Tier 1 Common Ratio.
The Leverage Ratio 
is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by on-
balance sheet assets and specified off-balance sheet items net of 

specified deductions.
Non-common share Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments must meet 
new requirements to qualify as regulatory capital under Basel III. Existing 
instruments that do not meet these new requirements are expected 

to be subject to grandfathering provisions and phased out over a 10-year 

period beginning January 1, 2013. Us
ing a base equal to the amount 
of such instruments outstanding on January 1, 2013, their recognition 

is expected to be capped at 90% from January 1, 2013, with the cap 

reducing by 10 percentage points in each subsequent year. In addition, 

instruments with an incentive to be redeemed are expected to be 

phased out at their effective maturity date. Under the proposed rules, 

a large majority of the bank’s existing innovative Tier 1 capital (BMO 

Capital Trust Securities and BMO Tier 1 Notes) and Tier 2 subordinated 

debt instruments are not expected to qualify as regulatory capital 

once the rules are fully implemented. We expect the regulatory capital 

treatment of the bank’s other non-common share capital instruments 

and related grandfathering treatment to be determined after the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) finalizes its position on 
contingent capital in fiscal 2011.
The proposed final minimum capital ratio requirements under 
Basel III are higher than current Canadian requirements as established 

by OSFI under Basel II and are summarized in the following table.

 61MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Aplanned for 2011. In addition, the BCBS is working with the Financial 
Stability Board to address the risk of systemically important banks and 

has recommended that for such banks, additional capital requirements 

be adopted, such as capital surcharges and contingent capital. These 

changes could affect the amount of capital that we hold to meet regula-

tory requirements. 
BMO’s strong capital levels position us well to adopt both the 
announced regulatory changes and IFRS accounting changes in the com-

ing years. We do not expect the announced changes in regulatory capital 

requirements to materially affect our strategic or tactical direction.
Economic Capital Review
Economic capital is our internal asse
ssment of the risks underlying BMO’s 
business activities. It represents management’s estimation of the likely 

magnitude of economic losses that could occur should adverse situations 

arise, and allows returns to be measured on a basis that considers the 
risks taken. Economic capital is calculated for various types of risk 
Œ credit,
 market (trading and non-trading), operational and business 
Œ where 
measures are based on a time horizon of one year. For further discussion 

of these risks, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section 

on page 75. Economic capital is a key element of our risk-based capital 

management and ICAAP framework.
Capital Management Activities
There were no share issuances in 2010, other than through the 

bank’s Shareholder Dividend Reinvest
ment and Share Purchase Plan 
and the exercise of stock options. We redeemed $500 million 4.00% 

Series C Medium-Term Notes, Tranche 1 on January 21, 2010 and 

$350 million BMO Capital Trust Securities 
Œ Series A (BMO BOaTS 
Œ Series A) on June 30, 2010. On November 23, 2010, we announced our 
intention to redeem the $400 million BMO Capital Trust Securities 
Œ Series B (BMO BOaTS 
Œ Series B) on December 31, 2010. Further 

details are provided in Notes 18 and 20 on pages 142 and 145 of 

the financial statements.
On October 27, 2010, we announced our intention to renew our 
normal course issuer bid, subject to the approval of OSFI and the Toronto 

Stock Exchange, under which we may repurchase for cancellation up 
to 15 million BMO common shares (representing approximately 2.7% 
of the public float). No common 
shares were repu
rchased under our 
previous normal course issuer bid, which expired on December 1, 2010.
Dividends
BMO’s target dividend payout range over the medium term is 45% to 

55% of net income available to common shareholders. The target is 

indicative of our confidence in our continued ability to increase earnings 
and our strong capital position. BMO’s target dividend payout range 

seeks to provide shareholders with stable income, while ensuring 
We believe the Common Equity Ratio and the Tier 1 Capital Ratio 
are the most important capital ratios under Basel III. After full imple-

mentation of announced Basel III capital deductions and RWA changes 

and including the potential impact of certain key changes associated 

with the adoption of IFRS, based on our analysis to date, as set out 

in Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards in the Future 

Changes in Accounting Policies 
Œ IFRS section on page 71, BMO’s pro-
forma October 31, 2010 Common Equity Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio 

would be 7.8% and 10.4%, respectively, exceeding the announced 
Basel III 2019 minimum capital requirements. The pro-forma ratios are 
derived using our October 31, 2010 balance sheet and are based on 

our understanding of the proposed regulatory rules, which are not 

yet finalized and are subject to further change. The pro-forma ratios 

do not reflect management actions that may be taken to mitigate 

the impact of the changes, the bene
fit of additional retained earnings 

growth over time that could be available to meet these requirements, 

or factors beyond the control of management. We believe BMO is 

also well-positioned to meet the other capital requirements. 
Under the above view, the bank’s regulatory common equity 
would decrease by $1.5 billion from $16.5 billion to $15.0 billion as of 

October 31, 2010 and its Tier 1 capital would decrease by $1.7 billion from 

$21.7 billion to $20.0 billion. Regulatory common equity and Tier 1 capital 

decrease relative to reported October 31, 2010 Basel II results, primarily 

because of the impact of the adoption of IFRS on retained earnings, as 

well as a new capital deduction for intangible assets. These factors are 

partially offset by the removal of certain existing deductions from capital 

and their conversion to higher levels of RWA. We have assumed existing 

non-common share Tier 1 capital instruments are fully included in Tier 1 

capital for purposes of this calculation. Certain of these instruments do 
not meet Basel III capital requirements and are expected to be subject 

to the grand 
fathering provisions previously noted. We expect to be 
able to refinance non-common capital instruments as and when necessary
 to meet applicable non-common capital requirements.
Our RWA as at October 31, 2010 would increase by $31.3 billion 
from $161.2 billion to $192.5 billion, primarily due to higher counterparty 

credit risk RWA ($23.4 billion) and, to a lesser extent, higher market 
risk RWA and the conversion of certain existing Basel II capital deductions
 to RWA ($7.9 billion), as noted above. The quantification of the change in 

counterparty credit risk RWA is based on Basel III proposals developed 

earlier this year. There continues to be significant ongoing discussion 

concerning the approach to quantifying counterparty credit risk and, 

as a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the final impact 

on RWA. The expected introduction of central clearing agencies for 

certain derivative transactions, together with management actions, are 

expected to significantly mitigate the increase in counterparty credit 

risk RWA noted above.
As previously noted, the regulatory treatment of capital deductions 
is scheduled to change between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2018. 

Based on the same underlying as
sumptions as above but using the 
January 1, 2013 transitional arrangements for capital deductions, the 
bank’s pro-forma October 31, 2010 Common Equity Ratio and Tier 1 Capital
 Ratio would be 9.0% and 10.8%, respectively, higher than the 2019 

requirements. The Common Equity Ratio is higher under the 2013 transi-

tional view than under the 2018 view because the $1.5 billion goodwill 
deduction is initially taken from non-common share Tier 1 capital in 2013. 
Between 2013 and 2018, the goodwill deduction is scheduled to change 

to a deduction from common equity, lowering the Common Equity Ratio. 

The treatment of intangible assets and new Basel III deductions have a 

similar impact on the 2013 to 2018 Common Equity and Tier 1 Ratios.
A number of other potential regulatory changes are still being 
finalized. For example, counterparty credit risk requirements and 

countercyclical capital buffer requirements have not yet been finalized 

and a fundamental review of trading book capital requirements is

Dividends declared per common share in 2010 totalled $2.80. 
Annual dividends declared in 2010 represented 58.8% of net income

our earnings, which we expect will result in a dividend payout ratio 

within our target range. Over the long term, BMO’s dividends are 

generally increased in line with trends in earnings per share growth. 
At year end, BMO’s common shares provided a 4.6% annual dividend
 yield based on the year-end closing share price. On December 7, 2010, 
BMO announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend

Under the Shareholder Dividend Reinve
stment and Share Purchase

At the request of the G7 finance mi
nisters and central bank governors, 
The Financial Stability Forum (since re-established as the Financial 

Stability Board) issued a report in April 2008 on enhancing market 

and institutional resilience. Among its recommendations, the report 

encouraged enhanced disclosure related to financial instruments that 

markets had come to regard as carrying higher risk. We expanded 

our discussion of certain financial instruments in 2008 in keeping with 
these developments and we have continued to report on them, together
 with other financial instruments, to put exposures in context relative to 
our portfolio. We have also followed a practice of reporting on significant
 changes in our interim MD&A.

Consumer Loans
In Canada, our consumer loan portfolio totalled $85.7 billion at 

October 31, 2010 and is comprised of three main asset classes: residen-

tial mortgages (48%), instalment and other personal loans (48%) and 

credit card loans (4%).
In the United States, our consumer loan portfolio totalled 
US$15.0 billion and is also primarily comprised of three asset classes: 

residential first mortgages (34%), home equity products (33%) and 

indirect automobile loans (29%).
The following is a discussion of subprime mortgage loans, Alt-A 
mortgage loans and home equity prod
ucts, portfolios that have been
of increased investor interest in the economic environment of the past 

few years. It also includes a discussion on repurchased mortgages.
Subprime Mortgage Loans

In the United States, subprime loans are typically considered to be 

those made to borrowers with credit bureau scores of 620 or less. 

We do not originate subprime mortgages through a subprime mortgage 

program in the United States; however, we make loans available in 

the United States to individuals with credit scores below 620 as part 

of our compliance with le
nding requirements under the 
Community 
Reinvestment Act
. We also occasionally lend to parties with credit 

scores below 620 when there are other strong qualification criteria. 

As a result, we have US$0.27 billion of first mortgage loans outstanding 
with subprime characteristics at the date of authorization. A small 

portion of these are uninsured loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 
greater than 80% at issuance. At year end, US$15.8 million or 5.94% 

(US$18.5 million or 6.29% in 2009) of the US$0.27 billion of loans were 
90 days or more in arrears. This compares with a rate of 4.46% for 
BMO’s total U.S. first mortgage loan portfolio. 
We also had net exposure of US$69 million (US$101 million in 
2009) to a business that buys distressed mortgages (including subprime
 mortgages) at a discounted price.
Home equity products are secured by the homeowner’s equity 
and rank subordinate to any existing first mortgage on the property. In 

the United States, we have a US$5.0 billion home equity loan portfolio, 
which amounted to 2.9% of BMO’s total loan portfolio at October 31, 2010. 
Of the U.S. home equity portfolio, loans of US$0.28 billion were extended 
to customers with credit bureau scores below 620 and would be 

categorized as subprime loans. Of these, only US$7 million or 2.56% 
(US$7 million or 2.1% in 2009) were 90 days or more in arrears.
In Canada, BMO does not have any subprime mortgage programs, 
nor do we purchase subprime mortgage loans from third-party lenders. 

BMO mortgage lending decisions incorporate a full assessment of the 

customer and loan structure. Credit score is only one component of our 

credit adjudication process and consequently, we do not categorize 
Select Financial Instruments
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 63MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Aloans based upon credit scores alone. A nominal amount of mortgage 
loans with subprime characteristics are held in certain BMO-sponsored 

Canadian conduits that hold third-party assets, as described in the 

discussion of those conduits that follows.
In Canada, we have a $21.2 billion home equity line of credit 
portfolio ($36.1 billion authorized). The portfolio is of high quality, with 

only 0.11% (0.11% in 2009) of loans in the portfolio 90 days or more 

in arrears. Of these lines of credit, one product line is offered only in first 

mortgage position and represents 
approximately 71% of the total port-
folio. We also have a $0.25 billion home equity instalment loan portfolio, 

in which $2 million of loans were 90 days or more in arrears.
Alt-A First Mortgage Loans
In the United States, Alt-A loans are generally considered to be loans 

for which borrower qualifications are subject to limited verification. 

The U.S. loan portfolio had two loan programs that met this definition 
Œ 
our Easy Doc and No Doc programs. We discontinued offering the Easy 
Doc and No Doc programs in the third quarter of 2008. Loans under the No 
Doc program, which comprise most of the exposure in this class, required 
minimum credit bureau scores of 660 and maximum loan-to-value ratios 

of 80% (90% with private mortgage insurance). Due to these lending 

requirements, the credit quality of our Alt-A portfolio is strong and the 

loans have performed relatively well. In the United States, our direct 

Alt-A loans totalled US$0.9 billion at year end (US$1.2 billion in 2009). 

Of these, US$61 million or 6.42% (US$65 million or 5.23% in 2009) were 

90 days or more in arrears. This compares with a rate of 4.46% (2.77% 

in 2009) for BMO’s total U.S. first mortgage loan portfolio.
BMO also offered two limited documentation programs within 
the home equity loan portfolio in the United States, which would 

be categorized as Alt-A if they were in the first mortgage loan portfolio. 

As of October 31, 2010, the amou
nt authorized under these programs 
was US$0.9 billion, of which US$0.6 billion was outstanding. Loans 

made under these programs have the same strong credit score and 

loan-to-value requirements as the first mortgage loan portfolio, and 
as such the portfolio has performed well. As at October 31, 2010, 
US$11 million or 1.78% (US$6 million or 0.95% in 2009) of the loans in 

this portfolio were 90 days or more in arrears. This compares with a rate 

of 1.29% (1.10% in 2009) for BMO’s total U.S. home equity loan portfolio. 
Subprime and Alt-A loans are ge
nerally considered to carry higher 
risk than traditional prime loans. We also consider loans to customers 

with credit scores between 620 and 660 and a loan-to-value ratio 

above 80% (without private mortgage insurance) to be a higher-risk 

component of our portfolio. At year end, this component represented 

a negligible amount within our total U.S. loan portfolio.
In Canada, we do not have a mortgage program that we consider 
to be Alt-A. In the past, we may have chosen to not verify income or 

employment for certain customers when there were other strong quali-

fications that supported the creditwort
hiness of the loan as part of our 
credit adjudication process; however, this approach is no longer in use. 

We also have a Newcomers to Canada/non-resident mortgage program 

that permits limited income verification but has other strong qualification 
criteria. At October 31, 2010, there was approximately $3.0 billion ($2.4 bil-
lion in 2009) outstanding under this program. Of this, only $15 million 

or 0.50% ($12 million or 0.50% in 2009) of the loans were 90 days or 
more in arrears, reflecting the high credit quality of these loans. A nominal 
amount of mortgage loans with Alt-A characteristics are held in certain 

BMO-sponsored Canadian conduits that hold third-party assets, as 

described in the discussion of those conduits that follows.
Mortgage Repurchases
From time to time, Harris sells fixed-rate mortgage loans originated 
within its branch network to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (Freddie Mac), a corporation chartered by the United States 

federal government. Generally, mortgage loan purchasers, including 

Freddie Mac, have the right to require a mortgage loan seller to 

repurchase a loan when it is subs
equently determined that the loan did 
not meet the terms and conditions of 
the purchase and sale agreement 
at the time of sale. The recent distress in the mortgage loan market has 

prompted purchasers, such as Freddie Mac, to increase their review of 

loans purchased to determine if seller
s are required to repurchase loans 
that did not meet the terms and conditions of the purchase and sale 
agreement at the time of sale. P&C U.S. has received a total of 41 requests
 to repurchase mortgage loans totalling US$7.2 million in fiscal 2010, 

of which approximately half were repurchased, one quarter were deter-

mined to have met the terms and conditions of the purchase and sale 

agreement and were not repurchased, and one quarter remain under 

discussion. At this time, we do not anticipate material losses from future 

mortgage loan repurchase obligations.
Euro Zone Exposures
In the euro zone, BMO’s direct credit exposures in Greece, Ireland, Italy, 

Portugal and Spain are primarily to banks for trade finance, lending and 

trading products. Exposures remain modest at $194 million. In addition, 

our Irish subsidiary is required to ma
intain reserves with the Irish central 
bank. These totalled $271 million at the end of the year. 
The BMO-managed structured investment vehicles (SIVs) had 
exposure with a par value of $243 million to banks in these countries as 
at October 31, 2010. Included in the exposure was $203 million par value 

of Irish bank and insurance company subordinated debt. Subsequent 

to year end, the SIVs recorded a $143 million impairment charge against 
this amount. This impairment charge reduces the book value of the SIVs’ 

subordinated capital notes, with no direct impact on BMO’s financial results. 
Subsequent to year end, the SIVs’ e
xposure to the noted countries was 
reduced by $40 million par value related to the sale of non-Irish debt. 

The impact of the impairment charge and the sale reduces the SIVs’ par 

value exposure to the banks in these countries to $60 million.
Leveraged Finance
Leveraged finance loans are defined by BMO as loans to private equity 
businesses and mezzanine financings where our assessment indicates 

a higher level of credit risk. BMO has exposure to leveraged finance 

loans, which represent less than 1% of our total assets, with $3.3 billion 

outstanding as at October 31, 2010, down approximately $300 million 

from a year ago. Of this amount, $219 million or 6.6% of loans were 

classified as impaired ($201 million or 5.6% in 2009).
Monoline Insurers and Credit Derivative Product Companies
At October 31, 2010, BMO’s direct exposure to companies that specialize 

in providing default protection amounted to $121 million in respect 

of the mark-to-market value of counterparty derivatives and $9 million 

in respect of the mark-to-market value of traded credits ($256 million 

and $19 million in 2009). The cumulative adjustment for counterparty 

credit risk recorded against these exposures was $40 million 

($20 million in 2009).
Approximately 41% of the $121 million gross exposure is related 
to counterparties rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The remainder is 

largely related to counterparties rated below investment grade. In 2009, 

60% of the $256 million exposure was related to counterparties rated A 

or better by S&P. Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s) credit ratings are 

lower. The notional value of direct contracts involving monoline insurers 

and credit derivative product companies was approximately $3.4 billion 

($3.8 billion in 2009). Most contracts with these companies relate to 

collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs) 

within our trading portfolio and provide protection against losses arising 

from defaults. These instruments have minimal subprime exposure. 

Certain credit derivative product counterparty exposures are discussed 

further in the Exposure 
to Other Select Financial Instruments section.
At October 31, 2010, BMO also held $811 million of securities insured 
by monoline insurers, of which $629 million were municipal bonds 

($901 million and $630 million in 2009). General obligation municipal 

bonds, which have a charge on the taxing authority of the municipality, 

represent 89% of our municipal bond portfolio. Approximately 93% 
64 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&A(91% in 2009) of the municipal bond portfolio is rated investment grade, 
including the benefits of the insu
rance guarantees. Approximately 85% 
(approximately 77% in 2009) of the municipal bond holdings have 

ratings exclusive of the insurance guarantees and all of those are rated 

investment grade.
BMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles
BMO sponsors various vehicles that fund assets originated by either 

BMO (bank securitization vehicles) or its customers (Canadian customer 
securitization vehicles and U.S. customer securitization vehicle). 
We earn fees for providing services related to the securitizations in the 
customer securitization vehicles, including liquidity, distribution and 

financial arrangement fees for supporting the ongoing operations of 

the vehicles. These fees totalled approximately $97 million in 2010 and 

$93 million in 2009. Further disclosure on the impact of IFRS on these 

vehicles is provided on pages 70 to 73.
Bank Securitization Vehicles
Periodically, we sell loans to off-bala
nce sheet entities 
or trusts, either 
for capital management purposes or to obtain alternate sources of 

funding. Gains on sales to the securitization vehicles, as well as revenues 

paid to us for servicing the loans sold, are recognized in income. 
BMO has retained interests in our three bank securitization vehicles, 
as we sometimes choose to or are 
required to purch
ase subordinated 
interests or maintain cash deposits in the entities, and we have also 

recorded deferred purchase price amounts. These latter amounts 

represent the portion of gains on sales to securitization vehicles that 

have not been received in cash. Retained interests recorded as assets 

in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as at October 31, 2010 and 2009 

were $916 million and $1,015 million, respectively. In the event there are 

defaults on certain of the assets held by the vehicles, retained interests 

in those assets may not be fully recoverable and would then be written 

down. In addition, prepayments and changes in interest rates will affect 

the expected cash flows from the vehicles, which may result in partial 
write-downs of retained interests. During the year ended October 31, 

2010, there was a $13 million write-down of retained interests in bank 

securitization vehicles ($12 million of write-downs in 2009).
The assets of two of the vehicles consist of Canadian residential 
mortgages and the third holds Canadian credit card loans transferred 

from BMO. Our investment in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 

of vehicles that hold residential mort
gages was $105 million ($55 million 
in 2009). ABCP issued by the vehicles holding mortgages is rated 

R-1 (high) by DBRS Limited (DBRS) and Prime-1 by Moody’s. We have 
provided $5.1 billion in liquidity facilities to the two vehicles that 

hold residential mortgages and no amounts had been drawn against 

these facilities at October 31, 2010. We have not provided liquidity 
facilities to the vehicle that holds credit card loans as it issues longer-

term asset-backed securities and not ABCP. We hold subordinated notes 

issued by the credit card securitization vehicle with a face value of 

$257 million ($269 million in 2009). The asset-backed securities issued 
to third-party investors by the vehicle holding credit card loans are 
rated AAA by DBRS and Aaa by Moody’s. Further information on the impact
 of securitization activities on the consolidated financial statements is 

outlined in Note 8 on page 126 of the financial statements.
Canadian Customer Securitization Vehicles
The customer securitization vehicles we sponsor in Canada assist our 

customers with the securitization of their assets to provide them with an 

alternate source of funding. These vehicles provide clients with access to 
financing in the ABCP markets by allowing them to sell their assets into 

these vehicles, which then issue ABCP
 to investors to 
fund the purchases.
 In all cases, the sellers continue to service the transferred assets and 

are first to absorb any realized losses on the assets.
Our exposure to losses relates to our investment in ABCP issued by 
the vehicles, derivative contracts we have entered into with the vehicles 

and the liquidity support we provide through backstop liquidity facilities. 
We use our credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter 

into these agreements just as we do when extending credit in the form 

of a loan. 
BMO sometimes enters into derivative contracts with these vehicles 
to enable them to manage their exposures to interest rate and foreign 

exchange rate fluctuations. The fair value of such contracts at October 31, 

2010 was $14 million, which was recorded as a derivative asset in our 

Consolidated Balance Sheet (derivative asset of $44 million in 2009).
Most customer securitization vehicles are funded in the market, 
while some are funded directly by BMO. BMO consolidates the accounts 

of the customer securitization vehicl
es where BMO provides the funding, 
as the majority of the gains or losses of those vehicles are expected to 

accrue to BMO. Included in the total assets of the bank-funded vehicles 

of $290 million at year end were $4 million of mortgage loans with 

subprime or Alt-A characteristics. No losses have been recorded on BMO’s 

exposure to these vehicles.
BMO’s investment in the ABCP of the market-funded vehicles 
totalled $46 million at October 31, 2010 ($328 million in 2009). No losses 

have been recorded on these investments. 
BMO provided liquidity support facilities to the market-funded 
vehicles totalling $3.0 billion at October 31, 2010 ($5.8 billion in 2009). 

This amount comprised part of other credit instruments outlined in 

Note 5 on page 122 of the financial statements. All of these facilities 

remain undrawn. The assets of each of these market-funded customer 

securitization vehicles consist primarily of diversified pools of Canadian 

automobile receivables and Canadian
 residential mortgages. These 
two asset classes represent 65% of the aggregate assets of these vehicles. 
Included in these assets are $210 million of Canadian residential 

mortgage loans with subprime or Alt-A characteristics. 
In the event we choose to or are required to terminate our relation-
ship with a customer securitization vehicle, we would be obligated 

to hold any associated derivatives until their maturity. We would no 

longer receive fees for providing services relating to the securitizations, 

as previously described.
U.S. Customer Securitization Vehicle
We sponsor a U.S. ABCP multi-seller vehicle. This customer securitization 

vehicle assists our customers with t
he securitization of their assets 
to provide them with alternative sources of funding. The vehicle provides 

funding to diversified pools of portfolios through 75 (81 in 2009) 

individual securitization transactions with an average facility size of 

US$59 million. The size of the pools ranged from US$0.7 million to 

US$301 million at October 31, 2010. Residential mortgages classified 

as subprime or Alt-A comprise 0.4% of the portfolio.
Approximately 63% of the vehicle’s commitments have been 
rated by Moody’s or S&P, and almost all of those are rated A or higher. 

Approximately $141 million of the commitments are insured by mono-

lines, primarily MBIA Inc. and Ambac Financial Group. The guarantees 

relate to assets comprising debt secured by middle-market corporate 

loans, state lottery cash flows and pharmaceutical royalty cash flows. 

None of the insurance guarantees involve mortgages, asset-backed 

securities or structured-finance CDOs. The vehicle holds exposures 

secured by a variety of asset classes, including mid-market and corporate 

loans, commercial real estate and auto loans. 
The vehicle had US$3.2 billion of commercial paper outstanding 
at October 31, 2010 (US$4.4 billion in 2009). The ABCP of the vehicle 

is rated A1 by S&P and P1 by Moody’s. BMO has not invested in the 

vehicle’s ABCP. Outstanding commercial paper has consistently been 

purchased by third-party investors, notwithstanding market disruptions 

during the financial crisis, and pricing levels are in line with those of 

top-tier ABCP vehicles in the United States. BMO provides committed 

liquidity support facilities to the vehi
cle. The amount of the facilities was 
US$3.8 billion at October 31, 2010 (US$5.7 billion in 2009), all of which 
was undrawn. During 2010, in accordance with the terms of the supporting
 liquidity agreements, BMO directly funded six of the vehicle’s commercial
 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 65MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Aaccounts that were of lesser credit quality. These six accounts represented
 commitments of US$240 million, of which US$223 million is outstanding. 
Three of the accounts, representing exposure of US$140 million, have 

been classified as impaired and we established a US$45 million provision 

for credit losses in the year. 
BMO is also a counterparty to derivative contracts with the vehicle 
that are used to manage its exposure to interest rates. The fair value 
of derivative contracts outstanding with the vehicle and recorded in our 

Consolidated Balance Sheet was a derivative liability of $2.2 million at 

October 31, 2010 ($1 million in 2009). BMO is not required to consolidate 

the vehicle, as the vehicle has issued an expected-loss note to a third 

party. The holder of the note consolidates the vehicle as the noteholder 

is exposed to the majority of expected losses. 
In the event we choose to or are required to terminate our relation-
ship with the vehicle, we would be required to settle any associated 

derivative contracts at their fair value and would no longer receive fees 

for the administration of the vehicle.
Credit Protection Vehicle
We also sponsor Apex Trust (Apex), a Canadian special purpose vehicle 

that comprises 12 tranches of diversified corporate credits, each of which 

has the benefit of first-loss protection. The 12 tranches in Apex have 

exposure to approximately 440 corporate credits that are diversified by 

geographic region and industry. Approximately 69% of the corporate 

credits are rated investment grade (25.6% rated higher than BBB 

and 43.7% rated BBB) and 30.6% are rated below investment grade. 

The ratings of the majority of the corporate credits have stabilized 

in 2010, with the number on review for downgrade decreasing and 

the number on review for upgrade increasing.
Apex has issued $2.2 billion of notes (Apex Notes) with remaining 
terms of three and six years. 
A senior funding facility of $1.13 billion has been made available 
to Apex, with BMO providing $1.03 billion of that facility. 
BMO has entered into CDS contracts on the net notional positions 
in the structure with the swap counterparties and into offsetting swaps 
with the vehicle. BMO has exposure 
to losses on the notional amount 
above the $3.33 billion total amount of Apex Notes and senior funding 
facility. Based on their notional values, the contracts will expire in 
2012 (24%), 2013 (40%), 2014 (6%) and 2016 (30%).
After giving effect to the hedges we have 
entered into, BMO has 
no net exposure through the Apex Notes to realized
 credit losses in 
the tranches. Realized credit losses in Apex would only be incurred 

should losses on defaults on the u
nderlying credits exceed the first-loss 

protection on a tranche. As detailed below, a significant majority of 

Apex’s positions benefit from substantial first-loss protection. There was 

minimal change in the levels of first-loss protection in 2010. We have 

hedged the first $515 million of loss exposure on our committed expo-

sure under the senior fu
nding facility. As of October 31, 2010, $nil 
($112 million in 2009) was advanced through BMO’s committed share 

of the senior facility to fund collateral calls arising from changes in 

mark-to-market values of the underlying CDSs. 
Two of the 12 tranches have lower levels of first-loss protection 
than the others. If losses were realized by Apex investors on the full 

notional amounts of $1,217 million in the two weakest tranches, BMO’s 

exposure would be $nil, given the hedges that are now in place. Each of 

the other 10 tranches, which have a net notional amount of $20.1 billion, 

is rated from A (low) to AAA and has significant first-loss protection, 

ranging from 13% to 29% with a weighted average of 23.2%.
Structured Investment Vehicles
We hold subordinate capital notes of two BMO London-managed struc-

tured investment vehicles (SIVs), Links Finance Corporation (Links) and 

Parkland Finance Corporation (Parkland), with a carrying value of $nil. 
Our exposure to loss in the SIVs relate
s to our investments in the vehicles, 
derivative contracts we have entered into with the vehicles and senior 

funding we provide through a loan facility that was put in place in order 

to fund the repayment of the SIVs’ senior notes.
The fair value of our derivative contracts outstanding with the SIVs 
was recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as a derivative asset 

of $30 million ($12 million in 2009). We earned investment management 

fees of $2 million and $3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, for 

managing these portfolios.
In the event we choose to or are required to terminate our relation-
ship with these vehicles, any associated derivative contracts would be 

settled at their fair value.
We provide senior-ranked suppo
rt for the funding of Links and 
Parkland through BMO loan facilities, permitting the SIVs to continue the 

strategy of selling assets in an orderly and value-sensitive manner.
At October 31, 2010, amounts drawn on the facilities totalled 
US$4.3 billion and 
€478 million (US$5.8 billion and 
€597 million in 2009).
 The loan facilities totalled US$4.5 billion for Links and 
€508 million for 
Parkland at October 31, 2010. Advances under the loan facilities rank 

ahead of the SIVs’ subordinated capital notes. Consistent with 

the strategy of selling assets in an orderly manner, the pace of asset 

sales was measured throughout 2010 as a result of market conditions. 

We anticipate that the SIVs will continue the strategy of selling assets 

in an orderly manner based upon market conditions and that asset sales 

in the near future will be modest. The total amount drawn under the 

loan facilities is primarily affected by the pace and price of asset sales 

and asset maturities. Amounts funded are expected to decrease from 

current levels based on these factors. We expect asset maturities 

of US$942 million and 
€116 million in 2011 and US$1,450 million and 
€184 million in 2012. The remaining assets mature over time.
The par value of the assets held by Links and Parkland totalled 
US$5.3 billion and 
€624 million, respectively (US$7.1 billion and 

€752 million in 2009). The market value of the assets held by Links and 

Parkland, including hedges and cash equivalents, totalled US$4.4 billion 

and 
€551 million, respectively (US$5.5 billion and 
€631 million in 2009). 

During 2010, there were maturities and repayments of assets totalling 

US$1.1 billion in Links and 
€105 million in Parkland, as well as asset 
sales of US$730 million in Links and 
€44 million in Parkland. The SIVs’ 

capital noteholders will continue to bear the economic risk from actual 

losses up to the full amount of their investment. The book value of 

the subordinated capital notes in Links and Parkland at October 31, 2010 

was US$689 million and 
€141 million, respectively. Subsequent to year 
end, the SIVs recorded impairment charges related to Irish bank and 

insurance company subordinate debt of US$113 million and 
€19 million 
on par values of US$158 million and 
€29 million in Links and Parkland, 
respectively. These charges reduce t
he book value of the subordinated 
capital notes. For both Links and Parkland, BMO believes that the 
first-loss protection provided by the subordinate capital notes continues 

to exceed future expected losses. 
Links holds a portfolio of debt securities including subordinated 
commercial bank debt (43%), CBOs and CLOs with under 
lying assets that 
are primarily corporate obligations (14%), residential mortgage-backed 

securities (16%) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (8%). 

Links has 54% of its assets invested in the United States, 43% in Europe 

and 3% in other countries. Approximately 45% of Links’ debt securities 

are rated Aa3 or better by Moody’s (51% in 2009) with 88% rated invest-

ment grade (91% in 2009). Approximately 39% are rated AA– or better 

by S&P (47% in 2009) with 90% rated investment grade (92% in 2009). 

Parkland has a higher proportion of highly-rated assets than Links, and 

has 64% of its assets invested in Europe, 30% in the United States and 

the remainder in Australia and Canada. Certain debt securities are on 

credit watch for a ratings downgrade. 
66 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AExposure to Other Select Financial Instruments, 
including Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)
The following table provides additional detail on select financial instru-
ments that are held in our trading and available-for-sale portfolios. 

BMO’s portfolios containing CDOs and collateralized loan obligations 

(CLOs) are in run-off mode, resulting in reduced exposures in 2010. Most 

of our CDOs and CLOs are hedged with other large financial institutions. 

Net CDO exposure was minimal at $13 million ($16 million in 2009), and 

net CLO exposure was also minimal at $29 million ($125 million in 2009).
The differences between hedged investment amounts and the 
carrying value of hedged investment amounts reflect mark-to-market 

losses, which can be recovered through total return or credit default 

swaps (CDSs). The underlying securities consist of a wide range of corpo-

rate assets. Approximately 15% of hedged investment amounts have 

been hedged through swaps with a single financial institution rated A. 

The value of BMO’s interest in those hedges is supported by collateral 

held, with the exception of relatively modest amounts as permitted 

under counterparty agreements. Another 60% of hedged investment 
amounts relate to two counterparties rated AA– for which we have 

recorded $94 million of gains on hedging contracts. The remaining 25% 

relate to a counterparty in wind-down mode, for which no gains have 

been recorded on hedging contracts. 
Amounts in the table below exclude CDS protection purchased 
from two credit derivative product company counterparties that has 
a market value of US$68 million (before deduction of US$39 million 

of credit valuation adjustments) and a corresponding US$1.5 billion CDO 

notional value in CDS protection provided to other financial institutions 

in our role as intermediary.
The credit rating of one of the credit derivative product company 
counterparties is Ba1 and the subordinated notes of the other counter-

party are rated Caa1. The underlying 
security on the two exposures 
consists of three pools of broad
ly diversified single-name corporate 
and sovereign credits. Each of the pools has from 90 to 134 credits, of 
which 62% to 83% are investment grade with first-loss protection that 
ranges from 5.9% to 19.2% with a weighted average of 11.1% based on 

notional value.

U.S. Regulatory Developments
On July 21, 2010, U.S. President Obama signed into law the 
Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 (the Dodd-Frank 
Act). The Act is broad in scope and we are assessing the impact of 

the legislation. The reforms include heightened consumer protection, 

regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, restrictions 

on proprietary trading by banks (referred to as the Volcker Rule), 

imposition of heightened prudential standards and broader application 

of leverage and risk-based capital requirements, greater supervision 
of systemically significant payment, clearing or settlement systems, 
restrictions on interchange fees, and the creation of a new financial 
stability oversight council of regulators with the objective of increasing 

stability by monitoring systemic risks posed by financial services 

companies and their activities. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are 

subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making 

it difficult to anticipate at this time the overall impact on us or the 

financial services industry more generally. We anticipate an increase 

in compliance costs and regulatory enforcement, and will be focused 

on managing the impact, particularly on our U.S. business, of 

regulatory changes given their complexity and breadth. 
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 67MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AThe Notes to BMO’s October 31, 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements 
outline our significant accounting estimates. The following accounting 

estimates are considered particularly important, as they require signifi-

cant judgments by management. Management has established detailed 

policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these 

judgments are well controlled, independently reviewed and consistently 

applied from period to period. We believe that our estimates of the 

value of BMO’s assets and liabilities are appropriate.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses adjusts the value of loans to reflect their 

estimated realizable value. In assess
ing their estimated realizable value, 
we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters 

for which the ultimate outcome is unknown. These include economic 

factors, developments affecting companies in particular industries and 

specific issues with respect to single borrowers. Changes in circum-

stances may cause future assessments of credit risk to be materially 

different from current assessments, which could require an increase 

or decrease in the allowance for credit losses.
One of our key performance measures is the provision for credit 
losses as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances. Over 

the past 10 years, for our Canadian 
peer group, the average annual ratio 
has ranged from a high of 1.24% in 2002 to a low of 0.17% in 2004. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
BMO enters into a number of off-balance sheet arrangements in the 

normal course of operations. Our arrangements with certain variable 

interest entities are addressed on pages 64 to 66 and 68 to 69 of 

this MD&A. The discussion that follows addresses our remaining 

off-balance sheet arrangements. 
Credit Instruments
In order to meet the financial needs of our clients, we use a variety 

of off-balance sheet credit instruments. These include guarantees and 

standby letters of credit, which represent our obligation to make pay-

ments to third parties on behalf of a customer if the customer is unable 

to make the required payments or meet other contractual requirements. 

We also write documentary and commercial letters of credit, which 

represent our agreement to honour drafts presented by a third party 

upon completion of specified activities. Commitments to extend 

credit are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent our commit-

ment to customers to grant them credit in the form of loans or other 

financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to meeting 

certain conditions.
There are a large number of credit instruments outstanding at 
any time. Our customers are broadly 
diversified and we do not anticipate 
events or conditions that would cause a significant number of our cus-

tomers to fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contracts. 

We use our credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter into 

these arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form 

of a loan. We monitor off-balance sheet instruments to avoid undue 

concentrations in any geographic region or industry.
The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these 
credit instruments was approximately $65 billion at October 31, 2010 

($73 billion in 2009). However, this amount is not representative of 

our likely credit exposure or liquid
ity requirements for these instruments 
as it does not take into account customer behaviour, which suggests 

only a portion will utilize the facility. It also does not take into account 

any amounts that could be recovered under recourse or collateralization 

provisions. Further information on these instruments can be found in 

Note 5 on page 122 of the financial statements.
For the credit commitments outlined in the preceding paragraphs, 
in the absence of an event that t
riggers a default, early termination 
by BMO may result in a breach of contract.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
Our interests in VIEs are discussed primarily on pages 64 to 66 in the 

BMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles and Structured Investment 
Vehicles sections and on pages 68 to 69 in the Accounting for Variable 

Interest Entities section. Capital and funding trusts are discussed below.
Capital and Funding Trusts
BMO Subordinated Notes Trust (SN Trust) issued $800 million of BMO 

Trust Subordinated Notes (SN Trust Notes) in 2007, the proceeds of 

which were used to purchase a senior deposit note from BMO. We hold 

all of the outstanding voting trust units in SN Trust and expect to do 
so at all times while the SN Trust Notes are outstanding. We are not 
required to consolidate SN Trust. BMO does not expect to terminate 

SN Trust while the SN Trust Notes are outstanding, unless SN Trust has 

sufficient funds to pay the redemption price on the SN Trust Notes 

and only with the approval of OSFI. We provide a $30 million credit 

facility to SN Trust, of which $5 million had been drawn at October 31, 
2010 ($5 million in 2009). We guarantee payment of the principal, 
interest, redemption price, if any,
 and any other amounts on the 
SN Trust Notes on a subordinated basis.
During 2009, BMO Capital Trust II (Trust II) was created to raise 
capital, through the issuance of $450 million of BMO Tier 1 Notes 
Œ Series A. Trust II used the proceeds of
 the offering to purchase a senior 
deposit note from BMO. We are not required to consolidate Trust II.
Guarantees
Guarantees include contracts under which we may be required to 

make payments to a counterparty based on changes in the value of an 

asset, liability or equity security that the counterparty holds. Contracts 

under which we may be required to make payments if a third party 

does not perform according to the terms of a contract and contracts 

under which we provide indirect guarantees of indebtedness are also 

considered guarantees. In the normal course of business, we enter 

into a variety of guarantees, including standby letters of credit, backstop 

and other liquidity facilities and derivatives contracts or instruments 

(including, but not limited to, credit default swaps and written options), 

as well as indemnification agreements.
The maximum amount payable was $65 billion at October 31, 2010 
($82 billion in 2009). However, this amount is not representative of our 

likely exposure, as it does not take into account customer behaviour, 

which suggests that only a portion of the guarantees will require 

payment. It also does not take into account any amounts that could 

be recovered through recourse and collateral provisions.
For a more detailed discussion of these agreements, please see 
Note 7 on page 125 of the financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
68 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AThis ratio varies with changes in the economy and credit conditions. 
If we were to apply these high and low ratios to average net loans and 

acceptances in 2010, our provision for credit losses would range from 

$2,127 million to $292 million. Our provision for credit losses in 2010 

was $1,049 million.
Additional information on the process and methodology for 
determining the allowance for credit losses can be found in the discus-

sion of credit risk on page 80 as well as in Note 4 on page 120 of the 

financial statements.
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value
BMO records securities and derivatives at their fair value. Fair value 

represents our estimate of the am
ount we would receive, or would 
have to pay in the case of a derivative liability, in a current transaction 

between willing parties. We employ a fair value hierarchy to categorize 

the inputs we use in valuation techniques to measure fair value. 

The extent of our use of quoted ma
rket prices (Level 1), internal models 
using observable market information (Level 2) and internal models 

without observable market information (Level 3) in the valuation of 
securities, derivative assets and derivative liabilities as at October 31, 2010, 
as well as a sensitivity analysis of our Level 3 assets, is disclosed in 

Note 29 on page 160 of the financial statements.
Valuation models use general assumptions and market data, and 
therefore do not reflect the specific risks and other factors that would 

affect a particular instrument’s fair value. As a result, we incorporate 

certain adjustments when using internal models to establish fair values. 

These fair value adjustments take into account the estimated impact 

of credit risk, liquidity risk, valuation considerations, administrative costs 

and closeout costs. For example, the credit risk adjustment for derivative 

financial instruments incorporates credit risk into our determination of 
fair values by taking into account factors such as the counterparty’s credit 

rating, the duration of the instrument and changes in credit spreads.
Valuation Product Control (VPC), a group independent of the trading 
lines of business, verifies the fair values at which financial instruments 
are recorded. For instruments that are valued using models, VPC identifies 
situations where valuation adjustments must be made to the model 

estimates to arrive at fair value.
The methodologies used for calculating these adjustments are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain appropriate. 

Significant changes in methodologies are rare and are made only when 

we believe that the change will result in better estimates of fair value.

were lower in 2010. The decrease in the adjustment for credit risk 

was due to narrower relative credit spreads between our counterparties 

and BMO. 
Accounting for Securitizations
When loans are securitized, we record a gain or loss on sale. In deter-

mining the gain or loss, management must estimate the net present 

value of expected future cash flows by relying on estimates of the 

amount of interest and fees that will be collected on the securitized 

assets, the yield to be paid to inve
stors, the portion of the securitized 
assets that will be repaid before their scheduled maturity, credit losses, 
the fair value cost of servicing and the rate at which to discount these 
estimated future cash flows. Actual cash flows may differ significantly 
from those estimated by management. If management’s estimate of 
future cash flows were different, our gain on securitization recognized 
in income would also be different.
Additional information concerning accounting for securitizations, 
including a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions, is included in Note 8 

on page 126 of the financial statements. 
Accounting for Variable Interest Entities
In the normal course of business, BMO enters into arrangements with 

variable interest entities (VIEs). VIEs include entities where the equity is 

considered insufficient to finance the entity’s activities or for which 

the equityholders do not have a controlling financial interest. We are 

required to consolidate VIEs if the investments we hold in these entities 

and/or the relationships we have with them result in us being exposed 

to a majority of their expected losses and/or being able to benefit from 

a majority of their expected residual returns.
We determine whether an entity is a VIE and whether BMO holds 
a variable interest in that VIE based primarily on quantitative analysis. 

We perform a variety of complex estimation processes involving qualita-

tive and quantitative factors to calculate and analyze a VIE’s expected 
losses and expected residual returns. These processes involve estimating 

the future cash flows and performance of the VIE, analyzing the variability 
of those cash flows and allocating the expected losses and expected 

residual returns among the identified parties holding variable interests. 
The analysis enables us to identify the party that is exposed to a majority 

of the VIE’s expected losses and/or expected residual returns, and thus 
determine which party should consolidate the entity.
We are required to reconsider if consolidation is required when our 
obligation to absorb expected losses or right to receive expected residual 

returns increases. If there is a change in events that leads to BMO 

absorbing the majority of the expected losses or residual returns, BMO 

would be required to consolidate the VIE as of the date of the change.
With respect to the credit protection vehicle Apex, reconsideration 
events include BMO purchasing additional Notes, granting additional 

liquidity facilities, increasing the amount of the loan extended by BMO 

beyond what is contemplated under the 
existing credit lending facilities, 
or guaranteeing repayment of Apex Notes held by third parties. Each of 

these reconsideration events could result in BMO absorbing additional 

expected losses or residual returns. We do not expect that such reconsid-

eration events will occur in the near future.
With respect to the structured investment vehicles Links and 
Parkland, reconsideration events include a purchase or sale by BMO 

of capital notes, provision of additional lending facilities, renegotiation 

of the loan facility provided by BMO, asset for capital note exchanges 

and provision of a guarantee by BMO to compensate noteholders for 

realized losses. The reconsideration event that is most likely to occur 

is a renegotiation of certain terms in our lending facilities. If we were to 

renegotiate certain terms of our lending facilities, we would not expect 

to consolidate the vehicles based on our current assessment of our 

exposure to expected losses.
Reconsideration events for our Canadian multi-seller conduits 
include the purchase or sale by BMO 
of ABCP issued by the vehicles and 

the granting of additional liquidity facilities or credit enhancement. Since 

BMO regularly purchases and sells ABCP issued by our Canadian multi-

seller conduits, we continually monitor our exposure to expected losses 

to ensure they do not approach consolidation thresholds.
Reconsideration events for our U.S. multi-seller conduit include 
the granting of additional liquidity facilities or credit enhancement 

and a change in the size of the expected loss note. Repayment of the 

expected loss note would also be a reconsideration event and a third 

party would have to agree to absorb the exposure to the majority 

of the expected losses. Otherwise, BMO would be required to consolidate 

the vehicle. We monitor BMO’s exposure to expected losses as recon-

sideration events occur and increase the expected loss note so that 

consolidation is not required.
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 69MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AAdditional information concerning BMO’s involvement with variable 
interest entities is included on pages 64 to 66 as well as in Note 9 on 
page 128 of the financial statements.
Pension and Other Employee Future Benefits
BMO’s pension and other employee future benefits expense is calculated 
by our independent actuaries using assumptions determined by 
management. If actual experience differs from the assumptions used, 

pension and other employee future benefits expense could increase or 

decrease in future years. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a 

management estimate that significantly affects the calculation of pen-

sion expense. Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined 

using the plan’s target asset allocation and estimated rates of return for 

each asset class. Estimated rates of return are based on expected returns 

from fixed-income securities, which take into consideration bond yields. 

An equity risk premium is then applied to estimate equity returns. 

Expected returns from other asset classes are established to reflect the 

risks of these asset classes relative to fixed-income and equity assets. 

The impact of changes in expected rates of return on plan assets is not 

significant for our other employee future benefits expense since only 

small amounts of assets are held in these plans.
Pension and other employee future benefits expense and obligations 
are also sensitive to changes in discount rates. We determine discount 

rates at each year end for our Canadian and U.S. plans using high-quality 

corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.
Additional information regarding our accounting for pension 
and other employee future benefits, including a sensitivity analysis 

for key assumptions, is included in Note 23 on page 149 of the 

financial statements.
Other Than Temporary Impairment
We have investments in securities issued or guaranteed by Canadian 

or U.S. governments, corporate debt and equity securities, mortgage-

backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are 

classified as available-for-sale securities. We review available-for-sale 

and other securities at each quarter-end reporting period to identify 

and evaluate investments that show indications of possible impairment. 
An investment is considered impaired if an unrealized loss on the security
 represents impairment that is considered to be other than temporary. 

In making this assessment, we consider such factors as the type of 

investment, the length of time and 
extent to which the fair value has 
been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the 

issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment long enough 

to allow for any anticipated recove
ry. The decision to record a write-
down, its amount and the period in which it is recorded could change 
if management’s assessment of those factors were different. We do not 
record impairment write-downs on debt securities when impairment 

is due to changes in market interest rates, since we expect to realize the 

full value of these investments by holding them until maturity or when 

they recover in value.
At the end of 2010, there were total unrealized losses of $25 million 
on securities for which cost exceeded fair value and an impairment 

write-down had not been recorded. Of this amount, $10 million related 

to securities for which cost had exceeded fair value for 12 months or 

more. These unrealized losses resulted from increases in market interest 

rates and not from deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer.
Additional information regarding our accounting for available-for-
sale securities and other securities a
nd the determination of fair value 
is included in Note 3 on page 116 of the financial statements.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax 

treatment of transactions recorded in our Consolidated Statements of 

Income or Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. In determining the provision 

for income taxes, we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions 
and make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of 

future tax assets and liabilities. If our interpretations differ from those of 

tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as anticipated, our pro-

vision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. The 
amount of any such increase or 
decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.
Additional information regarding our accounting for income taxes 
is included in Note 24 on page 155 of the financial statements.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. This assessment 

includes a comparison of the carrying value and the fair value of each 

group of businesses to ensure that the fair value of the group is greater 

than its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of 

the group, a more detailed goodwill impairment assessment would 

have to be undertaken. In determining fair value, we employ internal 

valuation models such as discounted cash flow models consistent with 

those used when we acquire businesses. These models are dependent 

on assumptions related to revenue growth, discount rates, synergies 

achieved on acquisitions and the availability of comparable acquisition 

data. Changes in each of these assumptions will affect the determination 

of fair value for each of the business units in a different manner. 

Management must exercise judgment and make assumptions in deter-

mining fair value, and differences in judgments and assumptions could 

affect the determination of fair value and any resulting impairment 

write-down. At October 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of each of our 

groups of businesses was greater than its carrying value.
Intangible assets are amortized to income on either a straight-line 
or an accelerated basis over a period not exceeding 15 years, depending 

on the nature of the asset. There are no intangible assets with indefinite 

lives. We test intangible assets for impairment when circumstances 

indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. No such impairment 

was identified for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Additional information regarding the composition of goodwill 
and intangible assets is included in Note 13 on page 138 of the finan-

cial statements.
Insurance-related Liabilities
Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims 

and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for life 

insurance contracts are determined using the Canadian Asset Liability 

Method, which incorporates best-estimate assumptions for mortality, 

morbidity, policy lapses, surrenders, future investment yields, policy 

dividends, administration costs and margins for adverse deviation. These 

assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual 

experience and market conditions. The most significant impact on the 

liability results from a change in the assumption on future investment 

yields. Future investment yields may be sensitive to variations in 

reinvestment interest rates and impact the valuation of policy benefit 

liabilities accordingly. If the assumed yield were to increase by one per-

centage point, net income would increase by approximately $77 million. 

A reduction of one percentage point would decrease net income by 

approximately $71 million.
Contingent Liabilities
BMO and its subsidiaries are involv
ed in various legal actions in the 
ordinary course of business.
Contingent litigation loss provisions are recorded when it becomes 
likely that BMO will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably 

estimated. BMO’s management and internal and external experts are 

involved in assessing any such like
lihood and estimating any amounts 
involved. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially 

higher or lower than the amounts provided. Additional information 

regarding contingent liabilities can be found in Note 28 on page 159 

of the financial statements.

MD&AChanges in Accounting Policies in 2010
There were no changes in accounting policies in 2010.
Future Changes in Accounting Policies 
Œ IFRSTransition to International Financial Reporting Standards
Canadian public companies will be required to prepare their financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. 

Effective November 1, 2011, we will adopt IFRS as the basis for preparing 

our consolidated financial statements. We will report our financial results 
for the quarter ending January 31, 2012, prepared on an IFRS basis. 
We will also provide comparative data on an IFRS basis, including an 

opening balance sheet as at November 1, 2010 (transition date).
IFRS Transition Plan and Current Status
In order to meet the requirement to transition to IFRS, we established 

an enterprise-wide project and formed an Executive Steering Committee. 

The transition plan is comprised of three phases: a diagnostic review 

and assessment to identify potential differences between IFRS and the 

bank’s current accounting policies; implementation and education, which 

includes confirming actual differences between IFRS and the bank’s 

current accounting policies; and completion of all integration require-

ments for actual differences identified.
Phase I Œ Diagnostic Review and Assessment
The primary objective of Phase I was to complete a comprehensive 

review of the IFRS requirements relative to the bank’s current accounting 

policies in order to identify potential differences. This analysis identified 

the scope of the work required, allowing for the completion of a detailed 

implementation plan including timelines and resource requirements.
CURRENT STATUS
A detailed implementation plan was developed and approved by the IFRS 
Executive Steering Committee in 2009. Potential differences between IFRS 

and the bank’s current accounting policies have been fully documented.
Phase II Œ Implementation and Education
The key elements of Phase II include: confirming actual differences 

between IFRS and the bank’s current accounting policies and selecting 

policy options permitted under IFRS; identifying and implementing the 
necessary changes within our existing financial reporting and data collection 
processes and technology; assessing the impact on internal controls 

over financial reporting and disclosure; designing and implementing 

a technology-based solution to track and record IFRS-based financial 

information for the 2011 reporting year for comparative purposes; and 

developing and executing internal training and awareness programs to 
ensure sufficient financial reporting 
expertise and governance. Substantial 
completion of Phase II activities is expected in the first quarter of 2011.
CURRENT STATUS
Confirmation of Actual Differences and Implementation Requirements 

The implementation activities have been organized by individual work 

streams (25 in total). We have substantially completed ten work 

streams: capital assets, leases, stock-based compensation, intangible 

assets, revenue recognition, foreign currency translation, earnings per 

share, borrowing costs, investment properties and business combina-

tions. Based on our analysis to date, these work streams have not 

revealed any material differences relative to current BMO accounting 

practices. The remaining 15 work streams are all well advanced. Progress 

on the work streams related to the main accounting changes is outlined 

in the following section.
The transition plan contemplates substantial completion of all work 
streams by the first quarter of 2011; however, we continue to closely 
monitor the work of the IASB on any changes to existing IFRS and adjust 

our project plan to reflect these developments. 
Quantification of Key Impacts
The differences between the bank’s accounting policies and IFRS require-

ments, combined with our decisions on the optional IFRS 1 exemptions 

from retroactive application of IFRS, will result in measurement and 

recognition differences when we transition to IFRS. The net impact 

of these differences will be recorded in opening retained earnings, 

affecting shareholders’ equity. The acco
unting differences noted in the 
following section, Identification of Differences between the Bank’s 

Current Accounting Policies and the Requirements under IFRS, should not 

be considered a comprehensive list of the impacts of adopting IFRS, but 

rather the identification of certain key changes based on our analysis 

to date. Precisely quantifying all of the impacts that will result from 

adopting IFRS will be subject to the completion of all our project work 

streams, finalization of all decisions where choices of accounting policies 

are available, including optional exemptions from retroactive restate-

ment available under IFRS 1, and the prevailing market conditions and 

economic circumstances at the time of transition.
In response to the financial reporting issues emerging from the 
global financial crisis, the IASB plans to make revisions to or replace 

certain existing IFRS standards. In particular, we expect that there will be 

changes in the standards that address securities, hedging, provisions for 

credit losses, consolidation, pension and other employee future benefits, 

leases and insurance contracts. We do not expect any of these changes 

to be in effect until after the bank’s date of transition, with the result 

that the impact of adopting IFRS will extend beyond our transitional year. 

We continue to monitor and evaluate these potential future changes.
Identification of Differences between the Bank’s Current Accounting 
Policies and the Requirements under IFRS
Based on our analysis to date, the main accounting changes that 
will result from the adoption of IFRS are expected to be in the areas 

of pension and other employee future benefits, asset securitization, 

consolidation and accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation 

of foreign operations. The IFRS requirements associated with these areas 

differ from current BMO accounting policies such that there will likely 

be impacts on the bank’s balance sheets and statements of income. 

These impacts will also extend to our capital ratios. Other significant 

differences may be identified prior 
to our transition to IFRS. The 
differences described in the sections that follow are based on Canadian 

GAAP and IFRS that are in effect as of this date.
OSFI has issued an IFRS advisory that permits a five-quarter phase-in 
of the adjustment to retained earnings arising from the first-time adoption 

of 
certain IFRS requirements for purposes of calculating certain ratios. 
Transitional relief for the impact on the Assets-to-Capital Multiple will 
also be provided in the form of excluding the effect of any on-balance 

sheet recognition of mortgages that were sold through Canada Mortgage 

and Housing Corporation (CMHC) programs up to March 31, 2010. 
Pension and Other Employee Future Benefits
Under the IFRS employee benefits standard (IAS 19), we will continue 

to record pension and other employee future benefits expense as 

the cost of benefits earned in the year plus the interest cost on the 

obligation, net of the expected return on assets. IFRS provides two alter-

natives for how to account for the unrealized market-related gains or 

losses on pension fund assets and the impact of changes in discount 

rates on pension obligations (market-related amounts). We can either 
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 71MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Arecord these market-related amounts directly in equity or defer them 
on our balance sheet and amortize amounts in excess of 10% of our plan 

assets or benefit liability balances to pension expense over a period 

of approximately 12 years. We currently follow the second alternative. 

We have not yet finalized our decision on which alternative to elect for 

the accounting of market-related amounts. Additional information on 

our pension and other employee future benefits is included in Note 23 

on page 149 of the financial statements.
On transition to IFRS, we can either recalculate pension expense 
back to inception of the plans as though we had always applied the IFRS 

pension requirements or, alternativ
ely, record market-related amounts 
that exist on November 1, 2010 directly in retained earnings (fresh 

start method). 
Should the bank elect the fresh start method, the result would 
be a reduction in retained earnings of approximately $1,200 million, a 

decrease in other assets of approximately $1,600 million and a decrease 

in other liabilities of approximately $400 million on November 1, 2010, 

the beginning of our comparative year. This would result in approxi-

mately a 65 basis point reduction in our Tier 1 Capital Ratio, which would 

be phased in over five quarters as permitted under OSFI’s IFRS advisory. 

Adopting this alternative would also result in reduced pension expense 

in future years since any deferred losses that exist on October 31, 2010 

would not be amortized to pension expense.
We have not yet finalized our decision on whether to elect the 
fresh start method as permitted under IFRS.
Asset Securitization
We have substantially completed our assessment of certain of our signif-
icant asset securitization programs and whether the loans and mortgages
 sold through these programs qualify for off-balance sheet treatment 

under IFRS. The assessment included our Canadian credit card loans and 

Canadian mortgage loans sold to the bank’s securitization vehicles and 

to the Canada Mortgage Bond program, a third-party securitization 

program. We assessed whether the loans and mortgages qualify for off-

balance sheet treatment based on the transfer of the risks and rewards, 

as determined under the derecognition criteria contained in the IFRS 

financial instruments standard (IAS 39). Based on the analysis completed 

to date, our preliminary conclusion is that the loans or mortgages sold 

under these securitization programs will not qualify for off-balance sheet 

recognition under IFRS. Under Canadian GAAP, the mortgages and loans 

sold through these programs are removed from our balance sheet. 

Additional information on our asset securitization vehicles is included 

in Note 8 on page 126 of the financial statements.
If the securitized assets sold to the securitization vehicles noted 
in the preceding paragraph were to be recognized on the bank’s balance 

sheet, assets and liabilities would increase by approximately $18 billion 
and opening retained earnings would be reduced by less than $100 mil 
lion on November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year. The reduc-
tion in retained earnings primarily represents the reversal of the gain 
on sale previously recognized in earnings. The interest and fees collected
 from customers, net of the yield paid
 to investors in the securitization 
vehicle, would be recorded in net interest income using the effective 

interest rate method over the term of the securiti 
zation and credit losses 
associated with loans and mortgages would be recorded in the provision 

for credit losses. The reduction in retained earnings would result in less 

than a 5 basis point reduction in our Tier 1 Capital Ratio, which would be 

phased in over five quarters, as permitted under OSFI’s IFRS advisory. 
We expect to complete our assessment of the asset securitization 
activity associated with selling the bank’s Canadian mortgage loans to 

certain other third-party asset securitization programs in the first and 

second quarters of 2011. 
The IASB’s project to revise the accounting requirements for securi-
tization activities is currently on hold. We do not expect the existing 

accounting requirements impacting asset securitization to change prior 

to the bank’s transition to IFRS in 2012.
Consolidation
We have substantially completed our assessment of whether we are 

required to consolidate our credit protection vehicle and our structured 

investment vehicles when we transition to IFRS. We assessed the con-

solidation requirement based on whether the bank would in substance 

control the vehicles, as determined under the criteria contained in the 

IFRS consolidated and separate financial statements standard (IAS 27) 

and, where appropriate, SIC-12 (an interpretation of IAS 27). Our analysis 
considered whether the activities of the vehicles are conducted on 

behalf of the bank, the bank’s exposu
re to the risks and benefits, its 
decision-making powers over the vehicles, and whether these consider-

ations demonstrate that the bank, in substance, controls the vehicles 

and therefore must consolidate them.
Information on these vehicles, including total assets, our exposure 
to loss and our assessment of t
he consolidation requirement under 
Canadian GAAP, is included in Note 9 on page 128 of the financial 

statements. 
Credit Protection Vehicle 
Œ Based on the analysis completed to date, our 
preliminary conclusion is that the bank would be required to consolidate 
this vehicle, as our analysis indicates that the bank, in substance, 

controls this vehicle, based on the definition of control under IFRS. 
Under Canadian GAAP, we are not required to consolidate this vehicle.
Consolidation of this vehicle would impact the bank’s balance 
sheet, increasing assets and liabilities by approximately $500 million on 

November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year. Our estimate 

incorporates the elections permitted under IFRS to fair value certain 

assets and liabilities of the credit protection vehicle, with changes in 

the fair value recorded in income as they occur. We do not expect any 

significant volatility in the bank’s net income under IFRS as a result of 

the fair value election, unless there is a significant downturn in market 

conditions, as any changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

will largely offset each other as a result of the hedges the bank has put 

in place. The risk of volatility in net income will be reduced over time as 

the CDS contracts held by the vehicle mature. Based on their notional 

values, the contracts will expire as follows: 24% in fiscal 2012, 40% in 

fiscal 2013, 6% in fiscal 2014 and 30% in fiscal 2016. 
Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) 
Œ Based on the analysis completed 
to date, our preliminary conclusion is that the bank would be required to 

consolidate the SIVs, as our analysis indicates that the bank, in substance, 

controls the SIVs, based on the definition of control under IFRS. Under 

Canadian GAAP, we are not required to consolidate the SIVs.
Consolidation of the SIVs would increase assets and liabilities on 
the bank’s balance sheet by approximately $200 million on November 1, 

2010, the beginning of our comparative 
year. This represents the amount  
by which the assets of the SIVs ex
ceed the amount drawn on the loan 
facility the bank has made available to the SIVs as of November 1, 2010. 

Our estimate incorporates the 
election permitted under IFRS to fair 
value the assets and liabilities of t
he SIVs, with changes in the fair value 
recorded in income as they occur. We do not expect any significant 

volatility in the bank’s net income under IFRS as a result of the fair value 

election, unless there is a significant downturn in market conditions, 

as any changes in the fair value of the assets should be largely offset by 

changes in the fair value of the capital notes. The risk of volatility in net 

income will be reduced over time as the assets held by the vehicles 

mature. Based on their par value, we expect that 47% of the assets will 

mature by the end of fiscal 2012, 14% in fiscal 2013, 10% in fiscal 2014, 

12% in 2015 and 17% between 2016 and 2028.
The risk-weighted assets of the vehicles noted above are already 
included in the current determination of the bank’s risk-weighted assets. 

In addition, we do not expect the consolidation of these vehicles would 

result in any significant adjustment to opening retained earnings. As a 

result, we do not expect that consolidating any of these vehicles would 

have a significant impact on the calculation of our Tier 1 Capital Ratio. 
72 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AWe expect to complete our assessment of our U.S. customer 
securitization vehicle and our Canadian customer securitization vehicles 
and other less significant VIEs in the first and second quarters of 2011. 

If we were to consolidate our U.S. customer securitization vehicle and/or 

our Canadian customer securitization vehicles, we do not expect that this 

would result in any significant adjustment to opening retained earnings 

on November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year.
The IASB is scheduled to release a revised consolidation standard 
in 2011. It is unclear when adoption will be required; however, we expect 

that the existing consolidation standard will remain in place when the 

bank transitions to IFRS in 2012.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on Translation of 
Foreign Operations
On transition to IFRS, we can either recalculate translation differences 
on an IFRS basis as though we had always applied the IFRS requirements 

or reset the accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation of net 

foreign operations to zero.
We expect to elect to reset our accumulated other comprehensive 
loss on translation of net foreign operations to zero. The impact on the 

bank’s balance sheet will be an increase of approximately $1,100 million 

in accumulated other comprehensive income and a corresponding 

reduction in retained earnings of approximately $1,100 million on 

November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year. There will 

be no regulatory capital impact associated with this change.
IFRS 1 Œ First-Time Adoption of IFRS
IFRS 1 is a financial reporting standard that provides the framework for 

the transition to IFRS. The general principle under IFRS 1 is retroactive 
application, such that our opening balance sheet for the comparative year 
financial statements is to be restated as though the bank had always 
applied IFRS with the net impact shown as an adjustment to opening 

retained earnings. However, IFRS 1 contains certain mandatory exceptions 

and permits certain optional exemptio
ns from full retroactive application. 
The mandatory exceptions include hedge accounting. We will not look 

back in time to determine whether we complied with IFRS hedge 

accounting requirements prior to transition. As long as we comply with 
IFRS on November 1, 2010, we can continue our hedge accounting without 
interruption. We have completed our assessment and have made the 
necessary changes so that hedge accounting will continue under IFRS. 
We are currently evaluating the optional exemptions under IFRS 1, 

the most significant of which are discussed in the following sections.
Business Combinations
The IFRS business combinations standard (IFRS 3) provides guidance on 

the measurement and recognition of business acquisitions that differs 

from the guidance under Canadian GAAP.
IFRS requires all costs related to acquisition and restructuring to be 
expensed. Canadian GAAP permits the capitalization of certain of these 

costs. In addition, when consideration is paid to the seller in the form 

of shares issued by the buyer, the co
nsideration is valued based on the 
market price of the shares at the closing date. Under Canadian GAAP, 

that valuation is based on an average of the market price of the shares 

over a reasonable period before a
nd after the date the terms of the 
acquisition are agreed to and announced. These differences would affect 

the purchase price allocation, including the amount of goodwill recorded.
IFRS 1 permits the application of the requirements in IFRS 3 to 
business acquisitions that are completed after the transition to IFRS 

(November 1, 2010) or retroactively back to a date of our choosing. 

Should we choose to adopt and apply IFRS 3 retroactively, we would be 

required to restate all past acquisitions from the date chosen up to our 

transition date.

 Policies and the Requirements under IFRS.

Policies and the Requirements under IFRS.
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting and Disclosure
We have determined that there will not be a significant impact on our 

internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and 

procedures resulting from the transition to IFRS. We will develop internal 

controls over tracking and communicating IFRS-based information for 

the IFRS comparative year, changes in the accounting treatment of the 

bank’s VIEs and securitized loans and certain additional disclosure 

requirements in the notes to the financial statements. These internal 

control modifications will be a key area of focus in the third and final 

phase of the transition, which begins in the first quarter of 2011.
Business Activities
On an ongoing basis, we assess whether there will be any impact 

on our business activities as we progress through our implementation 

activities. We are reviewing loan agreements and related loan covenant 

ratios in situations where our loan customers are also adopting IFRS. 

To date, we have not identified any other significant impacts on existing 

business activities that will result from adopting IFRS.
Information Technology
We have completed a detailed assessment of our existing financial 

information technology architecture and determined that no significant 

changes are required as a result of our transition to IFRS. We have 

developed a technology-based solution in the form of a comparative 

reporting tool that will track IFRS-based financial information during 

the comparative year. This will not require any significant modification 

to our existing financial reporting systems. The comparative reporting 

tool is currently undergoing testing and will be operational in the first 

quarter of 2011. 
Financial Reporting Expertise and Governance
An internal IFRS educational program was launched in 2009 to ensure 

appropriate financial reporting expertise and governance when the bank 

begins to report on an IFRS basis. During 2009, detailed technical sessions 

relating to our findings in Phase I were presented to all our accounting 

and finance staff as well as certain other functional groups across the 
enterprise that may be affected by the transition to IFRS. We also launched, 
in 2009, training and awareness programs for our credit personnel 

who need to understand the impact of IFRS as they relate to any loan 

or credit customers that may also be adopting IFRS. In 2010, updated 

technical sessions were provided to the bank’s accounting and finance 

staff and other groups directly impacted by the conversion to IFRS. 

Quarterly educational sessions on specific IFRS topics were presented 

to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors in 2009 and 2010.
Phase III Œ Completion of Integration Changes
We are developing a detailed plan for the third and final phase of the 

transition, the completion of all integration changes, which is scheduled 

to commence in 2011. This will include the development of controls and 

procedures necessary to restate our 2011 opening balance sheet and 

financial results on an IFRS basis in preparation for the transition to IFRS 

in fiscal 2012, finalizing decisions on policy options available under IFRS 

(such as exemptions from applying certain IFRS requirements on a retro-

active basis), the development of plans to communicate to our internal 

and external stakeholders and an assessment of impacts on our internal 

management reporting processes, including planning and forecasting.

 73MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&ADisclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to 

senior management, including the President & Chief Executive Officer 

(CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), on a timely basis so that 

appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of 
our disclosure controls and procedures was conducted as at October 31, 

2010 by BMO Financial Group’s management under the supervision 

of the CEO and the CFO. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO 

have concluded that, as at October 31, 2010, our disclosure controls 

and procedures, as defined in Canada by National Instrument 52-109, 

Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings, and 

in the United States by Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934
 (the Exchange Act), are effective.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reason-

able assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Canadian 

generally accepted accounting principles and the requirements of the 

Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, as applicable. 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 

internal control over financial reporting for BMO Financial Group.
BMO’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and 
procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reason-

able detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 

of the assets of BMO; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements 

in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
and the requirements of the Securitie
s and Exchange Commission in the 
United States, as applicable, and that receipts and expenditures of BMO 

are being made only in accordance with authorizations by management 

and directors of BMO; and provide reasonable assurance regarding 

prevention or timely detection of t
he unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of BMO’s assets that could have a material effect on the 

financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or 

detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of 

effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 

become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 

of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
BMO Financial Group’s management, under the supervision of the 
CEO and the CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control 

over financial reporting using the framework and criteria established in 

Internal Control 
Œ Integrated Framework
, issued by the Committee of 

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this 

evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over 

financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2010.
BMO Financial Group’s auditors, 
KPMG LLP (Shareholders’ Auditors), 
an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit 

report on our internal control over financial reporting. This audit report 

appears on page 111.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

us maintain our solid financial position. We continue to expand our risk 
management infrastructure, build our capabilities and pursue continuous 

improvement while actively benchmarking our capabilities against risk 

management best practices. We believe that the steps we have taken, 

and the initiatives we continue to
 pursue, have positioned us appropri-
ately to move forward and execute our strategy.
Our enterprise integrated risk management framework includes 
our operating model and our risk governance structure, both of which 

are underpinned by our risk culture. Our framework is predicated on 

the three-lines-of-defence approach to the management of risk. This is 

fundamental to our operating model. 
The first line of defence in our 
management of risk is our operating groups, which are responsible for 
the risks in their business. Their mandate is to identify suitable business 
opportunities within our risk appetite and to adopt strategies and 
As a diversified financial services company active in a number of
businesses, managing risk is integral to our operations. A disciplined and 

integrated risk management approach is essential to building competitive

advantage and stability for our enterprise. It is intended to provide 

appropriate and independent risk oversigh
t across the enterprise. It also 
requires that the Risk Management Group works with our lines of business 

to create transparency and maintain open communication
.The impact of the economic downturn has lessened somewhat 
over the past year, although some sectors of the economy continue 

to experience the lingering effects of the recession. BMO has continued 
to exhibit the strong risk discipline that has served our customers 

and stakeholders well. While we and the financial services industry 
have learned lessons from the recent economic challenges, the prudent 

risk strategy that we built upon over the past several years has helped

practices that will optimize return on capital or achieve other business 
objectives. Each operating group must ensure that it is acting within its 

delegated risk-taking authority, as set out in our corporate risk policies 

and limits. Limits are set for the operating groups, each of which has 

effective processes and controls in place to enable it to operate within 

these limits.
Our second line of defence in the management of risk is provided 
by our Risk Management Group and other Corporate Support areas. 

These groups provide independent over
sight. It is the responsibility of 
the Risk Management Group to recommend and set corporate risk man-

agement policies and establish infrastructure, processes and practices 

that address all significant risks across the enterprise. Risk Management 

Group works on the assessment, quantification, monitoring and report-

ing of all significant risks to senior management and, as appropriate, 

the Board of Directors. 
Our third line of defence is our Corporate Audit Group. This group 
monitors the efficiency
 and effectiveness of controls across various 
functions within our operations, the re
liability of financial reporting, 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the implementation 
of significant initiatives.
Risk Governance
The foundation of our enterprise-wide risk management framework 

is a governance structure that includes a robust committee structure and 

a comprehensive set of corporate policies, which are approved by the 
Board of Directors or its committees, as well as supporting corporate 

standards and operating guidelines. This enterprise-wide risk manage-

ment framework is governed through a hierarchy of committees and 

individual responsibilities as outlined in the following diagram.
All elements of our risk management framework are reviewed on a 
regular basis by the Risk Review Committee of the Board of Directors to 
provide effective guidance for the governance of our risk-taking activities.
 In each of our operating groups, management monitors governance 
activities, controls and management processes and procedures and over-
sees their effective operation within our overall risk management 

framework. Individual governance committees establish and monitor 

further comprehensive risk management limits, consistent with and 

subordinate to the board-approved limits.
Limits and Authorities
BMO’s risk principles and risk appetite shape our risk limits, which are 

reviewed and approved annually by t
he Board of Directors and/or board 
and management committees:
• Credit and Counterparty Risk 
Œ limits on country, industry, portfolio/
product segments, group a
nd single-name exposures;
• Market Risk 
Œ limits on Market Value Exposure and stress exposures; and
• Liquidity and Funding Risk 
Œ limits on minimum levels of liquid assets 
and maximum levels of asset pledging, as well as guidelines approved 

by senior management for liability diversification and credit and 

liquidity requirements.

 77MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&ABoard of Directors
 is responsible for the stewardship of BMO 
and super
vising the management of BMO’s business and affairs. 
The board, either directly or through its committees, is responsible 
for oversight in the following areas: strategic planning, defining risk 

appetite, identification and management of risk, capital manage-

ment, promoting a culture of integrity, internal controls, succession 

planning and evaluation of senior management, communication, 

public disclosure and corporate governance.
Risk Review Committee of the Board of Directors (RRC)
 assists 
the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to 
BMO’s identification and management of risk, adherence to risk 
management corporate policies and procedures, and compliance 

with risk-related regulatory requirements.
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
 independently monitors and reports to the Board of Directors on the effectiveness 
of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, including 
internal controls over financial reporting.
President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
 is directly accountable 
to the board for all of BMO’s risk-taking activities. The CEO is sup-
ported by the Risk Manage 
ment Committee and its sub-committees, 
as well as Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management.

Risk Management Committee (RMC)
 is BMO’s senior risk 
committee. RMC reviews and discusses significant risk issues and 
action plans that arise in executing the enterprise-wide strategy. 
RMC provides risk oversight and governance at the highest levels 
The Board of Directors, based on recommendations from the Risk Review 

Committee and the Risk Management Committee, delegates the setting 

of credit and market risk limits to the President and CEO, who in turn 

delegates more specific authorities to
 the CRO and the operating group 

CROs. These delegated authorities allow the officers to set risk toler-

ances, approve geographic and industry sector exposure limits within 

defined parameters, and establish underwriting and inventory limits for 

trading and investment banking activities.
These delegated authorities are reviewed and approved annually by 
the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Risk Review Com-

mit 
tee. The criteria whereby these authorities may be further delegated 
throughout the organization, as well as the requirements 
relating to 
documentation, communication and monitoring of delegated authorities, 

are set out in corporate policies and standards.
Risk Culture
At BMO, risk culture is characterized as the actions and behaviours 
exhibited by our employees and groups as they identify, interpret
 and 
discuss risk and make choices in the face of both opportunity and risk. 

Our risk culture shapes the way we view and manage risks, and also the 

way we work with our colleagues to assess the ongoing align
ment of 
business strategies and activities within the limits of our 
risk appetite.
Our risk culture encourages an engagement between Risk Manage-
ment and our business groups that contributes to and enhances risk 

transparency. This promotes an understanding of the risks inherent in 

our businesses so that they can be managed appropriately. We encour-

age the open and timely sharing of information and ongoing discussions 

pertaining to risk to ensure that our understanding remains current. 

We also encourage the escalation of concerns regarding potential or 

emerging risks to senior management so that they can be evaluated and 

appropriate action taken. We actively incorporate risk appetite into our 

discussions, and work with the lines of business to consider appropriate 

risk-based measures when making business decisions. 
of management. This committee is chaired by the Chief Risk 

Officer (CRO).
RMC Sub-committees
 have oversight responsibility for the risk and 
balance sheet impacts of management strategies, governance, risk 
measurement and contingency planning. RMC and its sub-committees 
provide oversight over the processes whereby the risks incurred across 

the enterprise are identified, measured, monitored and reported in 

accordance with policy guidelines and are within delegated limits.
Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ER&PM)
 includes 
independent oversight of the credit and counterparty, operational and 

market risk functions. It promotes consistency of risk management 

practices and standards across the enterprise. ER&PM facilitates a dis-

ciplined approach to risk-taking through the execution of independent 

transactional concurrence and portfolio management, policy formula-
tion, risk reporting, stress testing, modelling, vetting and risk education 

responsibilities. This approach seeks
 to meet corporate objectives and 
to ensure that risks taken are consistent with BMO’s risk tolerance.
Operating Group CROs
 provide advice and independent risk oversight 

ac
ross all risk types, foster a high-performance risk culture at the 
operating group level and provide le
adership for the operating group 
risk organizations.
Operating Groups
 are responsible for managing risk within their 
respective areas. They exercise business judgment and seek to ensure 
that policies, processes and internal controls are in place and that 
significant risk issues are appropriately escalated to ER&PM.
To enhance our risk management capabilities and support the 
ongoing strengthening of our risk culture, we continue to add to the 

available learning opportunities and have expanded our delivery of risk

training across the enterprise. Our educational programs are designed

to foster a deeper understanding of BMO’s capital and risk management 

frameworks across the enterprise, providing our Risk Management 

employees and management with the tools and awareness required 

to undertake their accountabilities for independent oversight regardless 

of their position in the organization. This education strategy has 

been developed in partnership with our Institute for Learning, our 

Risk Management professionals, external risk experts and teaching 

professionals. Our credit training program, together with defined job 

descriptions, provides training and practice in sound risk management 

as a prerequisite to the granting of appropriate discretionary limits to 

qualified professionals.
Risk Principles
The risks we face are classified as credit and counterparty, market, 

liquidity and funding, operational, insurance, business, model, 

strategic, regulatory, reputation and environmental. Risk-taking and 

risk management activities across the enterprise are guided by the 

following principles:
• management of risk is a responsibility at all levels of the organization, 
employing the three-lines-of-defence approach;
• our risk appetite is approved by the Risk Review Committee, and is 
aligned with BMO’s strategic direction;
• ER&PM provides independent oversight of risk-taking activities across 
the organization;
• ER&PM monitors our risk management framework to ensure that our 
risk profile is maintained within our established risk appetite and 

supported with adequate capital;
• all material risks to which the enterprise is exposed are identified, 
measured, managed, monitored and reported;
78BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&A• decision-making is based on a clear understanding of risk, accompanied
 by robust metrics and analysis;
• business activities are developed, approved and conducted within 
established risk limits and should generate a level of return appropriate
 to their risk profile;
• Economic Capital is used to measure and aggregate risk across 
all risk types and business activities to facilitate the incorporation of 
risk into the measurement of business returns; and
• incentive compensation programs are designed and implemented to 
incorporate motivation that balances short-, medium- and long-term 

profit generation with the achievement of sustainable, non-volatile 

earnings growth, in line with our risk appetite.
Risk Appetite 
Our risk appetite identifies the amount and type of risk that we are 

willing to accept given our guiding principles and our capital capacity. 

Senior management recommends our Risk Appetite Statement for 

approval by the Risk Management Committee and the Risk Review 

Committee of the Board of Directors. Our Risk Appetite Statement is 

defined in both quantitative and qualitative terms and, among other 

things, requires:
• maintaining strong capital and liquidity and funding positions; 
• understanding the risks we face, and managing and monitoring them; 
• subjecting new product initiatives to a rigorous review and approval 
process to ensure risks are understood and can be managed;
• providing adequate resources for Risk Management, Finance and other 
Corporate Support functions;
• targeting a credit rating for BMO of AA– or better;
• identifying, evaluating and minimizing exposure to low-probability 
adverse tail event risks that could jeopardize the bank’s credit rating, 

capital position or reputation;
• maintaining a diversified and above-average quality lending portfolio 
relative to our peers;
• value at risk (VaR) that is not outsized relative to our peers;
• business practices and policies that ensure our reputation is safe-
guarded and protected at all times; and
• optimizing risk-return, to facilitate the efficient and effective deploy-
ment of capital. 
Risk Review and Approval
Risk review and approval processes are established based on the nature, 

size and complexity of the risks involved. Generally, the risk review and 

approval process is a formal review and approval of various categories by 

either an individual, group or sub-c
ommittee of the Risk Management 
Committee, independent of the o
riginator. Delegated authorities and 
approvals by category are outlined below.
Portfolio transactions 
Œ Transactions are approved through risk assess-
ment pr
ocesses for all types of transactions, including dual signatory 
authorities for credit risk and transactional and position limits for 

market risk.
Structured transactions 
Œ The Reputation Risk Management Committee 

and Tr
ading Products Risk Committee review new structured products 
and transactions with significant reputation, legal, accounting, regulatory 

or tax risk.
Investment initiatives 
Œ Documentation of risk assessments is 
formalized 
through our investment spending approval process, which 
is now reviewed 
and approved by Corporate Support areas.
New products and services 
Œ Policies and procedures for the approval
of
 new or modified products and services offered to our customers
are reviewed and approved by Corporate Support areas, as well as

the Operational Risk Committee, Trading Products Risk Committee and 

Reputation Risk Management Committee, as appropriate.
Risk Reporting
Enterprise-level risk transparency and associated reporting are critical 

components of our framework and operating culture that help all levels 

of business leaders, risk leaders, 
committees and the Board of Directors 
to effectively exercise their business management, risk management 

and oversight responsibilities. Internal reporting includes Enterprise Risk 

Chapters, which synthesize the key risks and associated metrics that 

the organization currently faces. The Chapters highlight our most signifi-

cant risks, as well as potential and emerging risks, to provide senior 

management and the Board of Directors with timely, actionable and 

forward-looking risk reporting on the significant risks our organization 

faces. This reporting includes material to facilitate assessments of these 

risks relative to our risk appetite and the relevant limits established 

within our framework. It also includes material on emerging risk.
On a regular basis, reporting on risk is also provided to stakeholders, 
including regulators, external rating 
agencies and our shareholders, as 

well as to others in the investment community.
Risk-Based Capital Assessment
Two measures of risk-based capital are used by BMO. These are Economic 

Capital and Regulatory Capital. Both are aggregate measures of risk that 

we undertake in pursuit of our financial targets. Our operating model 

provides for the direct management of each risk type but also provides 

for the management of risks on an integrated basis. Economic Capital is 

our integrated internal measure of
 the risk underly
ing our business 
activities. It represents management’s estimation of the magnitude of 

economic losses that could occur if adverse situations arise, and allows 

returns to be adjusted for risks. Economic Capital is calculated for various 

risk types 
Œ credit, market (trading and non-trading), operational and 
business 
Œ where measures are based on a time horizon of one year. 
An enterprise-wide framework of 
scenario selection, analysis and 
stress testing assists in determining the relative magnitude of risks 

taken and the distribution of those risks across the enterprise’s opera-

tions under different cond
itions. Stress testing and scenario analysis 
measure the impact on our operations and capital of stressed but 

plausible operational, economic, credit and market events. Scenarios 
are designed in collaboration with our economists, Risk Management 

groups, Finance and lines of business, based on historical or hypothetical 

events, a combination thereof, or significant economic developments. 

Economic variables derived from these scenarios are then applied to all 

significant and relevant risk-taking portfolios across the enterprise. 

As stipulated by the Basel II Accord, BMO also conducts stress testing of 

regulatory credit capital across all material portfolios using the Advanced 

Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) Approach calculation methodology.
We also conduct ongoing stress testing and scenario analysis 
designed to test BMO’s credit exposures to a specific industry, to several 

industries or to specific products that are highly correlated. These tests 

gauge the effect of various scenarios on default probabilities and loss 

rates in the portfolio under review. The results provide senior manage-

ment with insight into the sensitivi
ty of our exposures 
to the underlying 
risk characteristics of specific industries.
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 79MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&ACredit and counterparty risk exists in every lending activity that 
BMO enters into, as well as in the sale of treasury and other capital 

markets products, the holding of investment securities and securitization 

activities. BMO’s robust and effective credit risk management begins 
with our experienced and skilled professional lending and credit 

risk officers, who operate in a dual control structure to authorize lending
 transactions. These individuals are subject to a rigorous lender quali-
fication process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear 

delegation of decision-making authorit
y, including individually delegated 
lending limits. Credit decision-making is conducted at the management 

level appropriate to the size and risk of each transaction in accordance 

with comprehensive corporate policies, standards and procedures 

governing the conduct of credit risk activities.
Credit risk is assessed and measured using risk-based parameters:
Exposure at Default (EAD) 
represents an estimate of the outstanding 
amount of a credit exposure at the time a default may occur. For off-
balance sheet amounts and undrawn amounts, EAD includes an estimate 

of any further amounts that may be drawn at the time of default.
Loss Given Default (LGD) 
is the amount that may not be recovered 
in the event of a default, presented as a proportion of the exposure 
at default. LGD takes into consideration the amount and quality of any 

collateral held.
Probability of Default (PD) 
represents the likelihood that a credit 
obligation (loan) will not be repaid and will go into default. A PD 
is assigned to each account, based on the type of facility, the product 
type and customer characteristics. The credit history of the counterparty/ 

portfolio and the nature of the exposure are taken into account in the 

determination of a PD.
Expected Loss (EL) 
is a measure representing the loss that is expected 
to occur in the normal course of business in a given period of time. 
EL is calculated as a function of Exposure at Default, Loss Given Default 

and Probability of Default.
Unexpected Loss (UL) 
is a measure of the amount by which actual 
losses may exceed expected loss in the normal course of business in 
a given period of time.
Under Basel II, there are three approaches available for the computation 
of credit risk: Standardized, Foundation Internal Ratings Based and 

Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIR
B). We apply the AIRB Approach for 

calculations of credit risk in our po
rtfolios, while our subsidiary Harris 
Bancorp Inc. currently uses the Standardized Approach. Pending approval 

from OSFI, we plan to adopt the AIRB Approach for Harris Bancorp Inc. 

in 2011.
Risk Rating Systems 
BMO’s risk rating systems are designed to assess and measure the risk 

of any exposure. The rating systems 
differ for the consumer and small 
business portfolios and the commercial and corporate portfolios.
Consumer and Small Business 
The consumer and small business portfolios are made up of a 
diversified group of individual customer accounts and include residential 
mortgages, personal loans, and credit card and small business loans. 

These loans are managed in pools of homogeneous risk exposures. For 

these pools, credit risk models and decision support systems are devel-

oped using established statistical techniques and expert systems for 

underwriting and monitoring purposes. Adjudication models, behavioural 
scorecards, decision trees and expert knowledge are combined to 
produce optimal credit decisions in a centralized and automated environ-

ment. The characteristics of both the borrower and the loan, along with 

past portfolio experience, are used to predict the credit performance of 

new accounts. These metrics are used to define the overall credit risk 

profile of the portfolio, predict future performance of existing accounts 

for ongoing credit risk management and determine both Economic 

Capital and Basel II regulatory capital. Every exposure is assigned risk 

parameters, PD, LGD and EAD based on the performance of the pool, and 

these assignments are updated monthly. The PD risk profile of the AIRB 

Retail portfolio at October 31, 2010, was as follows:
PD risk profile 
PD range 
% of Retail EAD 
Exceptionally low 
.05% 
38.8Very low 
> 0.05% to 0.20% 
20.3Low  
> 0.20% to 0.75% 
23.7Medium 
> 0.75% to 7.00% 
15.6High  
> 7.00% to 99.99% 
1.3Default 100% 
0.3Commercial and Corporate Lending 

Within the commercial and corporate portfolios, we utilize an enterprise-

wide risk rating framework that is appl
ied to all of our sovereign, bank, 

corporate and commercial counterparties. This framework is consistent 
with the principles of Basel II, under which minimum regulatory 
capital requirements for credit risk are determined. One key element 

of this framework is the assignment of appropriate borrower risk ratings 

to help quantify potential credit risk. BMO’s risk rating framework 

establishes counterparty risk ratings using methodologies and rating 

criteria based on the specific risk characteristics of each counterparty. 

The resulting rating is then mapped to a probability of default over 

a one-year time horizon. As counterparties migrate between risk ratings, 

the probability of default associated with the counterparty changes. 
We review our loans and acceptances on an ongoing basis to assess 
whether any loans should be classified as impaired and whether an 

allowance or write-off should be recorded. Future losses are estimated 

based on the expected proportion of the exposure that will be at risk if 

a counterparty default occurs, through an analysis of transaction-specific 

factors such as the nature and term 
of the loan, collateral held and the 
seniority of our claim. For large corporate transactions, we also utilize 

unexpected loss models to assess the extent and correlation of risks 

before authorizing new exposures. 
Credit and Counterparty Risk
Credit and counterparty risk 
is the potential for loss due to the 
failure of a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty to repay 

a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation. 

This is the most significant measurable risk that BMO faces.

Policies and Standards 
BMO’s credit risk management framework is built on governing principles
 defined in a series of corporate policies and standards, which flow through
 to more specific guidelines and procedures. These 
are reviewed on a 
regular basis to ensure they are current and consistent
 with BMO’s risk 
appetite. The structure, limits, collateral requirements, ongoing manage-
ment, monitoring and reporting of our credit exposures are all governed 

by these credit risk management principles.
Credit Risk Governance 
The Risk Review Committee of the Board of Directors ultimately provides 

oversight for the management of all risks faced by the enterprise, 

including credit risk. Operating practices include the ongoing monitoring 

of credit risk exposures and regular portfolio and sector reporting to 

the board and senior management committees. Performing accounts 

are reviewed on a regular basis, with most commercial and corporate 

accounts reviewed at least annually. The credit review process provides 

an appropriate structure, including covenant monitoring, for each 

account. The frequency of review is increased in accordance with the 

likelihood and size of potential credit losses, with deteriorating higher-

risk situations referred to specialized account management groups 

for closer attention, when appropriate. Corporate Audit Group reviews 

and tests management processes and controls and samples credit trans-

actions for adherence to credit terms and conditions, as well as to 

governing policies, standards and procedures. In addition, we carry out 

regular portfolio sector reviews, including stress testing and scenario 

analysis based on current, emerging or prospective risks.
Portfolio Management 
BMO’s credit risk governance policies provide for an acceptable level 
of diversification. Limits are in place for several portfolio dimensions, 
including industry, country, product and single-name concentrations, 

as well as transaction-specific limits. At year end, our credit assets 

consisted of a well-diversified portfolio comprised of millions of clients, 

the majority of them consumers and small to medium-sized businesses.
BMO employs a number of measures to mitigate and manage credit
 risk. These measures include but are not limited to strong underwriting 

standards, qualified professional risk managers, a robust monitoring 

and review process, the redistribution of exposures, and the 
purchase 
or sale of insurance through guarantees or credit default swaps.
Total enterprise-wide outstanding credit exposures were 
$378 billion at October 31, 2010, comprised of $251 billion in Canada, 

$102 billion in the United States and $25 billion in other jurisdictions. 

Credit portfolio quality is discussed on page 40. Note 4 on page 120 of 

the financial statements and Tables 11 to 19 on pages 102 to 105 provide 
details of BMO’s loan portfolios, impaired loans and provisions and 
allowances for credit losses.
Collateral Management
The purpose of collateral for credit risk mitigation is to minimize losses 

that would otherwise be incurred and to protect funds employed in 
credit risk activities. Depending on the type of borrower, the assets avail-
able and the structure and term of the credit requirements, collateral 
can take various forms. Investment grade liquid securities are regularly 
pledged in support of treasury counterparty facilities. For corporate and 

commercial borrowers, collateral can take the form of pledges of the 
assets of a business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery 
and real estate, or personal assets pledged in support of guarantees. 
On an ongoing basis, collateral is subject to regular valuation as prescribed 
in the relevant governing policies and standards, which incorporate 

set formulas for certain asset types in the context of current economic 

and market circumstances.
Allowance for Credit Losses 
Across all loan portfolios, BMO employs a disciplined approach to 

provisioning and loan loss evaluation, with the prompt identification of 

problem loans being a key risk management objective. BMO maintains 

both specific and general allowances for credit losses, the sum of 

which is sufficient to reduce the book value of credit assets to their 

estimated value. Specific allowances reduce the aggregate carrying 

value of credit assets for which there is evidence of deterioration in 

credit quality. We also maintain a general allowance in order to cover 

any impairment in the existing portfolio that cannot yet be associated 

with specific loans. Our approach to establishing and maintaining the 

general allowance is based on the guideline issued by our regulator, 

OSFI. The general allowance is reviewed on a quarterly basis and a 

number of factors are considered when determining the appropriate 

level of the general allowance. This includes a general allowance model 

that applies historical expected and unexpected loss rates, based on 

probabilities of default and loss given default factors, to current

 81MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Aloans, loss rates are based on historical loss experience for the different 
portfolios. Model results are then considered, along with the level of the 

existing allowance and management’s judgment regarding portfolio 

quality, business mix, and economic and credit market conditions, to 

determine the appropriate adjustment to the allowance. 
BMO incurs market risk in its trading and underwriting activities and 

structural banking activities.
As part of our enterprise-wide risk management framework, we 
employ extensive governance and ma
nagement processes surrounding 

market risk-taking activities. These include: 
• oversight by senior governance 
committees, including the Trading 
Products Risk Committee, Balance Sheet Management Committee, 

Risk Management Committee and Risk Review Committee;
• an Economic Capital plan process that incorporates market risk measures
(market value exposures, stress testing); 
• a process for the effective valuation of trading positions and measure-
ment of market risk;
• development of appropriate policies and corporate standards;
• a well-developed limit-setting and monitoring process;
• controls over processes and models used; and
• a framework of scenario and stress tests for worst-case events.
High-level market risk measures for structural market risk include 

Earnings Volatility (EV) and Market Value Exposure (MVE). These 

positions are summarized in the table on page 85. The primary measure 

for market risk in trading and underwriting activities is MVE.
BMO’s Market Risk group provides independent oversight of trading and 
underwriting portfolios with the goal of ensuring: 
• market risk of trading and underwriting 
activities 
is measured and 
modelled in compliance with corporate policies and standards;
• risk profiles of our trading and underwriting activities 
are maintained 
within our risk appetite, and are monitored and reported 
to traders, 
management, senior executives and board committees;
• proactive identification and reporting to management, senior executives
 and board committees of specific exposures or other factors that 

expose BMO to unusual, unexpected, inappropriate or otherwise not 

fully identified or quantified risks associated with market or traded

Risk managed by Corporate Treasury.
Market risk 
is the potential for a negative impact on the balance 

sheet and/or income statement resulting from adverse changes in 

the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in certain 
market variables. These variables include interest rates, foreign 

exchange rates, equity and co
mmodity prices and their implied 
volatilities, as well as credit spreads, credit migration and default.
Trading and Underwriting Market Risk
To capture the multi-dimensional aspects of market risk effectively, 

a number of metrics are used, including VaR, stress testing, option 

sensitivities, position concentrations, market and notional values and 

revenue losses.
VaR and stress testing are portfolio estimates of risk but have 
limitations. Among the limitations of VaR are its assumption that all 

positions can be liquidated within the assigned one-day holding period 
(ten-day holding period for regulatory calculations), which may not 
be the case in illiquid market conditions, and that historical data can be 

used as a proxy to predict future market events. Scenario analysis and 

probabilistic stress testing are performed daily to determine the impact 

of unusual and/or unexpected market changes on our portfolios. As well, 

historical and event stresses are tested on a weekly basis. Scenarios 
are amended, added or deleted to better reflect changes in underlying 
market conditions. The results are reported to the lines of business, 
Trading Products Risk Committee, Risk Management Committee and Risk 
Review Committee on a regular basis. Stress testing is limited by the 
number of scenarios that can be run, a
nd by the fact that not all downside 
scenarios can be predicted and eff
ectively modelled. Neither VaR nor 
stress testing are viewed as predictors of the maximum amount of losses 
balances. For business loans, these historical loss rates are associated 

with the underlying risk rating of t
he borrower, which is assigned at the 
time of loan origination, monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted to 

reflect changes in underlying credit
 risk. These loss rates are further 
refined with regard to industry sectors and credit products. For consumer 
Earnings Volatility (EV) 
is a measure of the adverse impact 
of potential changes in market parameters on the projected 

12-month after-tax net income of a portfolio of assets, liabilities 

and off-balance sheet positions, measured at a 99% confidence 

level over a specified holding period.
Market Value Exposure (MVE) 
is a measure of the adverse 
impact of changes in market parameters on the market value 
of a portfolio of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, 

measured at a 99% confidence level over a specified holding 

period. The holding period considers current market conditions 

and composition of the portfolios to determine how long it 

would take to neutralize the market risk without adversely 

affecting market prices. For trading and underwriting activities, 

MVE is comprised of Value at Risk and Issuer Risk.
Value at Risk (VaR) 
is measured for specific classes of risk in 
BMO’s trading and underwriting activities: interest rate, foreign 
exchange rate, equity and comm
odity prices and their implied 

volatilities. This measure calculates the maximum likely loss 

from portfolios, measured at a 99% confidence level over a 

specified holding period.
Issuer Risk 
arises in BMO’s trading and underwriting portfolios, 
and measures the adverse impact of credit spread, credit migra-
tion and default risks on the market value of fixed-income 

instruments and similar securities. Issuer risk is measured at a 

99% confidence level over a specified holding period.

MD&Arules under GAAP and are accorded banking book regulatory capital 
treatment. For trading and underwriting portfolios covered by the 

internal models approach, VaR is co
mputed using BMO’s Trading Book 

Value at Risk model. This is a Mont
e Carlo scenario simulation model, 
and its output is used for market risk management and reporting 

of exposures. The model computes one-day VaR results using a 99% 

confidence level and reflects the correlations between the different 

classes of market risk factors. 
We use a variety of methods to verify the integrity of our risk 
models, including the application of 
backtesting against hypothetical 
losses. This process assumes there are no changes in the previous day’s 

closing positions. The process then isolates the effects of each day’s price 

movements against these closing positions. Models are validated by 

assessing how often the calculated hypothetical losses exceed the 

MVE measure over a defined period. Results of this testing confirm the 

reliability of our models. 
The correlations and volatility data that underpin our models are 
updated monthly, so that MVE measures are reflective of current volatility.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, changes were made to the calculation 
of MVE for AFS positions to better align the risk methodology to that 

used for the MTM positions within the Trading Book. This change, in 

addition to increased exposures in the quarter, resulted in an increase 

in interest rate risk for AFS securities. In 2011, a further methodology 

change is planned to include additional risk factors within the MVE 

calculation. It is expected that this will lead to a further increase in the 

calculated MVE. In general, the approach to the measurement of risk and 

governance of AFS positions in the trading businesses will continue to 

evolve in recognition of their distinct accounting treatment 
Œ i.e. the way 
changes in market value are recorded in the financial statements. 
Market risk exposures arising from trading and underwriting 
activities are summarized in the following table.

that could occur in any one day, because both measures are computed 
at prescribed confidence levels and could be exceeded in highly volatile 
market conditions. On a daily basis, exposures are aggregated by lines 
of business and risk type and monitored against delegated limit levels, and
 the results are reported to the appropriate stakeholders. The bank has a 
robust governance process in place for the adherence to delegated market 
risk limits. Amounts exceeding establ
ished limits are escalated to senior 
management on a timely basis for resolution and appropriate action. 
Within the Market Risk group, the Valuation Product Control group 
checks whether the valuations of all trading and underwriting portfolios 
within BMO are materially accurate by:
• developing and maintaining valuation adjustment/reserve policies 
and procedures in accordance with regulatory requirements and GAAP;
• establishing official rate sources for valuation of mark-to-market 
(MTM) portfolios; and
• providing an independent review of trading books where trader prices 
are used for valuation of mark-to-market portfolios. 
The Valuation Control processes include all over-the-counter (OTC) 
and exchange-traded instruments that are booked within Capital Markets
 Trading portfolios. These include both trading and available-for-sale 

(AFS) securities. Valuation Products Control group also performs an 

independent valuation of certain portfolios outside of Capital Markets 

Trading Products.
Trader valuations are reviewed to determine whether they align 
with an independent assessment of the market value of the portfolio. 
If the valuation differences exceed the prescribed tolerance threshold, 
a valuation adjustment is recorded in accordance with accounting 

policy and regulatory requirements. Prior to the final month-end general 

ledger close, meetings are held between staff from the line of business, 

Market Risk, Capital Markets Finance and Accounting Policy groups 

to review all valuation reserves and adjustments that are established 

by the Market Risk group.
The Valuation Steering Committee is the senior management level 
valuation committee within the bank. It meets at least quarterly to address 

the more challenging valuation issues in the bank’s portfolios and acts as 

a key forum for discussing Level 3 positions and their inherent uncertainty.
At a minimum, the following are considered when determining 
appropriate valuation adjustment levels: Credit Valuation Adjustments 

(CVA), close-out costs, uncertainty, administrative costs, liquidity and 

model risk. Also, a fair value hierarchy is used to categorize the inputs 

used in the valuation of securities, liabilities, derivative assets and deriv-

ative liabilities. Level 1 inputs cons
ist of quoted market prices, Level 2 
inputs consist of internal models that use observable market information 

and Level 3 inputs consist of internal models without observable market 

information. Details of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measure-

ments can be found in Note 29 on page 160 of the financial statements.
Our models are used to determine market risk Economic Capital 
for each of the lines of business and to determine regulatory capital. 

For capital calculation purposes,
 longer holding periods and/or higher 
confidence levels are used than are employed in day-to-day risk 

management. Prior to use, models are subject to review under the 

Model Risk Corporate Standard by our Model Risk and Vetting group. 

The Model Risk Corporate Standard outlines minimum requirements 

for the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of

MD&AThe distribution of our daily net revenue for the po
rtfolios has been affected by periodic valuation 
adjustments as outlined in the notes to the preceding Trading and Underwriting Net Revenues 
versus Market Value Exposure graph.
Structural Market Risk 
Structural market risk is comprised of interest rate risk arising from our 

banking activities (loans and deposits) and foreign exchange risk arising 

from our foreign currency operations. Structural market risk is managed 

by BMO’s Corporate Treasury group in support of high-quality earnings 

and maximization of sustainable product spreads.
Structural interest rate risk arises primarily from interest rate 
mismatches and embedded options. Interest rate mismatches result 

from differences in the scheduled maturity, repricing dates or reference 

rates of assets, liabilities and derivatives. Embedded option risk results 

from product features that allow customers to alter scheduled maturity or 

repricing dates. Embedded options in
clude loan prepayment and deposit 
redemption privileges and committed rates on unadvanced mortgages. The 

net interest rate mismatch, represen
ting residual assets funded by common 
shareholders’ equity, is managed to a 
target duration, which is currently 
between two and three years, while embedded options are managed to 

low risk levels. The net interest rate mismatch is primarily managed with 

interest rate swaps and securities. Embedded option risk exposures are 

managed by purchasing options or through a dynamic hedging process.
Structural foreign exchange risk arises primarily from translation 
risk associated with the net investment in our U.S. operations and from 

transaction risk associated with our U.S.-dollar-denominated net income.

84 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&ATranslation risk is managed by funding our net U.S. investment in U.S. 
dollars. Transaction risk is managed by assessing at the start of each 

quarter whether to enter into foreign exchange forward contract hedges 

that are expected to partially offset the pre-tax effects of Canadian/U.S. 
dollar exchange rate fluctuations in the quarter on the expected 
U.S. dollar net income for the quarter. The Canadian dollar equivalents 

of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated results are affected, favourably or 
unfavourably, by movements in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. 

The size of the impact on the Canadian dollar equivalents depends on 

the level of U.S.-dollar-denominated 
results and the movement in the 
exchange rate. If future results are consistent with the range of results 

for the past three years, each one cent decrease in the Canadian/U.S. 

dollar exchange rate, expressed in terms of how many Canadian dollars 

one U.S. dollar buys, would be expected to change the Canadian dollar 

equivalents of U.S.-dollar-denominated net income (loss) before income 

taxes by between –$6 million and $10 million. An increase of one cent 

would have the opposite effect. 
Structural MVE and EV measures both reflect holding periods of 
between one month and three months and incorporate the impact of 

correlation between market variables.
Structural MVE and EV are summarized in the following table. 
Structural MVE increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in 

common shareholders’ equity. Structural EV continues to be managed 

to low levels.

Models used to measure structural market risk project how interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates may change and predict how customers
 would likely react to the changes. For customer loans and deposits 

with scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as mortgages and 

term deposits), our models measure how customers are likely to use 

embedded options to alter those terms. For customer loans and deposits 

without scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as credit card 

loans and chequing accounts), our models assume a maturity profile 

that considers historical and forecasted trends in balances. These 

models have been developed using statistical analysis and are validated 

through regular model vetting and backtesting processes and ongoing 

dialogue with the lines of business. Models used to predict customer 

behaviour are also used in support of product pricing and performance 

measurement.
Liquidity and Funding Risk
credit and liquidity lines, purchase 
collateral for pledging and fund asset 

growth and strategic investments. Liquidity and funding requirements 

are assessed under expected and stressed economic, market, political 

and enterprise-specific environments, which determine the minimum 

required amount of liquid assets to be held at all times.
Our liquidity and funding risk management framework includes:
• oversight by senior governance committees, including the Balance 
Sheet Management Committee, Risk Management Committee and 

Risk Review Committee;
• an independent oversight group within Corporate Treasury;
• a Risk Review Committee-approved limit structure to support the 
maintenance of a strong liquidity position;
• effective processes and models to monitor and manage risk;
• strong controls over processes and models and their uses;
• a framework of scenario tests fo
r stressed operating conditions; and
• contingency plans to facilitate managing through disruption.
In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 

publ
ished for consultation an International framework for liquidity 
measurement, standards and monitoring. The framework contains two 

new liquidity measures, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable 

Funding Ratio (NSFR), and four monitoring tools (contractual maturity 
Managing liquidity and funding risk is essential to maintaining both 
depositor confidence and stability in earnings. It is BMO’s policy to ensure
 that sufficient liquid assets and funding capacity are available to meet 

financial commitments, even in times of stress.
We actively manage liquidity and funding risk across the enterprise 
by holding liquid assets in excess of established minimum requirements 

at all times. Liquid assets include unencumbered, high-quality assets 

that are marketable, can be pledged as security for borrowings, and 

can be converted to cash in a time frame that meets our liquidity 

and funding requirements. Liquid assets are held both in our trading 

businesses and in supplemental liquidity pools that are maintained for 
contingencies. Liquidity and funding requirements consist of expected 

and stressed cash outflows. These arise from obligations to repay deposits
 that are withdrawn or not renewed, fund drawdowns on available 
Liquidity and funding risk is the potential for loss if BMO is 
unable to meet financial commitments in a timely manner at 

reasonable prices as they fall due. Financial commitments 

include liabilities to depositors and suppliers, and lending,

quality liquid assets to stressed net cash outflows over a 30-day time 

period. The NSFR is the ratio of the available amount of stable funding 

(one-year or greater) to the req
uired amount of stable funding. 
The BCBS has stated that unlike the capital framework, for which 
extensive experience and data help inform the calibration, there is 

no similar track record for liquidity standards. For this reason the BCBS 

is proceeding carefully to refine the design and calibration in order 

to deliver a rigorous overall liquidity standard while avoiding unintended 

consequences to business models and funding structures. Additional 

guidance from the BCBS is expected before December 31, 2010. Based on 

the framework’s current design and calibration, the standards would 

result in higher costs for the banking industry, including BMO. An obser-

vation period for the LCR is scheduled to commence on January 1, 2011 
and adoption of a minimum standard is scheduled to commence on 

January 1, 2015. An observation period for the NSFR is scheduled to 

commence on January 1, 2012 and adoption of a minimum standard 
is scheduled to commence on January 1, 2018.
Fiscal 2010 began in an environment of improving global financial 
markets. Term wholesale funding volumes were increasing and credit 

spreads were decreasing. Governments and central banks were reducing 

the financial system support mechanisms they had introduced during 

the financial crisis. By mid-year, sovereign debt concerns developed in a 

number of European countries; however, these concerns were largely 

restricted to the European financial 
system. BMO’s liquidity and funding 
management framework was effective in ensuring we maintained a 

strong liquidity position throughout the year, and continues to help 

ensure that we maintain a strong position.
Data provided in this section reflect BMO’s consolidated position. 
BMO subsidiaries include regulated a
nd foreign entities, and therefore 
movements of funds between companies in the corporate group 

are subject to the liquidity, funding and capital adequacy considerations 

of the subsidiaries, as well as tax co
nsiderations. In recognition of these 
matters, BMO’s liquidity and funding positions are managed on both a 

consolidated and key legal entity basis. 
Three of the measures we use to evaluate liquidity and funding 
ris
k are the liquidity ratio, the level of core deposits, and the customer 
deposits and capital to loans ratio.
The liquidity ratio represents the sum of cash resources and secur-
ities as a percentage of total assets. BMO’s liquidity ratio was 35.0% at 

October 31, 2010, up from 31.9% in 2009. The liquidity ratio averaged 29.8% 

for the years 2006 to 2008. The ratio reflects a strong liquidity position.
Material in blue-tinted font above is an integral part of the 2010 annual consolidated financial statements (see page 75).
Cash and securities totalled $144.0 billion at the end of the year, 
compared with $124.1 billion in 2009. Liquidity provided by cash and 

securities is supplemented by secu
rities borrowed or purchased under 
resale agreements, which also can be readily converted into cash or 

cash substitutes to meet financial commitments. Securities borrowed or 

purchased under resale agreements tota
lled $28.1 billion at the end of 
the year, down from $36.0 billion in 2009.
In the ordinary course of business, a portion of cash, securities and 
securities borrowed or purchased 
under resale agreements is pledged 

as collateral to support trading activities and participation in clearing 

and payment systems, in Canada and abroad. At October 31, 2010, 

$49.9 billion of cash and securities and $19.6 billion of securities bor-

rowed or purchased under resale agreements had been pledged, 

compared with $39.3 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively, in 2009. 

These changes were driven by trading activities. Additional information 

on cash and securities can be found in Table 5 on page 97 and in 

Notes 2 and 3 beginning on page 116 of the financial statements. 
Core deposits are comprised of customer operating and savings 
account deposits and smaller fixed-date deposits (less than or equal 
to $100,000). Canadian dollar core deposits totalled $98.6 billion at the 

end of the year, up from $95.4 billion in 2009, and U.S. dollar and other 

currency core deposits totalled US$33.5 billion at the end of the year, 

up from US$27.7 billion in 2009.
 The increase in our U.S. dollar and other 
currency core deposits reflects investor preference for bank deposits, 
as well as growth through U.S. acquisitions. Larger fixed-date customer 

deposits totalled $20.1 billion at the end of the year, compared with 

$22.5 billion in 2009. Total deposits increased $13.1 billion during 2010 

to $249.3 billion at the end of the year. The increase in total deposits 

primarily reflects an increase in core deposits used to fund loan growth 

and an increase in non-core deposits to fund securities growth. 
Our large base of customer deposits, along with our strong capital 
base, reduces our requirements for wholesale funding. Customer 

deposits and capital equalled 104.1% of loans at the end of the year, 
down from 106.6% in the prior year.
Our funding philosophy requires that wholesale funding used to 
support loans is longer term (typically maturing in two to ten years) to 

better match the terms to maturity of our loans. Wholesale funding that 

supports liquid trading and underwriting assets and liquid available-

for-sale securities is generally shorter term (maturing in less than two 

years). Diversification of our wholesale funding sources is an important 

part of our overall liquidity management strategy. In accordance with 

internal guidelines, our wholesale 
funding is diversified by customer, 
type, market, maturity term, currency and geographic region.
 BMO 
has t
he ability to raise long-t
erm funding through various platforms, 
including a European Note Issuance Program, Canadian and U.S. 

Medium-Term Note Programs, a Global Covered Bond Program, Canadian 

and U.S. mortgage securitizations, Canadian credit card securitizations, 

and Canadian and U.S. senior (unsecured) deposits. Information on 

deposit maturities can be found in Table 20 on page 106.
The credit ratings assigned to BMO’s senior debt securities by 
external rating agencies are important in the raising of both capital and 

funding to support our business operations. Maintaining strong credit 

ratings allows us to access the capital markets at competitive pricing 

levels. BMO’s ratings are indicative of high-grade, high-quality issues. 

They are: DBRS (AA); Fitch Ratings (AA–); Moody’s Investors Service 

(Aa2); and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (A+). 
DBRS, Fitch, Moody’s 
and S&P have a stable outlook for BMO. Should 
our credit ratings 
materially decrease, our cost of funds would likely increase significantly 

and our access to funding and capital through capital markets could

Operational Risk
As a large and diversified financial services company, BMO is exposed to 
potential loss arising from a variety of operational risks, including process 
failure, theft and fraud, regulatory non-compliance, business disruption, 
information security breaches and exposure related to outsourcing, as 

well as damage to physical assets. Operational risk is inherent in all our 

business activities, including the processes and controls used to manage 

credit risk, market risk and all other risks we face. While operational risk 

can never be fully eliminated, it can be managed to reduce exposure 

to financial loss, reputational harm or regulatory sanction.
The three-lines-of-defence operating model establishes appropriate 
accountability for operational risk management. The operating groups 

are responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk 

in a manner consistent with enterprise-wide principles. Independent 

risk management oversight is provided by Operating Group CROs, 

Group Operational Risk Officers, Corporate Support areas and Enterprise 

Operational Risk Manage 
ment. Operating Group CROs and Operational 
Risk Officers independently assess group operational risk profiles, 
identifying material exposures and potential weaknesses in controls and 

recommending appropriate mitigation strategies and actions. Corporate 

Support areas, including key areas such as Finance, Business Continuity, 

Legal and Compliance, Human Resources and Technology, develop the 

tools and processes to independently manage specialized operational 

risks across the organization. Enterprise Operational Risk Management 

establishes the Operational Risk Management Framework and Strategy 

as well as the necessary governance framework.
Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF)
The ORMF defines the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, 

moni
tor and report key operational risk exposures. A primary objective 
of the ORMF is to ensure that our operational risk profile is consistent 
with our risk appetite and supported with adequate capital. The key 
programs, methodologies and processes developed to support the 

framework are highlighted below. Enhancements to the ORMF are 
ongoing, giving due consideration to emerging industry and regulatory 

guidance as detailed in the Basel II Capital Accord.
Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
RCSA is an established process used by our operating groups to identify 

the key r
isks associated with their business strategies and the controls 
required for risk mitigation. The RCSA process provides a forward-looking 

view of the impact of the business environment and internal controls 

on operating group risk profiles. On an aggregate basis, RCSA results 

provide a consolidated view of operational risks relative to risk appetite.
Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
Operating groups and Corporate Support areas are required to identify KRIs 
related to their material risks. KRIs are used to monitor operational risk 

profiles and are linked to thresholds that trigger management action. KRIs 

provide an early warning indicator of adverse changes in risk exposure.
Operational risk
 is the potential for loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human 
interactions or external events, but excludes business risk.
Event Data Collection and Analysis

Internal loss data has been collected throughout the enterprise since 

20
04 and serves as an important means of measuring our operational 
risk exposure and identifying risk mitigation opportunities. Loss data 

is analyzed and benchmarked against external data and material trends 

are reported to senior management and our Board of Directors on a 

regular basis. BMO is a member of the Operational Risk Data Exchange, 

an international association of banks that share loss data information 

anonymously to assist in risk identification, assessment and modelling.
Capital Quantification
BMO uses The Standardized Approach (TSA) to determine Basel II 
regulatory capital requirements for operational risk. TSA processes and 
capital measures have been implemented at both the consolidated enter-

prise and applicable legal entity lev
els. The implementation of the Basel II 
Advanced Measure 
ment Approach is a priority for the enterprise and 
will enable the quantification of operational risk capital using internal 

models and loss-based methodologies.
Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing
Stress testing measures the potential impact of plausible operational, 

eco
nomic, market and credit events on our operations and capital. 
Scenario analysis provides management with a better understanding of 

low-frequency, high-severity events and provides a gauge of enterprise 

preparedness for events that could create risks that exceed our risk 

appetite. Scenario analysis is an input in the calculation of operational 

risk capital under the Advanced Measurement Approach.
Reporting
Regular reporting of our enterprise operational risk profile to senior 
management and the board is an important element of our Operational 
Risk Management Framework. Operational risk reporting supports risk 

transparency and the proactive management of material operational 

risk exposures.
Governance
Operational risk management is governed by a robust committee 

st
ructure as well as a comprehensive set of policies, standards and 
operating guidelines. Operational Risk Committee (ORC), a sub-committee 
of the Risk Manage 
ment Committee, is the main decision-making 
committee for all operational risk management matters and has 
oversight responsibility for operational risk strategy, management and 

governance. ORC provides advice and guidance to the lines of business 

on operational risk assessments, measurement and mitigation, and 

related monitoring and change initiatives. ORC oversees the develop-

ment of policies, standards and operating guidelines that give effect to 

the governing principles of the ORMF. These governance documents 

incorporate industry best practices and are reviewed on a regular 

basis to ensure they are current and consistent with our risk appetite.
Corporate Insurance Program
BMO’s corporate insurance program provides secondary mitigation of 

certain operational risk exposures. 
We purchase insurance in amounts 
that provide protection against unexpected material loss and when 

insurance is required by law, regulation or contractual agreement.

87MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AModel RiskBMO uses models that range from the very simple to those that value 
complex transactions or involve sophisticated portfolio and capital 

management methodologies. These models are used to guide strategic 
Model risk is the potential loss due to the risk of a model not 

performing or capturing risk as designed. It also arises from 

the possibility of the use of an inappropriate model or the 

inappropriate use of a model.
decisions and to assist in making daily lending, trading, underwriting, 

funding, investment and operational decisions. Models have also been 

developed to measure exposure to specific risks and to measure total risk 

on an integrated basis, using Economic Capital. We have strong controls 

over the development, implementation and application of these models.
BMO uses a variety of models, which can be grouped within
six categories:
• valuation models for the valuation of assets, liabilities or reserves;
• risk exposure models measuring credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and
 operational risk, which also addre
ss expected loss and its applications;
Business Risk
Business risk
 arises from the specific business activities of 
a company and the effects these could have on its earnings.
Business risk encompasses the potential causes of earnings volatility 
that are distinct from credit, market or operational risk factors. 

It identifies
 factors related to the risk that volumes will decrease 
or margins will shrink without the ability to compensate for this 

decline by cost cutting.
BMO faces many risks that are similar to those faced by non-
financial firms, principally that our profitability, and hence value, may

be eroded by changes in the business environment or by failures of 

strategy or execution. Sources of these risks include, but are not limited 

to, changing client expectations, adverse business developments and 

relatively ineffective responses to industry changes.
Within BMO, each operating group is responsible for controlling 
its respective business risk by assessing, managing and mitigating 

the risks arising from changes in business volume and cost structure, 

among other factors.
Insurance Risk
Insurance risk consists of:
• Claims risk 
Œ The risk that the actual magnitude or frequency of 
claims will differ from the levels assumed in the pricing or underwriting 
process. Claims risk includes mortality risk, morbidity risk and natural 

catastrophe risk.
• Policyholder behaviour risk 
Œ The risk that the behaviour of policy-
holders relating to premium payments, withdrawals or loans, policy 

lapses and surrenders and other voluntary terminations will differ 

from the behaviour assumed in the pricing calculations. 
• Expense risk 
Œ The risk that actual expenses associated with acquiring 
and administering policies and claims processing will exceed the 

expected expenses assumed in pricing calculations. 
Insurance risk approval authority is delegated by BMO’s Board of Directors
 to senior management. A robust product approval process is a corner-

stone for identifying, assessing and mitigating risks associated with 

new insurance products or changes to existing products. This process, 

combined with guidelines and practices for underwriting and claims 

management, promotes the effective identification, measurement and 

management of insurance risk. Reinsurance, which involves transactions 
that transfer insurance risk to independent reinsurance companies, 

is also used to manage our exposure 
to insurance risk by diversifying 
risk and limiting claims.
Insurance risk is monitored on a regular basis. Actuarial liabilities 
are estimates of the amounts requir
ed to meet insurance obligations. 
Insurance risk
 is the risk of loss due to actual experience being 
different than that assumed when an insurance product was 

designed and priced. Insurance risk 
exists in all our insurance 
businesses, including annuities and life, accident and sickness, 

and creditor insurance, as we
ll as our reinsurance business.
Liabilities are established in accordance with the standards of practice 

of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries and the CICA. The liabilities are 

validated through extensive internal and external reviews and audits. 

Assumptions underlying actuarial liabilities are regularly updated to 

reflect emerging actual experience. The Appointed Actuary of our 

Canadian insurance subsidiaries is appointed by the boards of directors 

and has statutory responsibility for providing opinions on the adequacy 

of provisions for the policyholder liabil
ities, the solvency of the insurance 
company and fairness of treatment of participating policyholders. In 

addition, the work of the Appointed Actuary is subject to an external, 

independent review by a qualified actuary every three years in accor-

dance with OSFI Guideline E-15.
The Board of Directors establishes approval authorities and 
limits and delegates these to the 
management teams of the insurance 

subsidiaries. The boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries are 

responsible for the stewardship of their respective insurance companies. 

Through oversight and monitoring, the boards are responsible for 

determining that the insurance su
bsidiaries are managed and function 
in accordance with established insurance strategies and policies. 

ER&PM is responsible for providing risk management direction and 

independent oversight to the insuranc
e businesses. This group also has 
the approval authority for activities that exceed delegated authorities 

and limits of the boards of the insurance companies, or that expose 

BMO to significant risk. 
Our insurance subsidiaries prov
ide independent evaluation and 
reporting on insurance risk exposures to their boards of directors and at 

the enterprise level, including reporting to both Private Client Group 

management and the Risk Review Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Reporting includes an assessment of all risks facing the insurance 
subsidiaries, including top-line and emerging risks.
88 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
MD&AStrategic risk arises from: external risks inherent in the business 
environment within which BMO operates and the risk of potential loss 

if BMO is unable to deal with those external risks effectively. While 

external strategic risks 
Œ including economic, political, regulatory, 
technological, social and competitive risks 
Œ cannot be controlled, 
the likelihood and magnitude of their impact can be mitigated through 

an effective strategic risk management process.
BMO’s Office of Strategic Management (OSM) oversees the 
governance and management processes for identifying, monitoring 

and mitigating strategic risks across the enterprise. A rigorous strategic 

management process incorporates a consistent approach to the

devel 
opment of strategies and incorporates accurate and comprehensive 
financial information linked to financial commitments.
The OSM works with the lines of business and key corporate stake-
holders during the strategy development process to promote consistency 

and adherence to strategic management standards. Included in this 

process is a review of the changing business environment within 

which each of our lines of business operates, including broad industry 

trends and the actions of our competitors. Strategies are reviewed 

with the Management Committee a
nd the Board of Directors annually 
in interactive sessions designed to challenge assumptions and strategies 

in light of current and potential future environments.
Performance commitments established through the strategic 
management process are regularly monitored and are reported upon 

quarterly, using both leading and lagging indicators of performance, 
so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted when necessary. 

Regular strategic and financial updates are also monitored closely 

to identify any significant issues.
Strategic Risk
• capital and stress testing models for measuring capital, allocating 

capital and managing
 Regulatory Capital and Economic Capital;
• fiduciary models for asset allocation, asset optimization and portfolio 
management;
• major business strategy models to forecast the possible outcomes 
of new strategies in support of our business decision process; and
• models driven by regulatory and other stakeholder requirements.
Prior to use, models are subject to review under the Model Risk 

Corporate Standard by our Model Risk and Vetting group. The Model Risk 
Corporate Standard outlines minimum requirements for the identification, 
assessment, monitoring and management of models and model risk 

throughout the enterprise. All models are rated according to their risk 

levels, which determine the frequency of ongoing review. In addition to 
regularly scheduled model validation and vetting, model risk monitoring 

and oversight activities are in place so that models are managed, 

used and perform as expected, thereby increasing the likelihood of 

early detection of emerging issues.
During the current year, BMO’s enterprise-wide Model Risk 
Management Framework was enhanced with additional emphasis on 

end-to-end stakeholder governance, including the establishment of 

a Model Risk Management Forum, a cross-functional group in which all 
stakeholders (model users, model owners and the Model Risk and Vetting 
Group) provide their input into the development, implementation and 

maintenance of the model risk framework and processes covering all 

models that are in use across the enterprise.
The operating groups are responsible for the day to day management 

of their regulatory risk in a manner consistent with enterprise-wide 

policies. Legal, Corporate and Compliance Group (LCCG) provides 

independent risk management oversight through Deputy General 

Counsel and Chief Compliance Officers with designated operating group 

responsibility. These legal and compliance officers independently assess 

risk profiles, assist in identifying material control weaknesses and 

recommend mitigation strategies and actions. LCCG establishes the 

legal and compliance enterprise risk management framework, as well 

as the necessary governance framework.
Regulatory risk 
is the risk of not complying with regulatory 
requirements, regulatory changes or regulators’ expectations. 

Failing to properly manage regulatory risk may result in regulatory 

sanctions being imposed, and could harm our reputation. 
Regulation of the financial sector has received heightened attention 
during the past year, as new rules were proposed and enacted to reform 

regulatory and capital requirements. Significant developments included 

the enactment of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act
 (Dodd-Frank Act) in the United States and adoption of 

the International Regulatory Framework for Banks (Basel III). The Dodd-

Frank Act is broad in scope and requires development of many new 

rules and regulations. It will be phased in over a period of several years. 

We continue to assess the impact these developments will have on 

our operations. 
During the past year we have undertaken a great deal of work in 
regards to Basel III. While there are uncertainties surrounding the Basel 

proposals, which will be addressed in the upcoming years, given the 

strength of our capital and liquidity positions, we believe that we are 

well positioned to adopt the known regulatory changes.
Further information on our approach to the adoption of Basel III 
can be found in the Capital Management section on page 59, and the 

Liquidity and Funding section on page 85.

89MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&AEnvironmental Risk
Environmental risk is addressed in our board-approved sustainability 
corporate policy. Environmental risk management activities are overseen 

by both the Corporate Sustainability and Environmental Sustainability 

groups, with support from our lines of business and other Corporate 

Support areas. Executive oversight of
 our environmental activities is 
provided by BMO’s Sustainability Council, comprised of executives 

representing the various areas of the organization. Senior management 

committees are provided with reports on the progress of activities 

mandated by our environmental strategy, as appropriate. Our environ-

mental policies and practices are outlined in detail in our annual 

Corporate Responsibility Report and Public Accountability Statement 

and on our Corporate Responsibility website.
Environmental risk covers a broad spectrum of issues, such as 
climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem health, unsustainable 

resource use, pollution, waste and water. We work with external 

stakeholders to understand the imp

context of these issues, and we use this understanding to determine 

the consequences for our businesses.
In addition, specific line of business guidelines outline 
how environmental risks inherent in lending activities are managed. 

Environmental risks associated with lending transactions are 

managed within BMO’s credit and counterparty risk framework. Specific 

guidelines related to climate ch
ange are applied to transactions with 
clients operating in emissions-intensive industry sectors, and we adhere 

to the standards set out in the Equator Principles, a framework for 

evaluating social and environmental risk in project finance transactions 

based on the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation 

Performance Standards.
In 2010, we achieved carbon neutrality relative to energy con-
sumption and transportation emissions across the company worldwide. 

This was done by engaging in consumption reduction measures, 

purchasing renewable energy for our operations in Canada and the 

United States and purchasing high-quality carbon offsets to neutralize 

the remaining emissions. BMO committed $10 million over five years to 

the Greening Canada Fund, the first voluntary carbon emissions reduction

fund open only to Canadian corporations. The fund provides direct access 

to greenhouse gas emission offset credits and helps BMO invest in 

Canadian-based emission reduction projects. 
Caution 
This Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section contains forward-looking statements. 

Please see the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
Reputation Risk
BMO’s reputation is one of its most valuable assets. By protecting and 

maintaining this reputation, we can increase shareholder value, reduce 

the costs of capital and improve employee engagement.
Fostering a business culture in which integrity and ethical 
conduct are core values is key to effectively protecting and maintaining 

BMO’s reputation.
Reputation risk 
is the risk of a negative impact to BMO that 

results from the deterioration of BMO’s reputation among stake-

holders. These potential impacts include revenue loss, reduced 

client loyalty, litigation, regulatory sanction or additional 

oversight, and declines in BMO’s share price.
We believe that active, ongoing and effective management 
of reputation risk is best achieved by considering reputation risk issues 

in strategy development, strategic and operational implementation 

and transactional or initiative decision-making. Reputation risk is also 

managed through our corporate governance practices, code of conduct 

and risk management framework.
All employees are responsible for conducting themselves in 
accordance with 
FirstPrinciples, BMO’s code of conduct, thus building 
and maintaining BMO’s reputation. The Reputation Risk Management 

Committee considers significant potential reputation risks to the 

enterprise, including the review of complex credit and structured-

finance transactions as required.

  The table above outlines non-GAAP measures used by BMO together with their closest 
GAAP counterparts.
Non-GAAP Measures
BMO uses both GAAP and certain non-GAAP measures to assess perfor-

mance. Securities regulators require that companies caution readers 

that earnings and other measures adjusted to a basis other than GAAP 

do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and are unlikely to be 

comparable to similar measures used by other companies. The adjacent 

table reconciles these non-GAAP measures, which management regu-

larly monitors, to their GAAP counterparts.
At times, we indicate measures excluding the effects of certain 
items but we generally do so in conjunction with disclosure of the 

nearest GAAP measure and details of the reconciling item. Amounts and 

measures stated on such a basis are considered useful as they could be 

expected to be reflective of ongoing operating results or assist readers’ 

understanding of performance. To assist readers, we have also provided 

a schedule that summarizes notable items that have affected results in 

the reporting periods. 
Cash earnings, cash productivity and cash operating leverage 
measures may enhance comparisons between periods when there has 

been an acquisition, particularly because the purchase decision may 

not consider the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets to 

be a relevant expense. Cash EPS measures are also disclosed because 

analysts often focus on this measure, and cash EPS is used by Thomson 

First Call to track third-party earnings estimates that are frequently 

reported in the media. Cash measures add the after-tax amortization 

of acquisition-related intangible assets to GAAP earnings to derive cash 

net income (and associated cash EPS), and deduct the amortization of 

acquisition-related intangible assets from non-interest expense to derive 

cash productivity and cash operating leverage measures.
Net economic profit represents cash net income available to 
common shareholders, less a charge for capital, and is considered an 

effective measure of added economic value.
Income before provision for credit losses, income taxes and 
non-controlling interest in subsidiaries is considered a useful measure 

as it provides a measure of performance that excludes the effects 

of credit losses and income taxes, which can at times mask performance 

because of their size and variability.
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 91MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&A2009 Financial Performance Review
The preceding discussions in the MD&A focused on our performance in 
2010. This section summarizes our performance in fiscal 2009 relative 

to fiscal 2008. As noted on page 26, certain prior year data has been 

restated to conform to the presentation in 2010, including restatements 

arising from transfers between operating groups. Further detail is pro-

vided on page 43.
Net income decreased $191 million or 10% to $1,787 million in 
fiscal 2009 and earnings per share fell $0.68 or 18% to $3.08. Results 

for the year were affected by charges related to notable items totalling 

$474 million after tax ($0.88 per share). Results in 2008 were affected 

by charges related to notable items totalling $426 million after tax 

($0.84 per share). Amounts are detailed in the Notable Items section on 

page 36. We also recorded elevated provisions for credit losses in 2009 
and higher income taxes. Return on equity was 9.9%, down from 13.0% 
in 2008, primarily due to increases in the number of common and 

preferred shares, as well as lower net income.
Revenue rose $859 million or 8.4% in 2009 to $11,064 million. 
Revenue in 2009 was reduced by charges of $521 million associated with 

notable items related to the impact of the weak capital markets environ-

ment. In 2008, revenue was reduced by $388 million of such charges. 

The higher charges in 2009 dampened revenue growth by $133 million. 

The stronger U.S. dollar increased overall revenue growth by $363 million 

or 3.5 percentage points, while the net impact of acquired businesses 

increased revenue growth by $172 million or 1.7 percentage points. 

The remaining increase was primarily attributable to business growth, 
as there was solid revenue growth in P&C Canada, P&C U.S. and 
BMO Capital Markets.
Credit conditions remained difficult in 2009, with indications of 
stabilization appearing in the latter half of the year. BMO recorded a 

$1,603 million provision for credit losses, consisting of $1,543 million 

of specific provisions and a $60 million increase in the general allowance 

for credit losses. These amounts compare to a $1,330 million provision 

recorded in 2008, comprised of specific provisions of $1,070 million and 

a $260 million increase in the general allowance.
Non-interest expense increased $487 million or 7.1% to $7,381 mil-
lion. The net effect of businesses acquired in 2009 and 2008 increased 

expenses in 2009 relative to 2008 by $124 million (1.8%). The stronger 
U.S. dollar increased costs in 2009 by $216 million (3.1%). Other employee
 compensation expense, which includes salaries and employee benefits, 

was $368 million or 14% higher than in 2008. Approximately one third 

of this increase was due to $118 million of severance costs, one third to 

higher benefit costs and the remainder to business acquisitions in P&C 

U.S. and Private Client Group, as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. Benefit 
costs were increased by higher pension costs. Employ ment levels were 

reduced in 2009 by 900 full-time equivalent employees or 2.4% to 

36,173 full-time equivalent employees at October 31, 2009 as a result 
of expense management efforts.
The provision for income taxes was $217 million in 2009, compared 
with a $71 million recovery of income taxes in 2008. The effective tax 

rate in 2009 was a tax expense rate of 10.5%, compared with a recovery 

rate of 3.6% in 2008. Results included a recovery of prior years’ income 

taxes of $160 million in 2008. The higher effective tax rate in 2009 was 

mainly attributable to a lower recovery of prior years’ income taxes 

and a lower proportion of income from lower-tax-rate jurisdictions. 
Net income in P&C Canada rose $262 million or 23% from 2008 to 
$1,415 million. Revenue increased $493 million or 10% to $5,287 million. 
Results largely reflected higher volumes in most products and improve-

ments in net interest margin. There was very strong revenue growth 

across personal banking, commercial banking and cards and payment 
services. Non-interest expense increased $104 million or 3.8% to 
$2,837 million due to increases in employee benefits costs, performance-

based compensation and occupancy and payment services costs, 

partially offset by lower business initiative spending and cost savings 

resulting from reduced employment levels.
Net income in P&C U.S. increased $44 million to $286 million in 
2009. On a U.S. dollar basis, net income increased $7 million or 3.0%. 

Revenue increased $226 million to $1,568 million, but increased $41 mil-

lion or 3.2% on a U.S. dollar basis. The increase was largely driven by 

our Wisconsin acquisitions, strong deposit volume growth and gains 

on 
the sale of mortgages. This was partially offset by the impact of 
increases in impaired loans and the benefit in 2008 of the sale of 

a portion of our investment in Visa. Non-interest expense increased 

$127 million or 14% to $1,042 million, but increased only $12 million 

or 1.4% on a U.S. dollar basis. 
Net income in Private Client Group was $359 million, down 
$67 million from 2008, reflecting weak equity markets and a low 
interest rate environment. Results in 2009 were reduced by $17 million 

($11 million after tax) of charges associated with actions taken to 

support U.S. clients in the difficult capital markets environment, but also 

reflected a $23 million recovery of prior years’ income taxes. Results in 

2008 were affected by a $31 million ($19 million after tax) charge for 

similar actions to support clients. Revenue of $2,012 million decreased 

$134 million, primarily due to lower revenues in our brokerage and 

mutual fund businesses. Insurance r
evenues increased as a result of the 
acquisition of BMO Life Assurance. Non-interest expense was unchanged 

at $1,569 million. 
Net income in BMO Capital Markets increased $305 million to 
$873 million. Results in 2009 were affected by charges of $521 million 

($355 million after tax) related to the deterioration in capital markets. 

Results in 2008 were affected by $388 million ($260 million after tax) of 

such charges. Additionally, 2008 net income included a $115 million 

recovery of prior periods’ income taxes. Revenue increased $911 million 

or 42% to $3,089 million. Revenue growth was largely driven by signifi-

cantly higher trading revenues as well as corporate banking revenues. 

Revenues from our interest-rate-sensitive businesses also increased due 

to favourable market spreads and equity underwriting fees increased 

as well, driven by corporate clients choosing to strengthen their capital 

positions. Non-interest expense increased $108 million or 6.6% to 

$1,744 million, primarily due to increased employee costs, in line with 

improved business performance, and higher allocated costs. 
Corporate Services net loss for the year was $1,146 million, 
compared with a net loss of $411 million in 2008. The increased loss 
in part reflected lower revenues, higher provisions for credit losses and 

increased expenses. The reduction in revenues was primarily driven by a 

negative carry on certain asset-liability interest rate positions as a result 

of changes in interest rates, the impact of funding activities undertaken 

to enhance our strong liquidity position, the mark-to-market impact of 

hedging activities and the effect on results in 2009 of credit card securi-

tizations completed in 2008. Non-interest expense was $148 million 

higher, largely related to a $118 million ($80 million after tax) severance 

charge and higher deposit insurance premiums.

MD&AReview of Fourth Quarter Performance
Results in the fourth quarter of 2010 were very good, with solid 
revenue growth, reflecting the consistent execution of BMO’s strategy of 
providing an industry-leading customer experience and the benefits of 

our diversified business mix. P&C Canada had another strong quarter, 

driven by volume growth across most lines of business and improved net 

interest margins. P&C U.S. saw the benefit of loan spread improvement, 

new account openings and growing deposit balances but results were 

affected by higher credit losses, the impact of impaired loans and acqui-

sition integration costs. Private Client Group produced strong results with 

net income substantially higher than in the same quarter a year ago, 

with strong revenue growth. Results for BMO Capital Markets reflected 

revenue growth, from the strong levels of a year ago, but net income 

decreased due to higher credit losses and increased expenses, as a result 

of investing to grow the business.
BMO’s net income was $739 million, up $92 million or 14% from 
a year ago. Summary income statements and data for the quarter and 
comparative quarters are outlined on page 95. Increased revenues 
and lower provisions for credit losses were partially offset by the impact 

of increased expenses. Results in the fourth quarter of 2009 included 
a $50 million pre-tax charge related to our Canadian Credit Protection 
Vehicle, which was considered a notable item in the 2009 fiscal year. 

There were no notable items in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Personal and Commercial Banking net income increased $9 million 
or 2.1% from a year ago to $458 million. P&C Canada net income increased 
$22 million or 5.5% to $420 million. Revenue increased $138 million 

or 10%, driven by volume growth across most products, the inclusion of 

Diners Club business revenues in financial results and an improved net 

interest margin. Provisions for credit losses increased $30 million due to 

growth in the portfolio and the add
ition of the Diners Club business. 
Non-interest expense increased $80 million or 11% due to higher initia-

tives expense, higher salaries and benefits from increased staff levels 
and the inclusion of the Diners Club business in results, as well as low 
capital tax expense in the prior year. 
P&C U.S. net income of US$37 million was down US$11 million 
or 21% from US$48 million a year ago, but was essentially unchanged
 after adjusting results in both years for acquisition integration costs. 
The benefits of loan spread improvement and deposit balance growth 
were largely offset by an increase in the impact of impaired loans, 
higher provisions for credit losses, a decrease in loan balances and deposit
 spread compression. On a basis that adjusts for the impact of impaired 

loans, a reduction in our Visa litigation accrual and acquisition integration 
costs, net income was US$59 million, an increase of US$1 million 
or 2.1% from results of a year ago on a comparably-adjusted basis. 

Revenue increased US$42 million or 13% due to the Rockford, Illinois-

based bank transaction and improved loan spreads. Non-interest 

expense increased due to the Rockford transaction including higher 
acquisition integration costs. 
Private Client Group net income was $131 million, up a strong 
$25 million or 25% from last year. Revenue increased $48 million or 8.6%
 with strong growth across most businesses. PCG, excluding insurance, 
achieved strong revenue growth, driven by an 11% improvement in client
 assets under management and administration. Revenue from the 
insurance business was unchanged year over year, as the benefit from 
higher premium revenue was offset by effects of the unfavourable 
market movements on policy liabilities. 
BMO Capital Markets net income of $216 million decreased 
$44 million or 17% from the very strong results of a year ago. Revenue 
increased but there were higher provisions for credit losses and 
expenses also increased, in part due to higher employee costs as we 
continued to invest in strategic hiring across the business. Revenue for 
the quarter increased $20 million from a year ago to $834 million, driven 

by gains in investment securities and higher mergers and acquisitions 
revenues and debt underwriting fees. Trading revenue was slightly lower 
due to accounting adjustments in the equity trading business in the 

current quarter. Continued weak demand, particularly in the United 

States, contributed to lower corporate banking revenues. Non-interest 

expense increased $59 million, primarily due to higher employee costs.
Corporate Services incurred a net loss of $66 million in the 
quarter, due primarily to low revenues. Net interest income was reduced, 
in part, by a write-down on our equity investment in Symcor Inc., 

a joint-venture between certain of the banks that provides financial 

processing services. Results were $102 million better than in the 

prior year, largely due to lower provisions for credit losses, offset in 

part by higher expenses. Expenses were $58 million higher mainly 

due to increases in investment spending, professional fees and 

performance-based compensation. 
BMO’s revenue increased $240 million or 8.0% from a year ago 
to $3,229 million. There were solid increases in each of our operating 

groups, with particularly strong growth in P&C Canada, our largest 
operating group. The weaker U.S. dollar decreased revenue growth by 
$36 million or 1.2 percentage points. 
Net interest income increased $168 million or 12% from a year ago. 
Higher net interest margins in most of the operating groups produced a 

16 basis point increase at the total bank level, and drove the increase in 

net interest income, with higher average earning assets also contributing 

to the growth. Average earning assets increased $7.3 billion or 2.2% 

relative to a year ago, but adjusted to exclude the impact of the weaker 
U.S. dollar, increased by $12.5 billion. The increase was driven by 

broad-based volume growth in P&C Canada with some contribution 
from volume growth in Private Client Group. 
Non-interest revenue increased $72 million or 4.7% from a year 
ago, mostly due to strong increases in P&C Canada and Private Client 

Group. There was strong growth in card fees, due largely to the Diners 

Club business acquisition. There were solid increases in securities 

commissions, mutual fund revenues, underwriting and advisory fees, 

and investment securities gains. Securitization revenues and other 

revenues were lower. 
Non-interest expense increased $244 million or 14% from a year 
ago to $2,023 million. There was modest growth in Private Client Group 

with higher increases across the other operating groups. Approximately 

25% of expense growth was attributable to the Rockford and Diners Club 

business acquisitions, including integration costs. There were increases in 

employee compensation, due in part to staffing related to business ini-

tiatives and to performance-based compensation, in line with improved 

performance. Staffing levels increased in each of the operating groups. 

There were also significant increases in premises and equipment 

expense (notably in computer costs related to software development), 

and in professional fees and travel and business development, primarily 

related to supporting investments in the business. The weaker U.S. dollar 

reduced expense growth by $22 million or 1.2 percentage points. Cash 

operating leverage was –5.7% in the current quarter. 
Specific provisions for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2010 
were $253 million or an annualized 58 basis points of average net loans 

and acceptances, compared with $386 million or 89 basis points in the 

fourth quarter of 2009. There was no general provision in the quarter or 

in the comparable quarter. 
The provision for income taxes of $196 million increased $38 million 
from the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the quarter 

was 20.6%, compared with 19.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 93MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MD&Arevenue and net income. Results in the first quarter of 2009 were 
reduced by charges related to our decision to purchase certain holdings 

from our U.S. clients. Results in the third quarter of 2009 included a 

recovery of prior periods’ income taxes. Private Client Group is focused 

on providing a great client experience and delivering the best-in-class 

financial services that its clients expect.
BMO Capital Markets results were strong in 2009, reflecting robust 
trading performance, as we capitalized on market opportunities, and 

good corporate banking revenues as we benefited from our continued 

focus on client relationships. Strong results were achieved despite 

charges related to notable items that affected revenues in 2009. These 

charges, which related to deterioration in the capital markets environ-

ment, totalled $521 million ($355 million after tax) in 2009 and were 

concentrated in the first half of the year. In 2010, revenues improved 

from 2009 but net income was down slightly and quarterly results were 

uneven, with strong results in the second quarter and particularly weak 

net income in the third quarter. Generally, revenues in interest-rate-

sensitive businesses were lower in 2010 as market spreads were more 

favourable in 2009, and corporate banking revenues were also lower, 

reflecting a reduction in corporate loan balances. Trading revenues were 

lower in the less favourable trading environment, but mergers and 

acquisitions fees and debt underwriting revenues were higher. BMO 

Capital Markets has refocused its business over the past three years with 

the goal of improving its risk-return profile and concentrating on core 

profitable client relationships.
Corporate Services quarterly net income varies in large part because
 of our expected loss provisioning methodology, general provisions for 

credit losses and the impact of recording revenue, expenses and income 
taxes not attributed to the operating groups. Revenues were affected 

in 2009 by the impact of market interest rate changes on our balance 
sheet management activities, but the effects diminished over the course 

of the year. Results in the second quarter of 2009 were reduced by a 

$118 million ($80 million after tax) severance charge. Results were much 

improved in 2010 as revenues increased from the low levels of the first 

nine months of 2009 and provisions for credit losses were much lower. 

Corporate Services net income improved in each consecutive quarter 

of 2009 and 2010 until the most recent quarter, when net income was 

lowered by an upward movement in provisions for credit losses.
The U.S. dollar was weaker over the course of 2009, with a parti-
cularly sharp drop in the third quarter. It weakened further in 2010, 

although the decrease in its value was less pronounced. A weaker U.S. 

dollar lowers the translated value of U.S.-dollar-denominated revenues, 

expenses, provisions for credit losses, income taxes and net income. 

The effect of movements in exchange rates is sometimes muted by deci-

sions to hedge their impact within a single quarter, which is explained 

on page 36.
BMO’s provisions for credit losses measured as a percentage of 
loans and acceptances were at elevated levels in 2009. Provisions were 

lower in 2010, reflecting an improving economy and credit environment, 

although conditions remain challenging. 
The effective income tax rate can vary, as it depends on the timing 
of resolution of certain tax matters, recoveries of prior periods’ income 

taxes and the relative proportion of earnings attributable to the different 

jurisdictions in which we operate. The effective rate was more stable 

in 2010.
Caution 
This Quarterly Earnings Trends section contains forward-looking statements. 

Please see the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
Quarterly Earning Trends
BMO’s results and performance measures for the past eight quarters are 

outlined on page 95. In the second quarter of 2010, we identified U.S. 
mid-market clients that would be better served by a commercial banking
 model and transferred their business to P&C U.S. from BMO Capital 

Markets. 
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the effects 
of the transfer and conform to the current presentation. Certain other 
changes also resulted in changes to comparative figures, as detailed 
on page 43.
We have remained focused on our objectives and priorities and 
made good progress in embracing a culture that places the customer at 

the centre of everything we do. We maintained this focus in 2009 in the 

face of very difficult capital and credit market conditions, as well as a 

slowing economy. Conditions were at times challenging for some of our 

businesses in 2010, but overall economic conditions improved and we 

maintained our focus on our vision and strategy, while also reporting 

results in 2010 that were stronger than in 2009.
BMO’s quarterly earnings, revenue and expense are modestly 
affected by seasonal factors. Since our second fiscal quarter has 89 days 

and other quarters have 92 days, second-quarter results are lower rela-

tive to other quarters because there are three fewer calendar days, and 

thus fewer business days. The months of July (third quarter) and August 

(fourth quarter) are typically characterized by lower levels of capital 

markets activity, which has an effect on results in Private Client Group 

and BMO Capital Markets. The December holiday season also contributes 

to a slowdown in some activities; however, credit card purchases are 

particularly robust in that first-quarter period, as well as in the back-to-

school period that falls in our fourth quarter.
Personal and Commercial Banking earnings and revenues have 
trended higher through 2009 and 2010 and are strong.
P&C Canada has been successful in instilling its vision among 
employees, who are now firmly ali
gned behind the need to keep the 
customer at the centre of everything they do and provide a great cus-

tomer experience. P&C Canada has increased market share in some of 

its key businesses, with volume growth in most. Quarterly revenues 

have trended higher due to volume growth in most products and 

improvements in net interest margin, although margin growth was more 

subdued in 2010. Net income also increased strongly over the course of 

2009 and has generally trended higher in 2010. 
P&C U.S. has operated in a difficult economic environment in 2009 
and 2010 and results have increasingly reflected the impact of impaired 

loans, which reduces revenues and increases expenses. Results in 2010 

have also been reduced by higher levels of acquisition integration costs 

following the acquisition of select assets and liabilities of a Rockford, 

Illinois-based bank in an FDIC-assisted transaction late in the second 

quarter of 2010. The 2010 economic environment in the United States 

has also led to a drop in loan utilization, which suppressed revenue 

growth in 2010 and lowered 2010 net income relative to 2009. P&C U.S.

 is building a customer-focused culture centred on understanding and 

responding to evolving customer expectations to deliver a great 

customer experience that differentiates Harris in its markets.
Private Client Group’s results were affected in the first half of 2009 
by weak stock markets and low interest rates. Asset levels were lower 

and clients held large cash balances as they waited for markets to 

recover. Performance improved over the last six months of 2009 as 

equity markets regained strength, and the momentum continued into 

2010 as conditions in equity markets improved further, driving growth in

In 2009, we adopted new accounting requirements for intangible assets and reclassified 
certain computer equipment from premises 
and equipment to intangible assets. 
Computer and equipment expense and the amortiza
tion of intangible assets were restated 
for 2007 and 2008. As such, five-year and ten-year growth rates for these expense categories 

are not meaningful. Together, computer and eq
uipment expense and the amortization of 
intangible assets increased at a compound annu
al growth rate of 1.5% over five years and 
3.7% over ten years. Together, total premises 
and equipment expense and the amortization 
of intangible assets increased at a compound 
annual growth rate of 2.6% over five years 
and 3.5% over ten years.
 (2) Government levies are included in various non-interest expense categories.

On July 1, 2010, the harmonized sales tax was implemented in both Ontario and British 

Columbia. This has increased the sales tax paid in these two jurisdictions.

 (2)  
Effective 2010, the calculation excludes non-cont
rolling interest in subsidiaries. Prior periods 
have been restated to reflect this change. In addition, geographic allocations are not 
available, as equity is not allocated on a country of risk basis.
 (3)  
Aggregate balances are net of specific and general allowances; the consumer and 

commercial and corporate categories are stated net of specific allowances only. 
 (4)  
 Beginning with our 2009 reporting of net loans and acceptances by province, we changed 
the source of our data for the provincial distribution table. This change resulted in a shift in 

the provincial distribution to what we believe is a more accurate representation of our 

portfolio. In 2009, we restated 2008 data to reflect this change. Data for periods prior to 

2008 were not restated and therefore are not comparable.
 (5)  
In 2009, the industry allocation of impaired loans for U.S. operations was revised to reclassify 

impairment of commercial mortgages to the 
commercial mortgages category. Previously 
commercial mortgages for U.S. operations were classified in applicable industry categories. 

Periods prior to 2009 have not been restated
. (6)  
Beginning in 2008, our industry segmentation was improved to provide a split between 
government and financial institutions. For periods prior to 2008, this segmentation was not 

available, and the financial institutions sector includes government loans.
 (7)  
The U.S. portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2010 included impaired loans with an 

estimated value of $437 million, reduced to $327 million in the third quarter of 2010. Subsequent 

changes in impaired loan balances on this portfolio are included in additions to or reductions in 

impaired loans and acceptances, on a basis consistent with our other loans. All loans in the 

acquired portfolio are covered by a loss sharing agreement, with the FDIC absorbing 80% of loan 

losses. There were $302 million of gross impaired loans in this portfolio as at October 31, 2010.
 (8)  
Includes amounts returning to performing status, sales, repayments, the impact of foreign 

exchange, and offsets for consumer write-offs that are not recognized as formations.
 (9)  
Amounts for 2010 exclude a $9 million allowance for Other Credit Instruments included in 

Other Liabilities.

Beginning in fiscal 2008, capital is calculat
ed under the Basel II guidelines, whereas for all 
prior periods capital is calculated using the Basel I methodology.
 (2)  
Non-cumulative preferred shares and Innovative Tier 1 capital instruments include amounts 

that are reflected as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, but are eligible for inclusion 

in the capital calculation for regulatory purposes.
 (3)  
In 2007, OSFI approved the reclas 
sification of preferred shares issued by a subsidiary from 
Tier 2 capital to Innovative Tier 1 capital.
 (4)  
In addition to goodwill, intangible assets in excess of 5% of gross Tier 1 capital are deducted 

from Tier 1 capital.
 (5)  
When expected loss as calculated under the Advanced 
Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) Approach 

exceeds total provisions, 50% of the difference is deducted from Tier 1 capital and 50% from 

 Tier 2. When the expected loss is less than total provisions, the difference is added to Tier 2 
  capital. The general allowance related to credit risk measured under the Standardized Approach is 

included in Tier 2 capital, up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
(6)  
Under Basel I, OSFI permits the inclusion of the lesser of the balance of the general allowance 

for credit losses and 0.875% of risk-weighted assets.
(7)  
Effective November 1, 2008, substantial investments are deducted 50% from Tier 1 capital and 50% 

from Tier 2 capital. Previously these investments were deducted from Tier 2 capital. Investments in 

insurance subsidiaries held prior to January 1, 2007
 are deducted from Tier 2 capital. Effective 2012, 
these investments in insurance subsidiaries will be deducted 50% from Tier 1 capital and 50% from 

Tier 2 capital. In addition, incremental investments in insurance subsidiaries are immediately 

deducted 50% from Tier 1 capital and 50% from Tier 2 capital.

 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
 
Statement of Management’s Responsibility 
for Financial Information
 The management of Bank of Montreal (the “bank”) is responsible 
for preparation and presentation of the annual consolidated financial 

statements, Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and 

all other information in the Annual Report.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) and the applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission (“SEC”) in the United States. The financial statements 

also comply with the provisions of the 
Bank Act and related regulations, 
including interpretations of GAAP by the Office of the Superintendent 

of Financial Institutions Canada, our regulator.
The MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of securities regulators, including National Instrument 51-102 of 

the Canadian Securities Administrators (“CSA”) as well as Item 303 

of Regulation S-K under the United States
 Securities Act of 1933 
and the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
, and their related published 
requirements. 
The consolidated financial statements and information in the 
MD&A necessarily include amounts based on informed judgments and 

estimates of the expected effects of current events and transactions 

with appropriate consideration to materiality. In addition, in preparing 

the financial information we must interpret the requirements described 
above, make determinations as to the relevancy of information to 

be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported 
information. The MD&A also includes information regarding the impact 

of current transactions and events, sources of liquidity and capital 

resources, operating trends, risks and uncertainties. Actual results in 
the future may differ materially from our present assessment of this 
information because events and circumstances in the future may 

not occur as expected.
The financial information presented in the bank’s Annual Report 
is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements. 
In meeting our responsibility for 
the reliability and timeliness 
of financial information, we maintain and rely on a comprehensive 

system of internal controls and internal audit, including organizational 

and procedural controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and 

internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal controls 

includes written communication of our policies and procedures 

governing corporate conduct and risk management; comprehensive 
 William A. Downe Russel C. Robertson
 Canada
President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer December 7, 2010
business planning; effective segregation of duties; delegation of 

authority and personal accountability; escalation of relevant information 

for decisions regarding public disclosure; careful selection and training 

of personnel; and accounting policies that we regularly update. 

This structure ensures appropriate internal controls over transactions, 

assets and records. We also regularly audit internal controls. These 

controls and audits are designed to provide us with reasonable assurance 

that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements 

and other financial information, assets are safeguarded against 

unauthorized use or disposition, liabilities are recognized, and we 

are in compliance with all regulatory requirements. 
As at October 31, 2010, we, as the bank’s Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, have determined that the bank’s internal control 

over financial reporting is effective. We have certified Bank of Montreal’s 

annual filings with the CSA as re
quired in Canada under National 
Instrument 52-109 (Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and 

Interim Filings) and with the SEC as
 required in the United States 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
. In order to provide their audit opinions on our consolidated 
financial statements and on the bank’s internal control over financial 

reporting, the Shareholders’ Auditors 
audit our system of internal 
controls and conduct work to the extent that they consider appropriate. 

Their audit opinion on the bank’s system of internal controls is set 

forth below.
The Board of Directors, based on recommendations from its Audit 
Committee, reviews and approves the financial information contained 

in the Annual Report, including the MD&A. The Board of Directors and 

its relevant Committees oversee management’s responsibilities for 

the preparation and presentation of financial information, maintenance 

of appropriate internal controls, compliance with legal and regulatory 

requirements, management and control of major risk areas, and 

assessment of significant and related party transactions. 
The Audit Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent 
directors, is also responsible fo
r selecting the Shareholders’ Auditors 
and reviewing the qualifications, independence and performance of both 

the Shareholders’ Auditors and intern
al audit. The Shareholders’ Auditors 
and the bank’s Chief Auditor have full and free access to the Board of 
Directors and its Audit and other relevant committees to discuss audit, 
financial reporting and related matters.

Shareholders’ Auditors’ Reports
 
To the Shareholders of Bank of Montreal
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Bank of Montreal 
(the “bank”) as at October 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated 

statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ 

equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 

ended October 31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility 

of the bank’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 

on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally 
accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company 

Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require 

that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance 

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 

also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
of Bank of Montreal
We have audited Bank of Montreal’s (the “bank”) internal control 
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on the criteria 

established in 
Internal Control 
Œ Integrated Framework
, issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 

(“COSO”). The bank’s management is responsible for maintaining 

effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assess- 
ment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 

included on page 74 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the bank’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 

Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain 

reasonable assurance whether effective internal control over financial 

reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included 

obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 

assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 

evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 

based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such 

other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 

of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 

external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 

principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 

transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 

financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the bank as 

at October 31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations and 

its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended 

October 31, 2010 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 

accounting principles.
 Chartered Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants

December 7, 2010
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 

the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 

management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 

assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized 

acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 

a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 

of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to 
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 

in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the bank maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, 
based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control

 issued by COSO.
We also have conducted audits of the consolidated financial 
statements of the bank for each of the years in the three-year period 
ended October 31, 2010 in accordance with Canadian generally 
accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our report dated 
December 7, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
 financial statements.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mark-to-market of 
foreign exchange contracts related to economic hedges are included 

in foreign exchange, other than trading, in our Consolidated Statement 

of Income. Changes in fair value on forward contracts that qualify as 

accounting hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, with 

the spot/forward differential (the 
difference between the foreign 

currency rate at inception of the contract and the rate at the end of the 

contract) being recorded in interest expense over the term of the hedge.

Changes in Accounting Policy
During the 2010 fiscal year, there were no changes in Canadian GAAP 
accounting policies or disclosure requirements. Changes in accounting 
policies that resulted from changes by Canadian standard setters in 
2009 are disclosed as follows: financial instruments 
Œ Notes 3 and 4; 
and goodwill and intangible assets 
Œ Note 13. New disclosures that 
resulted from changes by Canadian standard setters in 2009 are presented 
as follows: risk management 
Œ Note 6; and financial instruments 
disclosures 
Œ Note 29.
Future Changes in Accounting Policy 
Transition to International Finan
cial Reporting Standards
Canadian public companies will be required to prepare their financial 

statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 

Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards 

Board (“IASB”), for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. 

Effective November 1, 2011, we will adopt IFRS as the basis for preparing 
our consolidated financial statements. We will report our financial results 
for the quarter ended January 31, 2012 prepared on an IFRS basis. 
We will also provide comparative data on an IFRS basis, including 
an opening balance sheet as at November 1, 2010 (“transition date”). 

Prior to our transition date, we will begin to address IFRS disclosure 

requirements, where appropriate. We have enhanced our disclosure 

in Note 12 
Œ Acquisitions; Note 22 
Œ Employee Compensation 
Œ Stock-Based Compensation; and Note 23 
Œ Employee Compensation 

Œ Pension and Other Employee Future Benefits to include certain 

IFRS disclosure requirements.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance 

with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), 

including interpretations of GAAP by our regulator, the Office of the 

Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (“OSFI”). We have 

included certain risk disclosures on pages 80 to 87 in the 2010 Manage-

ment’s Discussion and Analysis. To clearly identify these disclosures, 

which form an integral part of these consolidated financial statements, 

they are presented in a blue-tinted font (text and tables).
We reconcile our Canadian GAAP results to those that would be 
reported under United States GAAP. Significant differences in consolidated 

total assets, total liabilities or net income arising from applying United 
States GAAP are described in Note 30. In addition, our consolidated financial 
statements comply with certain disclosure requirements of United States 

GAAP and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 

that are applicable to us.
Basis of Consolidation
We conduct business through a variety of corporate structures, including 

subsidiaries and joint ventures. Subsidiaries are those where we 

exercise control through our ownership of the majority of the voting 

shares. Joint ventures are those where we exercise joint control through 

an agreement with other shareholders. 
All of the assets, liabilities, 
revenues and expenses of our subsid
iaries and our proportionate share 
of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of our joint ventures 

are included in our consolidated financial statements. All significant 

inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated.
We hold investments in companies where we exert significant 
influence over operating, investing and financing decisions (those 

where we own between 20% and 50% of the voting shares). These are 

recorded at cost and are adjusted for our proportionate share of any 

net income or loss and dividends. They are recorded as other securities 

in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and our proportionate share of the 

net income or loss of these companies is recorded in interest, dividend 

and fee income, securities, in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 
We hold interests in variable interest entities, which we consolidate 
where we are the primary beneficiary. These are more fully described 

in Note 9.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
We conduct business in a variety of foreign currencies and report our 
consolidated financial statements in Canadian dollars. Assets and liabilities
 denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars 

at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and 

expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the 

average exchange rate for the year.
Unrealized gains and losses arising from translating net investments
 in foreign operations into Canadian dollars, net of related hedging 
activities and applicable income taxes, are included in shareholders’ 
equity within accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation 

of net foreign operations. When we sell or liquidate an investment in a 

foreign operation, the associated translation gains and losses, previously 

included in shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive 

loss on translation of net foreign operations, are recorded as part of the 

gain or loss on disposition. All other foreign currency translation gains 

and losses are included in foreign exchange, other than trading, in our 

Consolidated Statement of Income as they arise.
From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange hedge contracts 
to reduce our exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies. 
Notes
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 115
The differences between the bank’s accounting policies and IFRS 
requirements, combined with our decisions on the optional IFRS 1 
exemptions from retroactive application of IFRS, will result in measure-

ment and recognition differences when we transition to IFRS. The net 
impact of these differences will be recorded in opening retained earnings, 
affecting shareholders’ equity. Precis
ely quantifying all of the impacts 
that will result from adopting IFRS will be subject to the completion of 
all our project work streams, finalization of all decisions where choices 
of accounting policies are available, including optional exemptions from 

retroactive restatement available under IFRS 1, and the prevailing market 

conditions and economic circumstances at the time of transition. 
Based on our analysis to date, certain of the more significant 
changes that will result from the adoption of IFRS are expected 
to be in the areas of pension and other employee future benefits, asset 
securitization, consolidation and accumulated other comprehensive 

loss on translation of foreign operations.
The differences described in the sections that follow are based on 
Canadian GAAP and IFRS that are in effect as of this date. This should not 

be considered a comprehensive list of the main accounting changes 

when we adopt IFRS.
Pension and Other Employee Future Beneﬁ
 tsUnder the IFRS employee benefits standard (IAS 19), we will continue to 

record pension and other employee future benefits expense as cost of 

benefits earned in the year plus the interest cost on the obligation, net 

of the expected return on assets. IFRS provides two alternatives for how 

to account for the unrealized market-related gains or losses on pension 

fund assets and the impact of changes in discount rates on pension 

obligations (“market-related amounts”). We can either record these 

market-related amounts directly in equity or defer them on our balance 

sheet and amortize amounts in excess of 10% of our plan assets or 

benefit liability balances to pension expense over a period of approxi-

mately 12 years. We currently follow the second alternative. We have not 

yet finalized our decision on which alternative to elect for the accounting 

of market-related amounts. Additional information on our pension and 

other employee future benefits is included in Note 23.
On transition to IFRS, we can either recalculate pension expense 
back to inception of the plans as though we had always applied the 

IFRS pension requirements or, alternatively, record market-related 

amounts that exist on November 1, 2010 directly in retained earnings 

(“fresh start method”). 
Should the bank elect the fresh start method, the impact 
on the bank’s balance sheet would be a reduction in opening retained 

earnings of approximately $1,200 million, a decrease in other assets 

of approximately $1,600 million and a decrease in other liabilities of 

approximately $400 million on November 1, 2010, the beginning of our 

comparative year. Adopting this alternative would also result in reduced 

pension expense in future years since any deferred losses that exist 

on October 31, 2010 would not be amortized to pension expense.
We have not yet finalized our decision on whether to elect the 
fresh start method as permitted under IFRS.
Asset Securitization
We have substantially completed our assessment of certain of our 

significant asset securitization programs and whether the loans and 

mortgages sold through these programs qualify for off-balance sheet 

treatment under IFRS. The assessment included our Canadian credit 

card loans and Canadian mortgage loans sold to the bank’s securitization 

vehicles and to the Canada Mortgage Bond program, a third-party 

securitization program. We assessed whether the loans and mortgages 

qualify for off-balance sheet treatment based on the transfer of 

the risks and rewards, as determined under the derecognition criteria 

contained in the IFRS financial instruments standard (IAS 39). Based 

on the analysis completed to date, our preliminary conclusion is 

that the loans or mortgages sold under these securitization programs 
will not qualify for off-balance sheet recognition under IFRS. Under 

Canadian GAAP, the mortgages and loans sold through these programs 

are removed from our balance sheet. Additional information on our asset 

securitization vehicles is included in Note 8.
If the securitized assets sold to the securitization vehicles 
noted in the preceding paragraph were to be recognized on the bank’s 

balance sheet, assets and liabilities would increase by approximately 
$18 billion and opening retained earnings would be reduced by less than 
$100 million on November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative 
year. The reduction in retained earnings primarily represents the reversal 

of the gain on sale previously recognized in earnings. In addition, the 

interest and fees collected from customers, net of the yield paid to 

investors in the securitization vehicle, would be recorded in net interest 

income using the effective interest rate method over the term of the 
securitization and credit losses associated with loans and mortgages would 
be recorded in the provision for credit losses. 
We have not completed our assessment of the asset securitization 
activity associated with selling the bank’s Canadian mortgage loans 

to certain other third-party asset securitization programs. 
Consolidation
We have substantially completed our assessment of whether we are 

required to consolidate our credit protection vehicle and our structured 

investment vehicles when we transition to IFRS. We assessed the 
consolidation requirement based on whether the bank would in substance
 control the vehicles, as determined under the criteria contained in 
the IFRS consolidated and separate financial statements standard (IAS 27)
 and, where appropriate, SIC-12 (an interpretation of IAS 27). Our analysis 

considered whether the activities of the vehicles are conducted 

on behalf of the bank, the bank’s e
xposure to the risks and benefits, 
its decision-making powers over the vehicles, and whether these 

considerations demonstrate that the bank in substance controls the 

vehicles and therefore must consolidate them.
Information on these vehicles, including total assets, our 
exposure to loss and our assessment
 of the consolidation requirement 
under Canadian GAAP, is included in Note 9. 
Credit Protection Vehicle
Based on the analysis completed to date, our preliminary conclusion 

is that the bank would be required to consolidate this vehicle, 
as our analysis indicates that the bank in substance controls this vehicle 
based on the definition of control under IFRS. Under Canadian GAAP, 

we are not required to consolidate this vehicle.
Consolidation of this vehicle would impact the bank’s balance 
sheet, increasing assets and liabilities by approximately $500 million on 

November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year. Our estimate 

incorporates the elections permitted under IFRS to fair value certain 

assets and liabilities of the credit protection vehicle, with changes in the 

fair value recorded in income as they occur. 
Structured Investment Vehicles (“SIVs”)
Based on the analysis completed to date, our preliminary conclusion 

is that the bank would be required to consolidate the SIVs, as our 
analysis indicates that the bank in substance controls the SIVs based on 
the definition of control under IFRS. Under Canadian GAAP, we are not 
required to consolidate the SIVs.
Consolidation of the SIVs would impact the bank’s balance 
sheet, increasing assets and liabilities on the bank’s balance sheet by 

approximately $200 million on November 1, 2010, the beginning of 

our comparative year. This represents
 the amount by which the assets 
of the SIVs exceed the amount draw
n on the loan facility the bank 
has made available to the SIVs as of November 1, 2010. Our estimate 

incorporates the election permitted under IFRS to fair value the assets 

and liabilities of the SIVs, with changes in the fair value recorded in 

income as they occur. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes

BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
We do not expect consolidation of these vehicles would result 
in any significant adjustment to opening retained earnings. 
We have not completed our assessment of our U.S. customer 
securitization vehicle and our Canadian customer securitization vehicles 
and other less significant VIEs. 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on 
Translation of Foreign Operations
On transition to IFRS, we can either recalculate translation differences 
on an IFRS basis as though we had always applied the IFRS requirements, 
or reset the accumulated other comprehensive loss on translation of net 
foreign operations to zero. We expect to elect to reset our accumulated 
other comprehensive loss on translation of net foreign operations to zero. 
The impact on the bank’s balance sheet will be an increase of $1,100 mil-

lion in accumulated other compre 
hensive income and a 
corresponding 
reduction in retained earnings of approximately $1,100 million
 on 
November 1, 2010, the beginning of our comparative year.

Note 3: Securities 
Use of Estimates
In preparing our consolidated financial statements we must make 
estimates and assumptions, mainly concerning fair values, which 

affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net income and related 

disclosures. The most significant assets and liabilities for which we 

must make estimates include: measurement of other than temporary 

impairment 
Œ Note 3; valuation of securities at fair value 
Œ Note 3; 
allowance for credit losses 
Œ Note 4; accounting for securitizations 
Œ Note 8; consolidation of variable interest entities 
Œ Note 9; valuation 
of derivative instruments at fair value 
Œ Note 10; goodwill and intangible 
assets 
Œ Note 13; 
insurance-related liabilities 
Œ Note 16; pension and 
other employee future
 benefits 
Œ Note 23; income taxes 
Œ Note 24; 
contingent liabilities 
Œ Note 28; and fair value of financial instruments 

Œ Note 29. If actual results differ from the estimates, the impact 

would be recorded in future periods.
Cash Restrictions
Some of our foreign operations are required to maintain reserves 
or minimum balances with central banks in their respective countries 

of operation, amounting to $461 million as at October 31, 2010 

($326 million as at October 31, 2009). 
Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks
Deposits with banks are recorded at amortized cost and include accep 
-tances we have purchased that were issued by other banks. Interest 

income earned on these deposits is recorded on an accrual basis.
Changes in Accounting Policy 
On August 20, 2009, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants 

(“CICA”) released new accounting requirements relating to the 
classification and measurement of financial assets. The new standard 

redefined loans and receivables to include all non-derivative financial 

assets with fixed or determinable repayment terms which are not 

quoted in an active market. The standard also permits reclassification 

of available-for-sale securities to loans when there is no active market. 

Impairment on the reclassified debt securities will be calculated in a 

manner consistent with our loan portfolio, based on our assessment of 

the recoverability of principal and interest.
This change in accounting policy does not have any impact on our 
results of operations or financial position since we were not required 

to and did not elect to transfer any available-for-sale securities to loans.
During October 2008, the CICA issued amendments to Handbook 
section 3855 “Financial Instruments 
Œ Recognition and Measurement”, 

section 3861 “Financial Instruments 
Œ Disclosure and Presentation” 

and section 3862 “Financial Instruments 
Œ Disclosure”. The amendments 
permit, in rare circumstances, certain reclassifications of non-derivative 

financial assets from the trading category to either the available-for-sale 

or held-to-maturity categories. It also permits the reclassification of 

certain available-for-sale loans to loans and receivables.
We elected to transfer from trading to available-for-sale those 
securities for which we had a change in intent to hold the securities 

for the foreseeable future rather than to exit or trade them in the short 
term due to market circumstances at that time. In accordance with 
the amendments, we recognized the tr
ansfers at the fair value of the 
securities on August 1, 2008.
A continuity of the transferred securities is as follows:

trading assets ranged from 2% to 17%, with expected recoverable cash 

flows of $2.2 billion. Ranges of effective interest rates were determined 

based on weighted-average rates of the portfolios transferred.
Fair value changes recorded in other comprehensive income 
would have resulted in a gain of $55 million being recorded in income 

for the year ended October 31, 2010 (gain of $232 million in 2009) if 
the securities had not been transferred from trading to available-for-sale. 
Interest and dividend income of $26 million related to the transferred 

securities was recorded in interest, dividend and fee income, 

securities in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year 

ended October 31, 2010 ($57 million in 2009).

Securities
Securities are divided into three types, each with a different purpose and 
accounting treatment. The three types of securities we hold are as follows:
Trading securities 
are securities that we purchase for resale over a 
short period of time. We report these securities at their fair value and 

record the fair value changes and transaction costs in our Consolidated 

Statement of Income in trading revenues.
Fair Value Option
Securities designated as trading under the fair value option are financial 

instruments that may be accounted for at fair value, with changes 

in fair value recorded in income provided they meet certain criteria. 

Securities designated as trading under the fair value option must 

have reliably measurable fair value and satisfy one of the following 

criteria established by OSFI: (1) accounting for them at fair value 

eliminates or significantly reduces an inconsistency in measurement 

or recognition that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or 

liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on a different 

basis, (2) the securities are part of a group of financial assets, financial 

liabilities or both that is managed and its performance evaluated on 
a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management 
or investment strategy, and is reported to key management personnel 
on a fair value basis, or (3) the securities are hybrid financial instru-
ments with one or more embedded derivatives that would otherwise 

be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately from the 

host contract. Financial instruments must be designated when they 

are acquired, and the designation is irrevocable. These securities 

would otherwise be accounted for as available-for-sale securities with 

unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
Securities held by our insurance subsidiaries that support our 
insurance liabilities are designated 
as trading securities under the fair 
value option. Since the actuarial calc
ulation of insurance liabilities is 
based on the fair value of the i
nvestments supporting them, electing 

the fair value option for these investments better aligns the accounting 

result with the way the portfolio is managed. The fair value of these 

securities as at October 31, 2010 was $4,153 million ($3,167 million in 
2009). The impact of recording these as trading securities was an increase
 in non-interest revenue, insurance income of $298 million for the year 

ended October 31, 2010 (increase of $415 million in 2009).
Available-for-sale securities 
consist of debt and equity securities 
that may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest 
rates and resulting prepayment risk, changes in foreign currency 

risk, changes in funding sources or terms, or to meet liquidity needs.
Available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value with 
unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehen-

sive income (loss) on available-for-sale securities in our Consolidated 

Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity until the security is 

sold, or if an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary. Gains 

and losses on disposal and other than temporary impairment losses 

are recorded 
in our Consolidated Statement of Income in securities gains 
(losses), other
 than trading. Interest income earned and dividends 
received on available-for-sale securities are recorded in our Consolidated 

Statement of Income in interest, dividend and fee income, securities. 

We have not classified any of our securities as held-to-maturity. 

Available-for-sale securities whose sale is restricted are recorded 

at amortized cost.
Investments made by our insurance operations are classified as 
available-for-sale or other securities, except for investments that support 
the policy benefit liabilities on 
our insurance contracts, which are 
designated as trading securities under 
the fair value option as discussed 
above. Interest and other fee income on available-for-sale securities 

is recognized when earned in our Consolidated Statement of Income 

in non-interest revenue, insurance income.
Merchant banking investments
, which are included in other securities in 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet, are securities held by our merchant bank-

ing subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for their investments at fair 

value, with changes in fair value recorded in our Consolidated Statement 

of Income in securities gains (losses), other than trading as they occur. 
Transaction costs for non-trading securities are expensed.
We account for all of our securities transactions using settlement date 
accounting on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For securities classified 
or designated as trading, changes in fair value between the trade date 
and settlement date are recorded in net income. For available-for-sale 

securities, changes in fair value between the trade date and settlement 

date are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Impairment Review
We review available-for-sale securities and investments where we exert 

significant influence, but not control, at each quarter end to identify 

and evaluate investments that show indications of possible impairment. 

An investment is considered impaired if its unrealized losses represent 

impairment that is considered to be other than temporary.
In determining whether a loss is temporary, factors considered 
include the extent of the unrealized 
loss, the length of time that the 
security has been in an unrealized loss position, the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intention or obligation to 
sell the investment before any anticipated recovery. If the decline is con-
sidered not to be temporary, a write-down is recorded in our Consolidated
 Statement of Income in securities gains (losses), other than trading. 
For debt securities classified as available-for-sale, a previous 
impairment loss is reversed through net income if an event occurs after 

the impairment was recognized that can be objectively attributed to 

an increase in fair value. 
As at October 31, 2010, we had 118 available-for-sale securities 
(250 in 2009) with unrealized losses totalling $25 million (unrealized 

losses of $199 million in 2009). Of these available-for-sale securities, 

54 have been in an unrealized loss position continuously for more than 

one year (93 in 2009), amounting to an unrealized loss position of 

$10 million (unrealized loss position of $74 million in 2009). Unrealized 

losses on these instruments, excluding corporate equities, resulted 
from changes in interest rates and not from deterioration in the credit-

worthiness of the issuers. We expect full recovery of principal and 

interest payments from certain debt securities due to governmental 
support and/or over-collateraliza
tion provided. The share prices and 
valuations of many equity securities that we hold have also appreciated 

from earlier levels. Based on these factors and our intention to 

not sell these securities before any anticipated recovery, we have 

determined that the unrealized losses are temporary in nature.
We did not own any securities issued by a single non-government entity 
where the book value, as at October 31, 2010 or 2009, was greater than 
10% of our shareholders’ equity. 
Included in other securities are investments where we exert significant 
influence, but not control, of $196 million and $613 million as at October 31, 
2010 and 2009, respectively.
Fair Value Measurement
For traded securities, quoted market value is considered to be fair value. 
Quoted market value is based on bid prices. For securities where market 
quotes are not available, we use estimation techniques to determine fair 
value. These estimation techniques include discounted cash flows, internal
 models that utilize observable market data or comparisons with other 

securities that are substantially the same. In limited circumstances, we 
use internal models where the inputs are not based on observable market 
data. Further discussion of fair value measurement is included in Note 29.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
Change in Accounting Policy
During August 2009, the CICA issued amendments to Handbook 
section 3855 “Financial Instruments 
Œ Recognition and Measurement” 
on the classification and measurement of financial assets. For details of 

the impact of our adoption of this new standard, see Note 3.
Loans
Loans are recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
 This method allocates interest income over the expected term by 

applying the effective interest rate to the carrying amount of the loan. 
The effective interest rate is defined as the rate that exactly discounts 

estimated future cash receipts through the expected term of the loan. 

The treatment of interest income for impaired loans is described below.
We amortize deferred loan origination costs using the effective 
interest method. We record the amortization as a reduction to interest, 

dividend and fee income, loans, over the term of the resulting loan. 

Under the effective interest method, the amount recognized in interest, 

dividend and fee income varies over the term of the loan based on 

the principal outstanding.
Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Resale Agreements
Securities borrowed or purchased u
nder resale agreements represent the 
amounts we will receive as a result of our commitment to resell securities
 that we have purchased back to the original seller, on a specified date at 
a specified price. We account for these instruments as if they were loans.
Lending Fees
The accounting treatment for lending fees varies depending on the 

transaction. Some loan origination, restructuring and renegotiation 

fees are recorded as interest income over the term of the loan, while 

other lending fees to a certain threshold are taken into income at the 

time of loan origination. Commitment fees are recorded as interest 

income over the term of the loan, unless we believe the loan commit-

ment will not be used. In the latter case, commitment fees are recorded 

as lending fees over the commitment period. Loan syndication fees are 

included in lending fees as the syndication is completed, unless the yield 

on any loans we retain is less than that of other comparable lenders 

involved in the financing. In the latter case, an appropriate portion of the 

syndication fee is recorded as interest income over the term of the loan.
Customers’ Liability under Acceptances
Acceptances represent a form of negotiable short-term debt that is 

issued by our customers and which we guarantee for a fee. We have 

offsetting claims, equal to the amount of the acceptances, against 

our customers in the event of a call
 on these commitments. The amount 
due under acceptances is recorded in other liabilities and our corre-
sponding claim is recorded as a loan in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Fees earned are recorded in lending fees in our Consolidated 
Statement of Income.
Impaired Loans
We classify residential mortgages as impaired when payment is contractually 

90 days past due, or one year past due if guaranteed by the Government of 

Canada. Credit card loans are classified as impaired and immediately written 
off when principal or interest payments are 180 days past due. Consumer 

instalment loans, other personal loans and some small business loans are 

classified as impaired when principal or interest payments are 90 days past 
due, and are normally written off when they are one year past due.
Corporate and commercial loans are classified as impaired when 
we are no longer reasonably assured that principal or interest will be 

collected on a timely basis, or when payments are 90 days past due, or 

for fully secured loans, when payments are 180 days past due.
We do not accrue interest income on loans classified as impaired, 
and any interest income that is accrued and unpaid is reversed against 
interest income.
Payments received on corporate and commercial loans that have 
been classified as impaired are applied first to the recovery of collection 
costs, principal and any previous 
write-offs or allowances, and any 
amounts remaining are then recorded as interest income. Payments 
received on impaired consumer instalment loans are applied first to 

outstanding interest and then to the remaining principal.
A loan will be reclassified back to performing status when we 
determine that there is reasonable assurance of full and timely 

repayment of interest and principal in accordance with the terms and 

conditions of the loan, and that none of the criteria for classification 

of the loan as impaired continue to apply.
From time to time we restructure loans, classified as impaired, 
due to the poor financial condition of the borrower. If they are no longer 

considered impaired, interest on these restructured loans is recorded 

on an accrual basis.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses recorded in our Consolidated Balance 

Sheet is maintained at a level that we consider adequate to absorb 

credit-related losses on our loans, 
customers’ liability under acceptances 
and other credit instruments (as discussed in Note 5). The portion 

related to other credit instruments is recorded in other liabilities in 

our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The allowance comprises the following two components:
Specific Allowances
These allowances are recorded for specific loans to reduce their book value 

to the amount we expect to recover. We review our loans and acceptances 
on an ongoing basis to assess whether any loans should be classified 

as impaired and whether an allowance or write-off should be recorded 

(other than credit card loans, which are classified as impaired and 

written off when principal or interest payments are 180 days past due, 

as discussed under impaired loans). Our review of problem loans is 

conducted at least quarterly by our account managers, each of whom 

assesses the ultimate collectability and estimated recoveries for a specific 

loan based on all events and conditions that the manager believes are 

relevant to the condition of the loan. This assessment is then reviewed 

and concurred with by an independent credit officer.
To determine the amount we expect to recover from an impaired 
loan, we use the value of the estimated future cash flows discounted 

at the effective rate inherent in 
the loan. When the amounts and timing 
of future cash flows cannot be estimated with reasonable reliability, 

the expected recovery amount is esti
mated using either the fair value of 
any security underlying the loan, net of expected costs of realization and 

any amounts legally required to be paid to the borrower, or an observ-

able market price for the loan. Security can vary by type of loan and may 

include cash, securities, real property, accounts receivable, guarantees, 

inventory or other capital assets. For personal loans that are not 

individually assessed, specific provisions are calculated on a pooled 

basis, taking into account historical loss experience.
General Allowance
We maintain a general allowance in order to cover any impairment 

in the existing portfolio that cannot yet be associated with specific loans. 

Our approach to establishing and maintaining the general allowance 

is based on the guideline issued by OSFI.
The general allowance is reviewed on a quarterly basis. A number 
of factors are considered when determining the appropriate level of 

the general allowance, including 
a general allowance model that applies 
historical expected and unexpected loss rates to current balances 

with sensitivity to risk ratings, industry sectors and credit products. 

Model results are then considered along with the level of the existing 

allowance, as well as management’s judgment regarding portfolio 

quality, business mix, and economic and credit market conditions.
Provision for Credit Losses
Changes in the value of our loan portfolio due to credit-related losses or 
recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are included 

in the provision for credit losses in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

.Foreclosed Assets
Property or other assets that we have received from borrowers to satisfy 
their loan commitments are recorded at fair value and are classified as 

either held for use or held for sale according to management’s intention. 

Fair value is determined based on market prices where available. 
Included in loans as at October 31, 2010 are $46,738 million ($49,508 million and $66,081 million in 2009 
and 2008) of loans denominated in U.S. dollars and $1,469 million ($1,945 million and $2,608 million in 

2009 and 2008) of loans denominated in other foreign currencies. 
Otherwise, fair value is determined using other methods, such as 
analysis of discounted cash flows or market prices for similar assets.
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we foreclosed on 
impaired loans and received $124 million in real estate properties that 

we classified as held for sale ($70 million in 2009). These properties 

are disposed of when market conditions are favourable.
Fully secured loans with past due amounts between 90 and 180 days that we have not classified 
as impaired totalled $154 million and $187 million as at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Impaired Loans
Our average gross impaired loans and acceptances were $3,255 million 
for the year ended October 31, 2010 ($2,850 million in 2009). Our average
 impaired loans, net of the specific allowance, were $2,589 million for 
the year ended October 31, 2010 ($2,325 million in 2009).
During the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 
we would have recorded additional interest income of $111 million, 
We have an enterprise-wide approach
 to the identification, measurement, 
monitoring and management of risks faced across the organization. 

The key financial instrument risks are classified as credit and counter-

party, market, and liquidity and funding risk.
Credit and Counterparty Risk
We are exposed to credit risk from the possibility that counterparties 

may default on their financial obligations to us. Credit risk arises 

predominantly with respect to loans, over-the-counter derivatives and 

other credit instruments. This is the most significant measurable risk that 

we face. Our risk management practices and key measures are disclosed 

in the text and tables presented in a blue-tinted font in Management’s 

Discussion and Analysis on pages 80 to 81 of this report. Additional 

information on loans and derivative-related credit risk is disclosed in 

Notes 4 and 10, respectively.
Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk 
Concentrations of credit risk exist if a number of clients are engaged 

in similar activities, are located in the same geographic region or 

have similar economic characteristics such that their ability to meet 
con tractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations of credit risk 
indicate a related sensitivity of our performance to developments 
affecting a particular counterparty, industry or geographic location. 
At year-end, our credit assets consisted of a well-diversified port-

folio representing millions of clients, the majority of them consumers 

and small to medium-sized businesses.
From an industry viewpoint, our most significant exposure as at 
year-end was to the individual consumers, captured in the “individual 
sector”, comprising $136.8 billion.
Basel II Framework
We use the Basel II Framework for our capital management framework. 
The framework uses exposure at default to assess credit and counterparty
 risk. Exposures are classified as follows:
• Drawn loans include loans, acceptances, deposits with regulated 
financial institutions, and certain securities. Exposure at default (“EAD”)
 represents an estimate of the outst
anding amount of a credit exposure 
at the time a default may occur. For off-balance sheet amounts and 

undrawn amounts, EAD includes an 
estimate of any further amounts 

that may be drawn at the time of default.
• Undrawn commitments cover all unutilized authorizations, including 
those which are unconditionally cancellable. Exposure at default 

for undrawn commitments is based on management’s best estimate.
• Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives are those in our proprietary 
accounts that attract credit risk in addition to market risk. Exposure 

at default for OTC derivatives is equal to the net gross replacement 

cost plus any potential credit exposure amount.
• Other off-balance sheet exposures include items such as guarantees 

and standby letters of credit and documentary credits. Exposure 

at default for other off-balance sheet items is based on management’s 

best estimate.
• Repo style transactions include repos, reverse repos and securities 
lending transactions, which represent both asset and liability exposures.
 Exposure at default for repo style transactions is the total amount 

drawn, adding back any write-offs.
• Adjusted EAD represents exposures that have been redistributed to 
a more favourable probability of default band or a different Basel asset
 class as a result of applying credit risk mitigation.
$119 million and $102 million, respectively, if we had not classified 

any loans as impaired.
Cash interest income of $2 million was recognized on impaired 
loans during the year ended October 31, 2010 ($nil in 2009 and 2008).
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we recorded a loss of 
$4 million (loss of $24 million in 2009) on the sale of impaired loans.
We use other off-balance sheet credit instruments as a method of 

meeting the financial needs of our customers. Summarized below are 

the types of instruments that we use:
• Standby letters of credit and guarantees represent our obligation 
to make payments to third parties on behalf of another party if 

that party is unable to make the required payments or meet other 

contractual requirements. Standby letters of credit and guarantees 

include our guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt to a third party;
• Securities lending represents our credit exposure when we lend 
our securities, or our customers’ se
curities, to third parties should 
a securities borrower default on its redelivery obligation;
• Documentary and commercial letters of credit represent our agree-
ment to honour drafts presented by a third party upon completion 

of specific activities; and
• Commitments to extend credit represent our commitment to our 
customers to grant them credit in the form of loans or other financings 

for specific amounts and maturities, subject to their meeting certain 

conditions.
The contractual amount of our other credit instruments represents the 

maximum undiscounted potential credit risk if the counterparty does not 
perform according to the terms of the contract, before possible recoveries
 under recourse and collateral provisions. Collateral requirements for 

these instruments are consistent with collateral requirements for loans. 

A large majority of these commitments expire without being drawn 

upon. As a result, the total contractual amounts may not be representa-

tive of the funding likely to be required for these commitments.
We strive to limit credit risk by dealing only with counterparties 
that we believe are creditworthy, and we manage our credit risk 

for other credit instruments using the same credit risk process that 

is applied to loans and other credit assets.

Market Risk
Market risk is the potential for a negative impact on the balance sheet 

and/or statement of income resulting from adverse changes in the

Liquidity and Funding Risk
Liquidity and funding risk is the potential for loss if we are unable 
to meet financial commitments in a timely manner at reasonable prices
 as they fall due. It is our policy to ensure that sufficient liquid assets 
and funding capacity are available to meet financial commitments, 

including liabilities to depositors and suppliers, and lending, investment 

and pledging commitments, even in times of stress. Managing liquidity 

and funding risk is essential to maintaining both depositor confidence 

and stability in earnings.
Our liquidity and funding risk management practices and key 
measures are outlined in the text presented in a blue-tinted font in the 

Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of Management’s Discussion 

and Analysis on pages 85 to 86 of this report.

In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of guarantees. 
Guarantees include contracts where we may be required to make 

payments to a counterparty, based on changes in the value of an asset, 

liability or equity security that the counterparty holds, due to changes 

in an underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable. 

In addition, contracts under which we may be required to make 

payments if a third party does not perform according to the terms of 

a contract and 
contracts under which we provide indirect guarantees 
of the indebtedness 
of another party are considered guarantees.
The most significant guarantees are as follows:
Standby Letters of Credit and Guarantees
Standby letters of credit and guarantees represent our obligation to 

make payments to third parties on behalf of another party if that party 

is unable to make the required payments or meet other contractual 

requirements. The maximum amount
 payable under standby letters 

of credit and guarantees totalled $10,163 million as at October 31, 2010 

($11,384 million in 2009). None of the letters of credit or guarantees 

had an investment rating in 2010 or 2009. Collateral requirements 

for standby letters of credit and guarantees are consistent with our 

collateral requirements for loans. A large majority of these commitments 

expire without being drawn upon. As a result, the total contractual 

amounts may not be representative of
 the funding likely to be required 
for these commitments.
As at October 31, 2010, $9 million ($nil in 2009) was included 
in other liabilities related to a guaranteed party that was unable 

to meet its obligation to a third party (see Note 4). No other amount 
was included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as at October 31, 2010 

and 2009 related to these standby letters of credit and guarantees.
Backstop and Other Liquidity Facilities
Backstop liquidity facilities are provided to asset-backed commercial 

paper (“ABCP”) programs administered by either us or third parties as an 
alternative source of financing in the event that such programs are unable
 to access ABCP markets or when predetermined performance measures 

of the financial assets owned by these programs are not met. The terms 
of the backstop liquidity facilities do not require us to advance money to 
these programs in the event of bankruptcy of the borrower. The facilities’ 

terms are generally no longer than one year, but can be several years. 
The maximum amount payable under these backstop and 
other liquidity facilities totalled $14,009 million as at October 31, 2010 

($19,108 million in 2009), of which $11,036 million relates to facilities 

that are investment grade, $625 million that are non-investment grade 

and $2,348 million that are not rated ($15,405 million, $649 million and 

$3,054 million, respectively, in 2009). As at October 31, 2010, $292 million 

was outstanding from facilities drawn in accordance with the terms 

of the backstop liquidity facilities ($185 million in 2009), of which 

$251 million (US$246 million) ($158 million or US$146 million in 2009) 

related to our U.S. customer securitization vehicle discussed in Note 9.
Credit Enhancement Facilities
Where warranted, we provide partial credit enhancement facilities 

to transactions within ABCP programs administered by either us or third 

parties. Credit enhancement facilities are included in backstop liquidity 

facilities. These facilities include amounts that relate to our U.S. customer 

securitization vehicle discussed in Note 9.
Senior Funding Facilities
We also provide senior funding su
pport to our structured investment 
vehicles (“SIVs”) and our credit protection vehicle. As at October 31, 2010, 

$5,097 million had been drawn ($7,230 million in 2009) in accordance 
with the terms of the funding facilities
 related to the SIVs. As at Octo-
ber 31, 2010, $nil had been drawn down in accordance with the terms of 
Note 7: Guarantees
the funding facility provided to our credit protection vehicle ($112 million 

in 2009). Further information on these funding facilities is provided in 

Note 9.
In addition to our investment in the notes subject to the 
Montreal Accord, we have provided a senior loan facility of $300 million. 

No amounts were drawn as at October 31, 2010.
Derivatives
Certain of our derivative instruments meet the accounting definition of 

a guarantee when we believe they are related to an asset, liability or 
equity security held by the guaranteed party at the inception of a contract. 
In order to reduce our exposure to these derivatives, we enter into 

contracts that hedge the related risks.
Written credit default swaps require us to compensate a counter-
party following the occurrence of a credit event in relation to a specified 

reference obligation, such as a bond or a loan. The maximum amount 

payable under credit default swaps is equal to their notional amount of 

$40,650 million as at October 31, 2010 ($51,072 million in 2009), of which 

$37,764 million relates to swaps that are investment grade, $2,622 mil-

lion that are non-investment grade and $264 million that are not rated 

($45,843 million, $5,034 million and $195 million, respectively, in 

2009). The terms of these contracts range from one day to 12 years. 

The fair value of the related derivative liabilities included in derivative 

instruments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $933 million as 

at October 31, 2010 ($2,159 million in 2009).
Written options include contractual agreements that co
nvey to 
the purchaser the right
, but not the obligation, to require us to buy 
a specific amount of a currency, commodity, debt or equity instrument 

at a fixed price, either at a fixed future date or at any time within a 

fixed future period. The maximum amount payable under these written 

options cannot be reasonably estimated due to the nature of these 
contracts. The terms of these contracts range from less than one month to
 eight years. The fair value of the related derivative liabilities included in 
derivative instruments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $599 million 

as at October 31, 2010 ($667 million in 2009), none of which have an 

investment rating (none of which had an investment rating in 2009).
Written options also include contractual agreements where 
we agree to pay the purchaser, b
ased on a specified notional amount, 
the difference between a market price or rate and the strike price or 

rate of the underlying instrument
. The maximum amount payable under 
these contracts is not determinable due to their nature. The terms of 

these contracts range from 11 months to 25 years. The fair value of the 

related derivative liabilities included in derivative instruments in our 

Consolidated Balance Sheet was $87 million as at October 31, 2010 

($118 million in 2009), none of which have an investment rating (none 

of which were rated in 2009).
Indemnification Agreements
In the normal course of operations, we enter into various agreements 

that provide general indemnifications. These indemnifications typically 

occur in connection with sales of assets, securities offerings, service 

contracts, membership agreements, clearing arrangements, derivatives 

contracts and leasing transactions. These indemnifications require us, 

in certain circumstances, to comp
ensate the counterparties for various 
costs resulting from breaches of representations or obligations under such
 arrangements, or as a result of third-party claims that may be suffered 

by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. The terms 
of these indemnifications vary based on the contract, the nature of which 
prevents us from making a reasonable 
estimate of the maximum amount
 we could be required to pay to counterparties.
No material amount was included in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as at October 31, 2010 and 2009 related to these indemnifications.

Note 8: Asset Securitization
Periodically, we securitize loans to obtain alternate sources of funding. 
Securitization involves selling loans to off-balance sheet entities or trusts 

(“securitization vehicles”), which buy the loans and then issue either 

interest bearing or discounted investor certificates.
Contracts with the securitization vehicles provide for the payment 
to us over time of the excess of the sum of interest and fees collected 

from customers, in connection with the loans that were sold, over the 

yield paid to investors in the securitization vehicle, less credit losses and 

other costs (the “deferred purchase price”).
We account for transfers to securitization vehicles as sales when 
control over the loans is given up and consideration other than notes 
issued by the securitization vehicle has been received. For control to have
 transferred, (1) the transferred loans must be isolated from the seller, even
 in the event of bankruptcy or receiver
ship of the seller, (2) the purchaser 
must have the right to sell or pledge the transferred loans or, if the 

purchaser is a Qualifying Special 
Purpose Entity (“QSPE”) as defined in 
CICA Accounting Guideline 12, “Transfers of Receivables”, the investors 

in the QSPE must have the right to sell or pledge their ownership interest 

in the QSPE, and (3) the seller cannot 
retain the right to repurchase 
the loans and receive more than an insignificant benefit. When the loans 

are considered sold for accounting purposes, we remove them from our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize gains in securitization revenues
 at the time of the sale. These gai
ns are determined based on our best 
estimate of the net present value of expected future cash flows, primarily 
the deferred purchase price, net of our estimate of the fair value of any 

servicing obligations undertaken. The 
deferred purchase price is recorded 
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in available-for-sale securities.
A servicing liability is recognized only for securitizations where we 
do not receive adequate compensation for servicing the transferred loans. 
It is initially measured at fair value and is recorded in our Consolidated 

Balance Sheet in other liabilities. A servicing liability is amortized to 

securitization revenues over the term of the transferred loans.
For some of our securitizations, 
we are required to purchase sub 
- ordinated interests or to maintain cash amounts deposited with the 

securitization vehicle that are considered retained interests in the 

securitized assets. This provides the securitization vehicle with a source 

of funds in the event that the sum of
 interest and fees collected on the 
loans is not sufficient to pay the interest owed to investors. We record 

these retained interests at their fair value in available-for-sale securities 

in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These interests, together with the 

deferred purchase price, represent our exposure with respect to these 

securitizations. Investors have no fu
rther recourse against us in the event 
that cash flows from the transferred loans are inadequate to service 

the interest related to the investor certificates.

The adjacent table outlines the key economic assumptions used in 

measuring the deferred purchase price and servicing liability and the 
sensitivity of these retained interests as at October 31, 2010 to immediate
 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions. The sensitivity 

analysis should be used with caution as it is hypothetical and the impact 

of changes in each key assumption may not be linear. The sensitivities 

to changes in each key variable have been calculated independently 
of the impact of changes in the other key variables. Actual experience 
may result in simultaneous changes in a number of key assumptions. 
Changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could 

amplify or reduce certain sensitivities.

Note 9: Variable Interest Entities
Variable interest entities (“VIEs”) include entities whose equity is 
considered insufficient to finance its activities or for which the equity-

holders do not have a controlling financial interest. We are required 
to consolidate VIEs if the investments we hold in these entities and/or 
the relationships we have with them result in us being exposed to the 
majority of their expected losses, being able to benefit from a majority 
of their expected residual returns, or both. We determine this based on 

a quantitative assessment that involves estimating our relative exposure 

to variability in the future cash flows and performance of the VIE.
Total assets in these VIEs and our maximum exposure to losses 
are summarized in the following table, with the exception of our 

compensation trusts, which are described in further detail below.

Securities held in our bank securitization vehicles are comprised of $105 million of asset-backed 

commercial paper classified as trading securities ($55 million in 2009), and $261 million of

Customer Securitization Vehicles
We sponsor customer securitization vehicles (also referred to as 

bank-sponsored multi-seller conduits) that assist our customers with 

the securitization of their assets to provide them with alternate sources 

of funding. These vehicles provide clients with access to financing in 

the asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) markets by allowing them 
to sell their assets into these vehicles, which then issue ABCP to investors
 to fund the purchases. 
In all cases, we do not service the transferred 
assets. If there are losses on the asse
ts, the seller is the first to take 
the loss. We do not sell assets to or service the assets held by these 
customer securitization vehicles. We earn fees for providing services 

related to the securitizations, including liquidity, distribution and 

financial arrangement fees for supporting the ongoing operations 

of the vehicles.
Canadian Customer Securitization Vehicles
Our exposure to our Canadian customer securitization vehicles is 

summarized in the table above. We purchase ABCP through our role 

as a market maker and hold these securities for an interim period 

until investors purchase them. In ge
neral, investors in the ABCP have 
recourse only to the assets of the related VIE and do not have recourse 

to us. To the extent that we have
 purchased ABCP, 
our exposure under 
the liquidity facilities is reduced by an equal amount. We use our 

credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter into global style 

backstop liquidity facilities just as we do when extending credit in the 

form of a loan. The vehicles have never drawn on these facilities to date.
We assess whether we are required to consolidate these vehicles 
based on a quantitative analysis of expected losses that could be absorbed
 by us. In doing this analysis, we consider our significant variable
 interests, 
primarily our holdings of ABCP, as well as fees earned for services 
provided. We consolidate VIEs that are fully financed by us through 

our ownership of ABCP. We are not required to consolidate five of our 
eight Canadian customer securitization vehicles. Our exposure to loss 

is limited to the consolidated assets disclosed in the preceding table.
  customer securitization vehicles are comprised of asset-backed commercial paper and are 

classified as trading securities. Assets held by all these vehicles relate to assets in Canada.
(4)  
Derivatives held with this vehicle are classified as trading instruments. Changes in the fair 

value of these derivatives are offset by derivatives held with third-party counterparties that 

are also classified as trading instruments.
(5)  
Securities held are classified as trading securities and have a face value of $1,415 million. 

Our exposure to these securities has been hedged through derivatives.

U.S. Customer Securitization Vehicle
Our exposure to our U.S. customer securitization vehicle is summarized 
in the preceding table. As part of ou
r services in support of the ongoing 
operations of the vehicle, we may advance funds under backstop 

liquidity facilities. We use our credit adjudication process in deciding 

whether to do so just as we do when extending credit in the form 
of 
a loan. During the year ended October 31, 2010, we provided funding 

of $310 million (US$304 million) in accordance with the terms of these 
liquidity facilities, of which $179 million (US$176 million) was outstanding
 as at October 31, 2010. The amount outstanding related to funding 

advanced in years prior to 2010 was $72 million (US$71 million) as at 
October 31, 2010. These amounts are included in the preceding table.
We assess whether we are required to consolidate this vehicle 
based on a quantitative analysis of expected losses that could be absorbed 
by us. In doing this analysis, we consider our significant variable interests, 
primarily the backstop liquidity facilities, as well as fees for services 

we provide. We are not required to consolidate our U.S. customer securi-

tization vehicle.
Bank Securitization Vehicles
We use bank securitization vehicles to securitize our Canadian mortgage
 loans and Canadian credit card loans in order to obtain alternate sources
 of funding. The structure of these vehicles limits the types of activities 

they can undertake and the types of assets they can hold, and they have 

limited decision-making authority. These vehicles issue ABCP or term 

asset-backed securities to fund their activities.
We are not required to consolidate our bank securitization
 vehicles based on the structure of these vehicles. More information 

on our invest 
ments, rights and obligations related to these vehicles 
can be found in Note 8. Our variable interests in these vehicles are 

summarized in the preceding table. Derivative contracts entered into 

with these vehicles enable the vehicles to manage their exposure 

to interest rate fluctuations.
We provide global style backstop liquidity facilities to some of our 
bank securitization vehicles that have objective criteria for determining 
when they can be drawn upon. We use our credit adjudication process 

in deciding whether to enter into these agreements just as we do when 

extending credit in the form of a loan. 
Credit Protection Vehicle
We sponsor a credit protection vehicle, Apex Trust (“Apex”), that 

provides credit protection to investors on investments in corporate 

debt portfolios through credit default swaps. In May 2008, upon 

the restructuring of Apex, we entered into credit default swaps with 

swap counterparties and offsetting swaps with Apex. Since the swaps 

are classified as trading instruments and have similar terms, changes 
in the fair value of the swaps held with Apex are offset by changes in 
the fair value of the swaps held with the swap counterparties. The fair 
value of the swaps with Apex is included in the preceding table along 

with our holdings of notes issued by Apex and a senior funding facility. 

As at October 31, 2010, we have hedged our exposure to our holdings 

of notes as well as the first $515 
million of exposure under the senior 
funding facility. Since 2008, a third party has held its exposure to Apex 
through a total return swap with us on $600 million of notes.
We assess whether we are required to consolidate this vehicle based
 on a quantitative analysis of expected losses that could be absorbed 
by us. In doing this analysis, we consider our net exposure from significant
 variable interests in Apex, primarily securities issued by Apex and the 

senior funding facility we provide and their related hedges. We are not 

required to consolidate Apex.
Structured Investment Vehicles
Structured investment vehicles (“SIVs”) provide investment opportunities 

in customized, diversified debt portfolios in a variety of asset and 

rating classes. We hold interests in two SIVs, Links Finance Corporation 
(“Links”) and Parkland Finance Corporation (“Parkland”), and act 

as asset manager. Our exposure to loss is summarized in the table 

above. We provide senior-ranked su
pport for the funding of Links and 
Parkland through our liquidity facilities. The facilities permit the SIVs 

to continue the strategy of selling assets in an orderly manner. Other 
than our current commitment, which is included in the preceding 

table, we are not obligated to provide additional facilities to the SIVs. 
We use our credit adjudication process in deciding whether to do so 

just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan.
We assess whether we are required to consolidate these vehicles 
based on a quantitative analysis of expected losses that could be 
absorbed by us. In doing this analysis, we consider our significant 

variable
 interests in the vehicles through our liquidity facilities and our 
holdings of capital notes. We are not required to consolidate these VIEs.
Structured Finance Vehicles
We facilitate development of investment products by third parties, 

including mutual funds, unit investment trusts and other investment 

funds that are sold to retail investors. We enter into derivatives 

with these funds to provide the inve
stors their desired exposure, and 
we hedge our exposure related to these derivatives by investing in 

other funds. We consolidate those VIEs in which our interests expose us 

to a majority of the expected losses or residual returns, or both, unless 

the exposure to expected losses and residual returns has been passed 

on to the retail investor through the derivative arrangement. We base 

this assessment on our holdings of units issued by these VIEs. Our 

exposure to loss from non-consolidat
ed VIEs is limited to the amount 
of our investment.
Capital and Funding Trusts
BMO Capital Trust II (“Trust II”) was created in 2009 to issue $450 million 

of BMO Tier 1 Notes 
Œ Series A. Trust II used the proceeds of the offering 
to purchase a senior deposit note from us. We are not required to 
con 
solidate Trust II based on our assessment of our variable interests. 
See Note 18 for further infor 
mation related to Trust II. 
BMO Covered Bond Trust (“CB Trust”) was created in 2007 to 
guarantee payments due to the bondholders in respect of 
€1 billion and 
US$2 billion of BMO Covered Bonds we have since issued. We sell assets 

to CB Trust in exchange for a promissory note. The assets of CB Trust 

have been pledged to secure payment of the bonds we issued. CB Trust 

is a VIE that we are required to consolidate as we are exposed to the 

majority of its expected losses and residual returns, based on our 

assessment of our variable interests.
BMO Subordinated Notes Trust (“SN Trust”) was created in 2007 to 
issue $800 million of BMO Trust Subordinated Notes 
Œ Series A. SN Trust 
used the proceeds of the offering to 
purchase a senior deposit note from 
us. We are not required to consolidate SN Trust based on our assessment 

of our variable interests. See Note 17 for further information related 

to SN Trust.
BMO Capital Trust (the “Trust”) was created to issue BMO Capital 
Trust Securities (“BMO BOaTS”). The Trust is a VIE that we are required to 

consolidate based on our assessment of our variable interests. Securities 

outstanding as at October 31, 2010 were $1.9 billion ($2.2 billion as at 

October 31, 2009), and are reported as either non-controlling interest or 

capital trust securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 18 

for further information related to the Trust.
Compensation Trusts
We have established trusts in order to administer our employee 

share ownership plan. Under this plan, we match 50% of employees’ 

contributions when they choose to contribute a portion of their gross 

salary toward the purchase of our common shares. Our matching 

contributions are paid into trusts, whic
h purchase our shar
es on the open 
market for distribution to employees once employees are entitled to 

the shares under the t
erms of the plan. Total assets held by our 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

130
 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
compensation trusts amounted to $1,021 million as at October 31, 2010 
($869 million in 2009). Based on our assessment of variable interests, 

we are not required to consolidate these compensation trusts and 

we have no exposure to loss related to these trusts.
Other VIEs
We are involved with other entities that may potentially be VIEs. 

This involvement can include, for example, acting as a derivatives 

counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, fund manager or trustee. 

These activities do not cause us to be exposed to a majority of 
the expected losses of these VIEs or allow us to benefit from a majority 

of their expected residual returns. As a result, we are not required to 

consolidate these VIEs. Transactions with these VIEs are conducted at 

market rates, and individual creditor investment decisions are based 
upon the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality
 of underlying assets. We record and report these transactions in the 
same manner as other transactions. For example, derivative contracts 
are recorded in accordance with our derivatives accounting policy as 

outlined in Note 10. Liquidity facilities are described in Note 7.
Note 10: Derivative Instruments
Derivative instruments are financial contracts that derive their value 

from underlying changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or 

other financial or commodity prices or indices.
Derivative instruments are either regulated exchange-traded 
contracts or negotiated over-the-counter contracts. We use these 

instruments for trading purposes, as well as to manage our exposures, 

mainly to currency and interest rate fluctuations, as part of our asset/ 

liability management program.
Types of Derivatives
Swaps
Swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange 

a series of cash flows. The various sw
ap agreements that we enter into 
are as follows:
Interest rate swaps 
Œ counterparties generally exchange fixed 
and floating rate interest payments based on a notional value in 

a single currency.
Cross-currency swaps 
Œ fixed rate interest payments and principal 
amounts are exchanged in different currencies.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps 
Œ fixed and floating rate interest 
payments and principal amounts are exchanged in different currencies.
Commodity swaps 
Œ counterparties generally exchange fixed and 
floating rate payments based on a notional value of a single commodity.
Equity swaps 
Œ counterparties exchange the return on an equity 
security or a group of equity securit
ies for the return based on a fixed 
or floating interest rate or the return on another equity security or group 

of equity securities.
Credit default swaps 
Œ one counterparty pays the other a fee 
in exchange for that other counterparty agreeing to make a payment 

if a credit event occurs, such as bankruptcy or failure to pay.
Total return swaps 
Œ one counterparty agrees to pay or receive 
from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a 

reference asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest 

earned on these assets, in exchange for amounts that are based on 

prevailing market funding rates.
The main risks associated with these instruments are related to 
exposure to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit 

quality, securities values or commodities prices, as applicable, and the 

possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts.
Forwards and Futures
Forwards and futures are contractual agreements to either buy or sell 

a specified amount of a currency, commodity, interest-rate-sensitive 

financial instrument or security at 
a specific price and da
te in the future.
Forwards are customized contracts transacted in the over-the-
counter market. Futures are transacted in standardized amounts on 

regulated exchanges and are subject to daily cash margining.
The main risks associated with these instruments arise from the 
possible inability of over-the-counter counterparties to meet the terms 

of the contracts and from movements in commodities prices, securities 

values, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as applicable.
Options
Options are contractual agreements that convey to the purchaser 

the right but not the obligation to either buy or sell a specified 

amount of a currency, commodity, interest-rate-sensitive financial 

instrument or security at a fixed future date or at any time within 

a fixed future period.
For options written by us, we receive a premium from the 
purchaser for accepting market risk.
For options purchased by us, we pay a premium for the right to 
exercise the option. Since we have no obligation to exercise the option, 

our primary exposures to risk are the ability to hedge the market risk 

in a manner which allows us to recover the premium paid and the credit 

risk if the writer of an over-the-counter contract fails to meet the terms 

of the contract.
Caps, collars and floors are specialized types of written and 
purchased options. They are contractual agreements in which the 
writer agrees to pay the purchaser, based on a specified notional 

amount, the difference between t
he market rate and the prescribed 
rate of the cap, collar or floor. The writer receives a premium for 

selling this instrument.
Uses of Derivatives
Trading Derivatives
Trading derivatives include derivatives entered into with customers 

to accommodate their risk management needs, derivatives transacted 

to generate trading income from our own proprietary trading positions 

and certain derivatives that do not qualify as hedges for accounting 

purposes (“economic hedges”).
We structure and market derivative products to enable customers 
to transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. 
Proprietary activities include market-making, positioning and 
arbitrage activities. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices 

to other market participants with the intention of generating revenues 

based on spread and volume. Positioning activities involve managing 

market risk positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable 

movements in prices, rates or indices. Arbitrage activities involve 

identifying and profiting from price 
differentials between markets 
and products.
We may also take proprietary trading positions in various capital 
market instruments and derivatives that, taken together, are designed 

to profit from anticipated changes in market conditions.
Trading derivatives are marked to fair value. Realized and unrealized
 gains and losses are recorded in trading revenues (losses) in our 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Unrealized gains on trading derivatives
 are recorded as derivative instrument assets and unrealized losses 
are recorded as derivative instrument liabilities in our Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. 
Hedging Derivatives
In accordance with our asset/liability management strategy, we enter 
into various derivative contracts to hedge our interest rate and foreign 
currency exposures.
Notes
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
 131
Risks Hedged
Interest Rate Risk
We manage interest rate risk through interest rate swaps and options, 
which are linked to and adjust the interest rate sensitivity of a spe-

cific asset, liability, forecasted transaction or firm commitment, or a 

specific pool of transactions with similar risk characteristics.
Foreign Currency Risk
We manage foreign currency risk through cross-currency swaps and 
forward contracts. These derivatives are marked to 
fair value
, with 
realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in non-interest revenue, 
consistent with the accounting treatment for gains and losses on the 

economically hedged item. Changes in fair value on forward contracts 

that qualify as accounting hedges are recorded in other comprehensive 

income, with the spot/forward differential (the difference between 

the foreign currency rate at inception of the contract and the rate at the 

end of the contract) being recorded in interest expense over the term 

of the hedge.
We also sometimes economically hedge U.S. dollar earnings through 
forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize fluctuations in our 
Canadian dollar earnings due to the translation of our U.S. dollar earnings. 

These contracts are marked to fair value, with gains and losses recorded 

as non-interest revenue in foreign exchange, other than trading.
Accounting Hedges
In order for a derivative to qualify as an accounting hedge, the 

hedging relationship must be designated and formally documented 

at its inception, detailing the particular risk management objective 

and strategy for the hedge and the specific asset, liability or cash flow 

being hedged, as well as how its effectiveness is being assessed. 

Changes in the fair value of the derivative must be highly effective 

in offsetting either changes in the fair value of on-balance sheet 

items caused by the risk being hedged or changes in the amount 

of future cash flows.
Hedge effectiveness is evaluated at the inception of the hedging 
relationship and on an ongoing basis, retrospectively and prospectively, 

primarily using quantitative statistical measures of correlation. Any 

ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recognized in non-interest 

revenue, other in our Consolidated Statement of Income as it arises.
Cash Flow Hedges
Cash flow hedges modify exposure to variability in cash flows for 

variable rate interest bearing instruments and assets denominated in 

foreign currencies. Our cash flow hedges, which have a maximum 

remaining term to maturity of seven years, are hedges of floating rate 

loans and deposits as well as assets denominated in foreign currencies.
We record interest that we pay or receive on the derivative as an 
adjustment to interest, dividend and fee income in our Consolidated 

Statement of Income over the life of the hedge.
To the extent that changes in the fair value of the derivative offset 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item, they are recorded in other 

comprehensive income. Any portion of the change in fair value of the 

derivative that does not offset changes in the fair value of the hedged 
item (the “ineffectiveness of the hedge”) is recorded directly in 

non-interest revenue, other in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
For cash flow hedges that are discontinued before the end of 
the original hedge term, the unrealized gain or loss recorded in other 

comprehensive income is amortized to interest, dividend and fee 

income or interest expense, as applicable, in our Consolidated Statement 

of Income as the hedged item affects earnings. If the hedged item 
is sold or settled, the entire unrealized gain or loss is recognized in 
interest, dividend and fee income or interest expense, as applicable, 

in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The amount of unrealized gain 
that we expect to reclassify to our Consolidated Statement of Income 
over the next 12 months is $138 million ($96 million after tax). This will 

adjust interest on assets and liabilities that were hedged.
Fair Value Hedges
Fair value hedges modify exposure to changes in a fixed rate instru-

ment’s
 fair value caused by changes in interest rates. These hedges 
convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to floating rate. Our fair value 

hedges include hedges of fixed rate securities, deposits and subordi-

nated debt.
We record interest receivable or payable on the derivative as 
an adjustment to net interest income in our Consolidated Statement 

of Income over the life of the hedge.
For fair value hedges, not only is the hedging derivative recorded 
at fair value but fixed rate assets and liabilities that are part of a hedging 

relationship are adjusted for the changes in value of the risk being 

hedged (“quasi fair value”). To the extent that the change in the fair 

value of the derivative does not offset changes in the quasi fair value 

of the hedged item (the “ineffective
ness of the hedge”), the net 
amount is recorded directly in non-interest revenue, other in our 

Consolidated Statement of Income.
For fair value hedges that are discontinued, we cease adjusting 
the hedged item to quasi fair value. The quasi fair value adjustment 

of the hedged item is then amortized as an adjustment to the interest 

income/expense on the hedged item over its remaining term to 

maturity. If the hedged item is sold or settled, any remaining quasi fair 

value adjustment is included in the determination of the gain or loss 

on sale or settlement. We did not hedge any commitments during the 

years ended October 31, 2010 and 2009. 
Net Investment Hedges
Net investment hedges mitigate our exposure to foreign currency 
fluctuations in our net investment in foreign operations. Deposit liabilities
 denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of this 
exposure. The foreign currency translation of both the net investment and
 hedge is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

on Translation of Net Foreign Operations. To the extent that the hedge 

is not effective, amounts are included in the Consolidated Statement of 

Income in foreign exchange, other than trading. The amount of hedge 

ineffectiveness associated with net investment hedges for the year 

ended October 31, 2010 was a gain of $4 million (gain of $10 million 

in 2009 and loss of $11 million in 2008).

From time to time, we purchase or 
issue financial instruments contain-
ing embedded derivatives. The embedded derivative is separated from 
the host contract and carried at fair value if the economic characteristics 

of the derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, 

the terms of the embedded derivative are the same as those of a 

stand-alone derivative, and the combined contract is not held for trading 

or designated at fair value. To the extent that we cannot reliably identify 

and measure the embedded derivative, the entire contract is carried 

at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Embedded 

derivatives in certain of our equity linked notes are accounted for 

separately from the host instrument.
Contingent Features
Certain over-the-counter derivative instruments contain provisions 

that link how much collateral we are required to post or payment 
requirements to our credit ratings 
(as determined by the major credit 
rating agencies). If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, certain 

counterparties to the derivative instruments could demand immediate 

and ongoing collateralization overnight on derivative liability positions 

or request immediate payment. The aggregate fair value of all 
derivative instruments with collateral posting requirements that are in 

a liability position on October 31, 2010 is $7.3 billion, for which we have 

posted collateral of $6.5 billion. If our credit rating had been downgraded 

to A– on October 31, 2010 (per Standard & Poor’s Rating Services), we 

would have been required to post collateral or meet payment demands 

of an additional $1,082 million.
Fair Value
Fair value represents point-in-time estimates that may change 

in subsequent reporting periods due to market conditions or other 

factors. Fair value for exchange-traded derivatives is considered to 

be the price quoted on derivatives exchanges. Fair value for over-
the-counter derivatives is determined using multi-contributor prices 

or zero coupon valuation techniques further adjusted for credit, 
model and liquidity risks, as well as administration costs. Zero coupon 

curves are created using generally accepted valuation techniques 
from underlying instruments such
 as cash, bonds and futures 
observable in the market. Option implied volatilities, an input into 
the valuation model, are either obtained directly from market 
sources or calculated from market prices.

Notional Amounts
The notional amounts of our derivatives represent the amount to
 which a rate or price is applied in order to calculate the amou
nt of cash that must be 
exchanged under the contract. Notional amounts do not represent asse
ts or liabilities and therefore are not recorded in our Con
solidated Balance Sheet.

Derivative-Related Market Risk
Derivative instruments are subject to market risk. Market risk arises 
from the potential for a negative impact on the balance sheet and/or 

income statement resulting from adverse changes in the value of 

derivative instruments as a result of changes in certain market variables. 

These variables include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices and their implied volatilities, as well as credit spreads, 
credit migration and default. We strive to limit market risk by employing 

comprehensive governance and management processes for all market 

risk-taking activities.
Derivative-Related Credit Risk
Over-the-counter derivative instruments are subject to credit risk 

arising from the possibility that counterparties may default on their 

obligations. The credit risk associated with derivatives is normally 

a small fraction of the notional amount of the derivative instrument. 

Derivative contracts generally expose us to potential credit loss if 

changes in market rates affect a counterparty’s position unfavourably 

and the counterparty defaults on payment. The credit risk is 

represented by the positive fair value of the derivative instrument. 

We strive to limit credit risk by dealing with counterparties that we 

believe are creditworthy, and we manage our credit risk for derivatives 

using the same credit risk process that is applied to loans and other 

credit assets.

 The total derivatives and impact of master netting agreements for replacement cost do not include exchange-traded derivatives 
with a fair value of $1,842 million as at October 31, 2010 ($1,881 million in 2009).
Transactions are conducted with counterparties in various geographic loca
tions and industries. Set out below is the replacement
 cost of contracts 
(before the impact of master netting agreements) with customers loca
ted in the following countries, based on country of ultimat
e risk:

47,917 100% 46,017 100% (1) No other country represented 10% or more of our replacement cost in 2010 or 2009.
We also pursue opportunities to reduce our exposure to credit 
losses on derivative instruments, including entering into collateral agree-
ments and entering into master netting agreements with counter 
parties. 
The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is eliminated by 
master netting agreements to the extent that unfavourable contracts with 
the same counterparty cannot be settled before favourable contracts.
Exchange-traded derivatives have no potential for credit exposure 
as they are settled net with each exchange.
 Terms used in the credit risk table below are as follows:
Replacement cost 
represents the cost of replacing all contracts that 
have a positive fair value, using current market rates. It represents 
in effect the unrealized gains on our derivative instruments. Replacement
 costs disclosed below represent the net of the asset and liability to a 
specific counterparty where we have a legally enforceable right to offset 

the amount owed to us with the am
ount owed by us and we intend 
either to settle on a net basis or 
to realize the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
Credit risk equivalent 
represents the total replacement cost plus 
an amount representing the potential future credit exposure, as outlined 
in OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Guideline.
Risk-weighted assets 
represent the credit risk equivalent, weighted 
based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, as prescribed by OSFI.

We account for acquisitions of busin
esses using the purchase method. 
This involves allocating the purchase price paid for a business to the 
assets acquired, including identifi

liabilities assumed based on their fair

Any excess is then recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of 
acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial state-
ments beginning on the date of acquisition.
AMCORE Bank, N.A. (“AMCORE”)
On April 23, 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and 

liabilities of AMCORE from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(“FDIC”) for total consideration of $253 million (US$245 million), subject 

to a post-closing adjustment based on net assets. During the year 

ended October 31, 2010, we reduced the purchase price by $28 million 

(US$23 million) to $225 million (US$222 million) based on a revaluation 

of the net assets acquired. Under 
the terms of the acquisition, the 
FDIC absorbs 80% of the losses on the acquired loans. The acquisition 
of AMCORE accelerates our growth strategy and reinforces our already 

strong position in the U.S. Midwest by expanding our presence in 

Illinois and Wisconsin. As part of this acquisition, we acquired a core 

deposit intangible asset that is being amortized on an accelerated 

basis over 10 years. All intangibles, including goodwill, related to this 

acquisition are deductible for tax purposes. The acquired assets and 

liabilities are included in our Personal and Commercial Banking U.S. 

reporting segment. 
Note 11: Premises and Equipment
We record all premises and equipment at cost less accumulated 

amortization, except land, which is recorded at cost. Buildings, computer 

equipment and operating system software, other equipment and 

leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their 

estimated useful lives. The maximum 
estimated useful lives we use to 
amortize our assets are:
Buildings 40 
years
Computer equipment and operating system software 
15 years
Other equipment

respectively).
Gains and losses on disposal are included in other non-interest 
revenue in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
We test premises and equipment for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not 

be recoverable. We write them down to fair value when the related 

undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value. There were no 

significant write-downs of premises 
and equipment du
e to impairment 
during the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
Lease Commitments
We have entered into a number of non-cancellable leases for premises 

and equipment. Our total contractual rental commitments as at Octo 
-ber 31, 2010 were $1,520 million. The commitments for each of the next 

five years and thereafter are $249 million for 2011, $221 million for 2012, 

$189 million for 2013, $143 million for 2014, $125 million for 2015 and 

$593 million thereafter. Included in these amounts are the commitments 

related to 688 leased branch locations as at October 31, 2010.
Net rent expense for premises and equipment reported in our Con-
solidated Statement of Income for the years ended October 31, 2010, 
2009 
and 2008 was $340 million, $340 million and $326 million, respectively.
Diners Club
On December 31, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the net card-
holder receivables of the Diners Club North American franchise from 

Citigroup for total cash consideration of $882 million (US$839 million), 
subject to a post-closing adjustment based on net assets. During the year
 ended October 31, 2010, we reduced t
he purchase price by $44 million 
(US$41 million) to $838 million (US$798 million) based on a revaluation of
 the net assets acquired. The acquisition of the net cardholder receivables 

of Diners Club gives us the right to issue Diners Club cards to corporate 

and professional clients in the United States and Canada and will 

accelerate our initiative to expand in the travel and entertainment card 

sector for commercial customers across North America. As part of this 

acquisition, we acquired a customer relationship intangible asset that is 

being amortized on an accelerated basis over 15 years and a computer 

software intangible asset that is being amortized on a straight-line basis 

over five years. Goodwill related to this acquisition is deductible for tax 

purposes. Diners Club is part of our Personal and Commercial Banking 

Canada reporting segment.
Paloma Securities L.L.C. (“Paloma”)
On December 13, 2009, we completed the acquisition of selected assets 

used in the securities lending business of Paloma for cash consideration 
of $7 million (US$6 million) and hired its global securities lending 
team. The acquisition provides us with the opportunity to expand our 
securities lending operation. Goodwill related to this acquisition is 
deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition is part of our BMO Capital 

Markets reporting segment.

AIG Life Insurance Company of Canada
(“BMO Life Assurance”)
On April 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding voting 
shares of AIG Life Insurance Company of Canada for cash consideration 

of $330 million, subject to a post-closing adjustment based on net 

assets. The post-closing adjustment was finalized during 2010 and the 

purchase price was reduced to $278 million. The acquisition of BMO 

Life Assurance enables us to provide our clients with a wider range of 

investment, financial planning and insurance solutions. As part of this 

acquisition, we acquired a customer relationship intangible asset that is 

being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years, a non-compete 

agreement that is being amortized on a straight-line basis over two 

years and a computer software intangible asset that is being amortized 

on a straight-line basis over five years. Goodwill related to this 

acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. BMO Life Assurance 

is part of our Private Client Group reporting segment.
Goodwill
When we acquire a subsidiary, joint venture or securities over which 

we exert significant influence and account for the acquisition using 

the equity method, we allocate the purchase price paid to the assets 

acquired, including identifiable inta
ngible assets, and the liabilities 
assumed. Any excess of the amount
 paid over the fair value of those 
net assets is considered to be goodwill.
Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is tested for impairment 
at least annually. The impairment test consists of allocating goodwill 

to our reporting units (groups of businesses with similar characteristics) 

and then comparing the book value of the reporting units, including 

goodwill, to their fair values. We determine fair value primarily using 

discounted cash flows. The excess of carrying value of goodwill over 

fair value of goodwill, if any, is recorded as an impairment charge in 

the period in which impairment is determined.
There were no write-downs of goodwill due to impairment during 
the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

 Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.
Intangible assets are amortized to income over the period during 
which we believe the assets will benefit us on either a straight-line or 

an accelerated basis, over a period not to exceed 15 years. We have no 

significant intangible assets with indefinite lives. The weighted-average 
amortization period for customer relationships is 10 years, core 
deposits 11 years, branch distribution networks 15 years, purchased 

and developed software 5 years and other 6 years.
The aggregate amount of intangible
 assets acquired during the years
 ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $370 million, $199 million 

and $244 million, respectively.

A portion of our structured note liabilities are designated as trading 
under the fair value option and are accounted for at fair value, which 

better aligns the accounting result with the way the portfolio is 

managed. The change in fair value of these structured notes was a 

decrease in non-interest revenue, trading revenues of $110 million 

for the year ended October 31, 2010 (increase of $53 million in 2009), 

including an increase of $13 million attributable to changes in our 

credit spread (charge of $158 million in 2009). We recognized offsetting 

amounts on derivatives and other financial instrument contracts that 

are held to hedge changes in the fair value of these structured notes.

recorded at their market value. Adjustments to the market value as at 

the balance sheet date and gains and losses on the settlement of these 

obligations are recorded in trading revenues (losses) in our Consolidated 

Statement of Income.
Securities Lent or Sold Under Repurchase Agreements
Securities lent or sold under repurc
hase agreements represent short-term
 funding transactions in which we sell securities that we own and 
simultaneously commit to repurchase
 the same securities at a specified 
price on a specified date in the future. The obligation to repurchase 

these securities is recorded at the amount owing. The interest expense 

related to these liabilities is recorded on an accrual basis.

preferred shares of US$250 million (US$250 million in 2009) issued by 

Harris Preferred Capital Corporation, a U.S. subsidiary, that forms part 

of our Tier 1 regulatory capital. 
Insurance-Related Liabilities
We are engaged in insurance businesses related to life and health 

insurance, annuities products and reinsurance.
Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current 
claims and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for 

life insurance contracts are determi
ned using the Canadian Asset Liability 
Method, which incorporates best-estimate assumptions for mortality, 

morbidity, policy lapses, surrenders, investment yields, policy dividends, 

administration costs and margins for adverse deviation. These assump-

tions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual 

experience and market conditions. Insurance claims and policy benefit 

liabilities are included in Other liabilities 
Œ Insurance-related liabilities. 
The effect of changes in actuarial assumptions on policy benefit liabilities 

was not material during either 2009 or 2010. 
Reinsurance
In the ordinary course of business, our insurance subsidiaries reinsure 

risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies in order to provide 
greater diversification, limit loss exposure to large risks and provide 

additional capacity for future growth. These ceding reinsurance 
arrangements do not relieve our insurance subsidiaries from their direct 

obligation to the insureds. We evaluate the financial condition of the 

reinsurers and monitor their credit 
ratings to minimize our exposure 
to losses from reinsurer insolvency.
Reinsurance recoverables related 
to our life insurance business 
are included in Other liabilities 
Œ Insurance-related liabilities to offset 

the related liabilities. Insurance-related liabilities are net of ceded 

reinsurance of $872 million in 2010 ($758 million in 2009).
Reinsurance amounts included in non-interest revenue, insurance 
income in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended 

October 31 are shown in the table below.

The change in fair value related to changes in our credit

as held for trading to October 31, 2010 was an unrealized loss of 

$29 million. Starting in 2009, we hedged the exposure to changes 

in our credit spread.
The fair value and amount due at contractual maturity 
of these notes as at October 31, 2010 were $3,976 million and 

$4,084 million, respectively ($3,073 million and $3,377 million,

Note 18: Capital Trust Securities
We issue BMO Capital Trust Securities (“BMO BOaTS”) through our 
consolidated subsidiary BMO Capital Trust (the “Trust”). The proceeds 
of the BMO BOaTS are used to purchase mortgages. We consolidate 

the Trust, and the BMO BOaTS are reported in our Consolidated Balance 

Sheet either as non-controlling interest in subsidiaries or as capital 

trust securities, depending on the terms of the BMO BOaTS.
During the year ended October 31, 2009, we issued $450 million of 
BMO Tier 1 Notes 
Œ Series A (“BMO T1Ns – Series A”) through BMO Capital
 Trust II (“Trust II”). Trust II is a variable interest entity which we are not 

required to consolidate (see Note 9); therefore, the BMO T1Ns 
Œ Series A 
issued by Trust II are not reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Trust II used the proceeds of the issu
ance to purchase a senior deposit 
note from us which is reported as a business and government deposit 

liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The BMO T1Ns 
Œ Series A 
are redeemable, at the option of Trust II, subject to certain conditions 

on or after December 31, 2013. In certain circumstances, the BMO T1Ns 
Œ Series A may be automatically exchanged for, or interest payable 
thereon may be paid by, the issuance of Class B non-cumulative preferred
 shares of Bank of Montreal. The senior deposit note we issued to Trust II 
bears interest at an annual rate of 10.421%, which will be reset on 
December 31, 2018 and on every fifth anniversary of that date thereafter 

until December 31, 2103. BMO T1Ns 
Œ Series A and the senior deposit 

note will mature on December 31, 2107.
Holders of the BMO BOaTS and BMO T1Ns 
Œ Series A are entitled 
to receive semi-annual fixed cash distributions as long as we declare 

dividends on our preferred shares or
, if no such shares are outstanding, 
on our common shares in accordance with our ordinary dividend practice.
Subordinated debt represents our direct unsecured obligations, in the 

form of notes and debentures, to our debt holders and forms part of our 

regulatory capital. The rights of the holders of our notes and debentures 

are subordinate to the claims of depositors and certain other creditors. 

We require approval from OSFI before we can redeem any part of our 

subordinated debt. Where appropriate, 
we enter into 
fair value hedges 
to hedge the risks caused by changes in interest rates (see Note 10).
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we redeemed all of 
our 4.00% Series C Medium-Term Notes, Tranche 1, due 2015, totalling 

$500 million. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 

100% of the principal amount plus 
unpaid accrued interest to the 

redemption date.
During the year ended October 31, 2009, our $140 million 10.85% 
Debentures, Series 12 matured.
During the year ended October 31, 2008, we issued Series F 
Medium-Term Notes, Tranche 1, totalling $900 million. We redeemed all 

of our 5.75% Series A Medium-Term Notes, Tranche 2, due 2013, totalling 

$150 million. The notes were redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of 

the principal amount plus unpaid accru
ed interest to the redemption date. 
We have issued $800 million of innovative subordinated debentures,
 BMO Trust Subordinated Notes (“BMO TSNs 
Œ Series A”) through BMO 
Subordinated Notes Trust (“SN Trust”). SN Trust is a variable interest 

entity which we are not required to consolidate (see Note 9); therefore, 

the BMO TSNs 
Œ Series A issued by SN Trust are not reported in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. SN Trust used the proceeds of the issuance 

to purchase a senior deposit note from us which is reported as a business
 and government deposit liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

All of the BMO TSNs 
Œ Series A will be exchanged automatically, without 
the consent of the holders, into 
our Series E Subordinated Notes upon 
the occurrence of specific events, such as a wind-up of Bank of Montreal, 

a regulatory requirement to increase capital, violations of regulatory 

capital requirements or changes to tax legislation.
We have guaranteed the payments of principal, interest and 
redemption price, if any, and an
y other amounts on the BMO TSNs 
Œ Series A when they become due and payable. This guarantee is 

subordinate to our deposit liabilities 
and all other liabilities, except for 
other guarantees, obligations or liabilities that are designated as ranking 

either equally with or subordinate 
to the subordinated indebtedness.
The senior deposit note we issued to SN Trust bears interest at an 
annual rate of 5.90% and will mature on September 26, 2022. 
 (6)  
Redeemable at the greater of par and the Ca
nada Yield Price prior to September 26, 2017,
and redeemable at par commencing September 26, 2017.
 (7)  
Certain subordinated debt recorded amounts include quasi fair value adjustments that 

increase their carrying value by $226 million ($186 million in 2009) as they are part of 

fair value hedges (see Note 10).
 (8)  
All of our subordinated debt has a term to maturity of over five years.

We earn interest on interest bearing assets and we pay interest on 

interest bearing liabilities. We also have derivative instruments, such 

as interest rate swaps and interest rate options, whose values are 

sensitive to changes in interest rates. To the extent that we have assets, 

liabilities and derivative instruments maturing or repricing at different 

points in time, we are exposed to interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Gap Position
The determination of the interest rate sensitivity or gap position by 

necessity encompasses numerous assumptions. It is based on the earlier 

of the repricing date or maturity date of assets, liabilities and derivatives 

used to manage interest rate risk.
The gap position presented is as at October 31 of each year. 
It represents the position outstanding at the close of the business 

day and may change significantly in subsequent periods based 

on customer behaviour and the application of our asset and liability 

management policies. 
The assumptions for the year ended October 31, 2010 were as follows:
Assets
Fixed rate, fixed term assets, such as residential mortgage loans and 
consumer loans, are reported based upon the scheduled repayments and 
estimated prepayments that reflect expected borrower behaviour.
Conversion by the Holders
On or after the conversion dates indicated above, the BMO BOaTS Series B 
and C may be exchanged for our Class B Preferred shares, Series 8 

and 9, respectively, at the option of the holders. BMO BOaTS Series D, E 

and BMO T1Ns cannot be converted at the option of the holder. 
Automatic Exchange
The BMO BOaTS Series B, C, D, E and BMO T1Ns will each be automatically
 exchanged for 40 of our Class B Preferred shares, Series 8, 9, 11, 12 and 

20, respectively, without the consent of the holders on the occurrence 
of specific events, such as a wind-up of Bank of Montreal, a regulatory 
requirement to increase capital or violations of regulatory capital 

requirements.
Note 19: Interest Rate Risk
Trading and underwriting (mark-to-market) assets and interest 
bearing assets on which the customer interest rate changes with the 

prime rate or other short-term market rates are reported in the zero to 

three months category.
Goodwill and intangible and fixed assets are reported as non-interest
 sensitive. Other fixed rate and non-interest bearing assets with no 

defined maturity are reported based on an assumed maturity profile 

that considers historical and forecasted trends in balances. 
LiabilitiesFixed rate, fixed term liabilities, such as investment certificates, are 

reported at scheduled maturity with estimated redemptions that reflect 

expected depositor behaviour. 
Interest bearing deposits on which the customer interest rate 
changes with the prime rate or other short-term market rates are 

reported in the zero to three months category. 
Fixed rate and non-interest bearing liabilities with no defined 
maturity are reported based on an assumed maturity profile that 

considers historical and forecasted trends in balances. 
Capital
Common shareholders’ equity is r
eported as non-interest sensitive.
YieldsYields are based upon the effective interest rates for the assets or 

liabilities on October 31, 2010.
 (4)  
Starting on December 31, 2018 and on every fifth anniversary of such date thereafter until 

December 31, 2103, the interest rate on the BMO Tier 1 Notes 
Œ Series A will be reset to an 
interest rate per annum equal to the Government of Canada Yield plus 10.50%.
 na Œ not applicable
Redemption by the Trust
On or after the redemption dates in
dicated above, and subject to the prior
 approval of OSFI, the Trusts may redeem the securities in whole without 

the consent of the holders. 
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we redeemed all of our 
BMO Capital Trust Securities 
Œ Series A (“BMO BOaTS 
Œ Series A”) at a 
redemption amount equal to $1,000, representing an aggregate redemp
-tion of $350 million, plus unpaid indicated distributions. 
On November 23, 2010, we also announced our intention to redeem
 all of our BMO Capital Trust Securities 
Œ Series B (“BMO BOaTS 
Œ Series B”) 
at a redemption amount equal to 
$1,000
, representing an aggregate 
redemption of $400 million,

Common Shares
We are authorized by our sharehol
ders to issue an unlimited number 
of our common shares, without par va
lue, for unlimited consideration. 
Our common shares are not redeemable or convertible. Dividends 

are declared by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and the 

amount can vary from quarter to quarter. 
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we issued 14,752,536 
common shares primarily through our dividend reinvestment and share 

purchase plan and the exercise of stock options. We did not issue any 

common shares through a public offering.
During the year ended October 31, 2009, we issued 33,340,000 
common shares through a public offering at a price of $30.00 per share, 

representing an aggregate issuance of $1.0 billion. We also issued 

12,330,922 common shares primarily through our dividend reinvestment 

and share purchase plan and the exercise of stock options. 
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On October 27, 2010, we announced our intention to renew our 

normal course issuer bid, subject to the approval of the Office of 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (“OSFI”) and the 

Toronto Stock Exchange under which we may repurchase for cancellation 

up to 15,000,000 BMO common shares (representing approximately 

2.7% of our common shares outstanding). 
We participated in a normal course issuer bid during the period 
from December 2, 2009 to December 1, 2010 under which we were 
able to repurchase for cancellation up to 15,000,000 common shares, 
approximately 2.7% of our common shares then outstanding.
During the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we did 
not repurchase any common shares. 
Issuances Exchangeable into Common Shares
One of our subsidiaries, Bank of Montreal Securities Canada Limited 
(“BMSCL”), has issued various classes of non-voting shares that can 

be exchanged at the option of the ho
lder for our common shares, based 
on a formula. If all of these BMSCL shares had been converted into 

our common shares, up to 252,023, 252,507 and 263,397 of our common 

shares would have been needed to complete the exchange as at 

October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Share Redemption and Dividend Restrictions
OSFI must approve any plan to redeem any of our preferred share 

issues for cash.
We are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our 
preferred or common shares when we would be, as a result of paying 

such a dividend, in contravention of the capital adequacy, liquidity 

or any other regulatory directives issued under the 
Bank Act. In addition, 
common share dividends cannot be paid unless all dividends declared 

and payable on our preferred shares have been paid or sufficient funds 

have been set aside to do so.
In addition, we have agreed that if either BMO Capital Trust or 
BMO Capital Trust II (the “Trusts”), two of our subsidiaries, fail to pay any 

required distribution on their capital trust securities, we will not declare 

dividends of any kind on any of our preferred or common shares for a 
period of time following the Trusts’ failure to pay the required distribution 

(as defined in the applicable prospectuse
s) unless the Trusts first pay such 
distribution to the holders of their capital trust securities (see Note 18).
Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment 
and Share Purchase Plan (“the Plan”)
We offer a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan for our 
share 
holders. Participation in the Plan is optional. Under the terms of 
the Plan, cash dividends on common 
shares are reinvested to purchase 
additional common shares. Shareholders also have the opportunity 

to make optional cash payments to acquire additional common shares.
We may issue common shares from treasury at an average of 
the closing price of our common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange 

based on the five trading days prior to the last business day of the 

month or we may purchase them on the open market at market prices. 

During the year ended October 31, 2010, we issued a total of 9,749,878 

common shares (9,402,542 in 2009) under the Plan.
Potential Share Issuances
As at October 31, 2010, we had reserved 24,076,259 common shares 

for potential issuance in respect of the Plan and 252,017 common shares 

in respect of the exchange of certain shares of BMSCL. We also have 

reserved 15,232,139 common shares for the potential exercise of stock 

options, as further described in Note 22.
Treasury Shares
When we purchase our common shares
 as part of our trading business, 
we record the cost of those shares 
as a reduction in shareholders’ equity. 
If those shares are resold at a price higher than their cost, the premium 

is recorded as an increase in contributed surplus. If those shares are 
resold at a price below their cost, the discount is recorded as a reduction 

first to contributed surplus and then 
to retained earnings for any amounts 
in excess of total contributed surplus related to treasury shares.
Notes
BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010
147
Our objective is to maintain a strong capital position in a cost-effective 
structure that: meets our target regulatory capital ratios and internal 

assessment of required economic capital; is consistent with our targeted 
credit ratings; underpins our oper
ating groups’ business strategies; 
and builds depositor confidence and long-term shareholder value.
Our approach includes establishing limits, goals and performance 
measures for the management of balance sheet positions, risk levels 

and minimum capital amounts, as well as issuing and redeeming capital 

instruments to obtain the most cost-effective capital structure possible.
Regulatory capital requirements and risk-weighted assets for the 
consolidated entity are determined on a Basel II basis.
Tier 1 capital represents more permanent forms of capital, and 
primarily includes common shareholders’ equity, preferred shares 

and innovative hybrid instruments, less a deduction for goodwill and 

excess intangible assets and other deductions required under Basel II. 

Total capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, net of certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital is primarily comprised of subordinated debentures and 

the eligible portion of the general allowance for credit losses. Deductions 

from Tier 2 capital are primarily comprised of our investment in insurance 

subsidiaries and other substantial investments along with other Basel II 

deductions. Details of components of our capital position are presented in 

Notes 16, 17, 18 and 20.

Stock Option Plan
We maintain a Stock Option Plan for designated officers and employees. 
Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the closing price of 

our common shares on the day prior to the grant date. Options vest 25% 

per year over a four-year period starti
ng from their grant date. A portion 
of the options can only be exercised once certain performance targets 

are met. All options expire 10 years from their grant date.
Employee compensation expense related to this plan for the years 
ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $17 million, $8 million 

and $12 million before tax, respectively ($16 million, $7 million and 

$11 million after tax, respectively).
The intrinsic value of a stock option is the difference between the 
current market price of our common shares and the strike price of the 
We determine the fair value of stock options on their grant date 
and record this amount as compensation expense over the period that 

the stock options vest, with a corresponding increase to contributed

contributed surplus, in share capital. Stock options granted to employees

option. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding 
at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $189 million, $158 million and

exercisable at October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $119 million, 

$120 million and $101 million, respectively. 
Our Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Tangible Common Equity Ratio, Total Capital 
Ratio and Assets-to-Capital Multiple are the primary capital measures.
• The Tier 1 Capital Ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided 

by risk-weighted assets.
• The Tangible Common Equity Ratio is defined as common 
shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangibles, divided 

by risk-weighted assets.
• The Total Capital Ratio is defined as total capital divided 
by risk-weighted assets.
• The Assets-to-Capital Multiple is calculated by dividing total 

assets, including specified off-balance sheet items net of other 

specified deductions, by total capital.

(in years)
 6.5 6.5 7.3 Changes to the input assumptions can result in different fair value estimates. 
Expected dividend yield is determined using the historic yield for 

the prior year. Expected volatility is based on an equal weighting of the 

implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and the 

historical volatility of our share price. The risk-free rate is based on 
the yields of Canadian strip bonds with a maturity similar to the expected
 period until exercise of the options. The weighted-average exercise 

price on the grant date for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 

2008 was $53.45, $34.12 and $59.14, respectively.
Other Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
Share Purchase Plan
We offer our employees the option of directing a portion of their gross 

salary toward the purchase of 
our common shares. We match 50% 
of employee contributions up to 6% of their individual gross salary. 
The shares held in the employee shar
e purchase plan are purchased 
on the open market and are considered outstanding for purposes of 
computing earnings per share. The di
vidends earned on our common 
shares held by the plan are used to purchase additional common 

shares on the open market.
We account for our contribution as employee compensation 
expense when it is contributed to the plan.
Employee compensation expense related to this plan for the 
years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 
$41

 and $41 million, respectively. There were 17,244,042, 17,360,921 and 

14,958,315 common shares held in this plan for the years ended 

October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Mid-Term Incentive Plans
We offer mid-term incentive plans for executives and certain senior 

employees. Depending on the plan, 
these pay either a single cash 
payment at the end of the three-year period of the plan, or three annual 
cash payments in each of the three years of the plan. The amount 
of the payment is adjusted to reflect reinvested dividends and changes 

in the market value of our common shares. For units granted prior to 

2009, for certain executive and some senior employee grants, a portion 

of the incentive payment 
also varies based on performance targets 
driven by annualized total share 
holder return compared with that of 
our Canadian competitors.
Mid-term incentive plan units granted during the years ended 
October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totalled 5,651,067, 5,950,028 and 

4,548,827, respectively. We entered into agreements with third parties 

to assume most of our obligations related to these plans in exchange 

for cash payments of $268 million, $187 million and $267 million in the 
years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts 
paid under these agreements were recorded in our Consolidated Balance 

Sheet in other assets and are recorded as employee compensation 

expense evenly over the period prior to payment to employees. 

Amounts related to units granted to employees who are eligible to retire 

are expensed at the time of grant. We no longer have any liability for 

the obligations transferred to third parties because any future payments 

required will be the responsibility 
of the third parties. The amount 
deferred and recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet 

totalled $127 million and $106 million as at October 31, 2010 and 2009, 

respectively. The deferred amount as at October 31, 2010 is expected to 

be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years (1.7 years 

in 2009). Employee compensation expense related to these plans 

for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $234 million, 

$202 million and $239 million before tax, respectively ($164 million, 

$137 million and $160 million after tax, respectively).

For the remaining obligations related to plans for which we have 
not entered into agreements with third parties, the amount of com-
pensation expense is amortized over the period prior to payment to 

employees and adjusted to reflect reinvested dividends and the current 

market value of our common shares. Mid-term incentive plan units 

granted under these plans during the years ended October 31, 2010, 

2009 and 2008 totalled 512,649, 572,348 and 255,286, respectively. 

The weighted-average grant date fair value of the units granted during 

the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27 million, 

$22 million and $16 million, respectively. Payments made under these 

plans for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 

$18 million, $13 million and $11 million, respectively. The liability related 

to these plans as at October 31, 2010 and 2009 was $52 million and 

$32 million, respectively.
Employee compensation expense related to plans for which 
we have not entered into agreements with third parties for the years 

ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $32 million, $24 million 

and $4 million before tax, respectively ($22 million, $16 million and 

$3 million after tax, respectively). We commenced economically hedging 

the impact of the change in the mark
et value of our common shares 
in fiscal 2008 by entering into total return swaps with an external 
counter-
party. Hedging gains of $7 million were recognized for the year
 ended October 31, 2010 (hedging gains of $11 million in 2009 and hedging 

losses of $4 million in 2008), resulting in net employee compensation 

expense of $25 million before tax ($17 million after tax) ($13 million 

before tax ($9 million after tax) in 2009 and $8 million before tax 

($6 million after tax) in 2008).
A total of 14,343,868, 12,491,078 and 9,900,297 mid-term incentive 
plan units were outstanding for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 
and 2008, respectively.
Deferred Incentive Plans
We offer deferred incentive plans for members of our Board of Directors, 

executives, and key employees in BMO Capital Markets and Private 

Client Group. Under these plans, fees, annual incentive payments and/or 

commissions can be deferred as stock units of our common shares. 
Note 23:  
Employee Compensation 
Œ Pension and 
Other Employee Future Benefits
Pension and Other Employee Future Benefit Plans
We have a number of arrangements in Canada, the United States and 

the United Kingdom that provide pension and other employee future 

benefits to our retired and current employees.
Pension arrangements include defined benefit statutory pension 
plans, as well as supplemental arrangements that provide pension 

benefits in excess of statutory limits. Generally, under these plans 

we provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s years of service 

and average annual earnings over a period of time prior to retirement. 

We are responsible for ensuring that the statutory pension plans 

have sufficient assets to pay the pension benefits upon retirement of 
employees. Voluntary contributions can be made by employees but 
are not required.
We also provide defined contribution pension plans to employees 
in some of our subsidiaries. Under these plans, we are responsible 

for contributing a predetermined amount to a participant’s retirement 

savings, based on a percentage of that employee’s salary.
We recognize the cost of our pension plans in employee compen-
sation expense as the employees work for us.
We also provide other employee future benefits, including 
health and dental care benefits and life insurance, for current and 

retired employees. 
These stock units are fully vested on the grant date. The value of these 

stock units is adjusted to reflect reinvested dividends and changes in 

the market value of our common shares.
Deferred incentive payments are paid upon retirement or resig-
nation. The deferred incentive payments can be made in cash or shares.
Employee compensation expense for these plans is recorded 
in the year the fees, incentive payments and/or commissions are 

earned. Changes in the amount of the incentive payments as a result 

of dividends and share price movements are recorded as employee 

compensation expense in the period of the change.
Deferred incentive plan units granted during the years ended 
October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totalled 283,791, 456,943 and 379,034, 

respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the units 

granted during the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 

was $16 million, $19 million and $20 million, respectively.
Liabilities related to these plans are recorded in other liabilities in 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet and totalled $233 million and $172 million
 as at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Payments made under 

these plans for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 

$3 million, $12 million and $5 million, respectively.
Employee compensation expense (recovery) related to these plans 
for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $52 million, 

$38 million and $(46) million before tax, respectively ($36 million, 

$26 million and $(31) million after tax, respectively). We have entered 

into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to these plans. 

Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as employee 

compensation expense in the period in which they arise. Hedging gains 

(losses) for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of 

$48 million, $36 million and $(52) million before tax, respectively, were 

also recognized, resulting in net employee compensation expense of 

$4 million, $2 million and $6 million before tax, respectively ($3 million, 

$1 million and $4 million after tax, respectively).
A total of 3,544,651, 3,139,730 and 3,101,995 deferred incentive plan 
units were outstanding for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 and 

2008, respectively. 
Pension and Other Employee Future Benefit Liabilities
We have the following types of benefit liabilities: defined benefit 

and defined contribution pension liabilities and other employee future 

benefit liabilities. These benefit li
abilities represent the amount of 
pension and other employee future benefits that our employees and 

retirees have earned as at year end.
Our actuaries perform valuations of
 our benefit liabilities for 
pension and other employee future benefits as at October 31 of each 

year for our Canadian plans (September 30 for our U.S. plans), using the 

projected benefit method prorated on service, based on management’s 

assumptions about discount rates, rate of compensation increase, 

retirement age, mortality and health care cost trend rates.
The discount rates for the main Canadian and U.S. pension and 
other employee future benefit plans were selected using high-quality 

corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.
Components of the change in our benefit liabilities year over 
year and our pension and other employee future benefit expense are 

as follows:
Benefits earned by employees 
represent benefits earned in the 
current year. They are determined with reference to the current workforce
 and the amount of benefits to which employees will be entitled upon 

retirement, based on the provisions of our benefit plans.

Asset Allocations
The investment policy for plan assets is to have a diversified mix 
of quality investments that are expected to provide a superior real rate 

of return over the long term, while limiting performance volatility. 
Interest cost on benefit liabilities 
represents the increase in the 
liabilities that results from the passage of time. 
Actuarial gains or losses 
may arise in two ways. First, each year 
our actuaries recalculate the benefit liabilities and compare them to 

those estimated as at the previous year end. Any differences that result 

from changes in assumptions or from plan experience being different 
from management’s expectations at the previous year end are considered
 actuarial gains or losses. Secondly, actuarial gains and losses arise 

when there are differences between expected and actual returns on 

plan assets.
At the beginning of each year, we determine whether the unrecog-
nized actuarial gain or loss is more than 10% of the greater of our 

plan asset or benefit liability balances. Any unrecognized actuarial gain 

or loss in excess of this 10% threshold is recognized in expense over 

the expected remaining service period of active employees. Amounts 

below the 10% threshold are not recognized in income.
Plan amendments 
are changes in our benefit liabilities as a result 
of changes to provisions of the plans. These amounts are recognized 

in expense over the remaining service period of active employees for 

pension plans and over the expected average remaining period to full 

benefit eligibility for other employee future benefit plans.
Expected return on assets 
represents management’s best 
estimate of the long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to 

the fair value of plan assets. We es
tablish our estimate of the expected 

rate of return on plan assets based on the plan’s target asset allocation 

and estimated rates of return for each asset class. Estimated rates 

of return are based on expected returns from fixed income securities, 

which take into consideration bond yields. An equity risk premium 
is then applied to estimate equity returns. Returns from other asset 
classes are set to reflect the relative risks of these classes as compared 
to fixed income and equity assets. Differences between expected 
and actual returns on assets are included in our actuarial gain or loss 

balance, as described above.
Settlements 
occur when benefit liabilities for plan participants 
are settled, usually through lump sum cash payments, and as a result 

we no longer have any obligation to provide such participants with 

benefit payments in the future.
Funding of Pension and Other Employee
Future Benefit Plans
Our statutory pension plans in Canada, the United States and the United 
Kingdom are funded by us and the assets in these plans are used to 

pay benefits to retirees.
Our supplementary pension plans 
in Canada are partially funded, 
while in the United States the pl
an is unfunded. Our other employee 
future benefit plans in the United States and Canada are either partially 

funded or unfunded. 
Pension and benefit payments related to these 
plans are either paid through the respective plan or paid directly by us.
We measure the fair value of plan assets as at October 31 for 
our Canadian plans (September 30 for our U.S. plans). In addition to 

actuarial valuations for accounting purposes, we are required to prepare 

valuations for determining our pension contributions (our “funding 
valuation”). The most recent funding valuation for our main Canadian plan 
was performed as at October 31, 2010. The next funding valuation will 

be performed as at October 31, 2011. An annual funding valuation 

is required for our U.S. statutory plan. The most recent valuation was 

performed as at January 1, 2010. 
Plan assets are rebalanced within ranges around target allocations. 
Allocations as at the end of each year and the target allocations for 

October 31 are as follows:

hypothetical and the impact of changes in each key assumption may 

not be linear. The sensitivities to changes in each key variable have 

been calculated independently of the impact of changes in other key 

variables. Actual experience may result in simultaneous changes in a 

number of key assumptions. Changes in one factor may result in changes 

in another, which could amplify or reduce certain sensitivities.

We report our provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statement 
of Income based upon transactions recorded in our consolidated financial 

statements regardless of when they are recognized for income tax 

purposes, with the exception of repatriation of retained earnings from 

our foreign subsidiaries, as noted below.
In addition, we record an income tax expense or benefit directly 
in shareholders’ equity when the taxe
s relate to amounts recorded in 

shareholders’ equity. For example, income tax expense (recovery) on 
hedging gains (losses) related to our net investment in foreign operations 

is recorded in shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other compre-
hensive income (loss) on translation of net foreign operations.
The future income tax balances included in other assets of 
$559 million and in other liabilities of $332 million as at October 31, 2010 

($513 million and $330 million, respectively, in 2009) are the cumulative 
amount of tax applicable to temporary differences between the 
accounting and tax values of our assets and liabilities. Future income 

tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates expected to 

apply when these differences reverse. Changes in future income tax 

assets and liabilities related to a change in tax rates are recorded 

in income in the period the tax rate change is substantively enacted.

tax loss carryforwards that will expire in 2030, $24 million (net of 
valuation allowance) related to U.S. operations that will expire in 2031 

and $1 million related to Chinese operations that will expire in 2016. 

The valuation allowance as at October 31, 2010 and 2009 is primarily 

attributable to future income tax assets generated in certain U.S. states 

for which management believes it is more likely than not that realiza-

tion of these assets will not occur.
Income that we earn in foreign countries through our branches 
or subsidiaries is generally subject to tax in those countries. We are 

also subject to Canadian taxation on the income earned in our foreign 

branches. Canada allows a credit for foreign taxes paid on this income. 

Upon repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, we 
would be required to pay tax on certain of these earnings. As repatriation
 of such earnings is not planned in the foreseeable future, we have 

not recorded the related future income tax liability. The Canadian and 

foreign taxes that would be payable, at existing tax rates, if all of our 

foreign subsidiaries’ earnings were repatriated as at October 31, 2010, 

2009 and 2008 are estimated to be $236 million, $266 million and 

$329 million, respectively.

Note 25: Earnings Per Share 
Basic Earnings per Share
Our basic earnings per share is calc
ulated by dividing our net income, 
after deducting total preferred share 
dividends, by the daily average 
number of fully paid common shares outstanding throughout the year.

(Canadian $)

3.09 3.79Diluted Earnings per Share
Diluted earnings per share represents
 what our earnings per share would 
have been if instruments convertible into common shares that had the 
impact of reducing our earnings per share had been converted either at 

the beginning of the year for instruments that were outstanding all year 

or from the date of issue for instruments issued during the year.
Convertible Shares
In determining diluted earnings per share, we increase net income 

available to common shareholders by dividends paid on convertible 

preferred shares as these dividends would not have been paid if the 

shares had been converted at the beg
inning of the year. These dividends 
were less than $1 million for the years ended October 31, 2010, 2009 

and 2008. Similarly, we increase t
he average number of common shares 

outstanding by the number of shares that would have been issued 

had the conversion taken place at the beginning of the year.
Our Series 10 Class B Preferred shares, in certain circumstances, 
are convertible into common shares. These conversions are not included 

in the calculation of diluted earning
s per share as we have the option 
to settle the conversion in cash instead of common shares.
Employee Stock Options 
In determining diluted earnings per share, we increase the average 

number of common shares outstandi
ng by the number of shares that 
would have been issued if all stock options with a strike price below the 

average share price for the year had been exercised. When performance 

targets have not been met, affected options are excluded from the 

calculation. We also decrease the 
average number of common shares 
outstanding by the number of our common shares that we could have 

repurchased if we had used the proceeds from the exercise of stock 

options to repurchase them on the 
open market at the average share 
price for the year. We do not adjust for stock options with a strike price 

above the average share price for the year because including them 

would increase our earnings per share, not dilute it.

accrual for interest, was $300 million and $376 million, respectively, 

all of which affects our tax rate. It is difficult to predict changes in UTBs 

over the next 12 months.
We accrue applicable income tax-related penalties within income 
tax expense on our UTBs. We accrue applicable income tax-related 

interest as interest expense. As at October 31, 2010 and 2009, our accrual 

for interest and penalties related to income taxes, net of payments on 
deposit to taxing authorities, was $20 million and $17 million, respectively. 
There was a net increase of $3 million in the accrual for interest and 

penalties during the year ended October 31, 2010.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to Canadian federal and 
provincial income tax, U.S. federal, state and local income tax, and

Note 26: Operating and Geographic Segmentation
Operating Groups
We conduct our business through three operating groups, each of 
which has a distinct mandate. We determine our operating groups based 
on our management structure and therefore these groups, and results 
attributed
 to them, may not be comparable with those of other financial 
services companies. We evaluate the performance of our groups using 

measures such as net income, revenue growth, return on equity, net 

economic profit and non-interest expense-to-revenue (productivity) 

ratio, as well as cash operating leverage.
Personal and Commercial Banking
Personal and Commercial Banking (“P&C”) is comprised of two operating 

segments: Personal and Commercial Banking Canada and Personal and 

Commercial Banking U.S.
Personal and Commercial Banking Canada
Personal and Commercial Banking Canada (“P&C Canada”) offers a 

full range of consumer and business products and services, including 

everyday banking, financing, investing and credit cards, as well as 

a full suite of commercial and capital markets products and financial 

advisory services, through a network of branches, telephone banking, 

online banking, mortgage specialists and automated banking machines. 

Effective in the year ended October 31, 2009, the results of our term 

deposits business are included in P&C Canada rather than Private Client 

Group, where the business is now better aligned with P&C Canada’s 

retail product strategy. Prior periods have been restated to reflect 

this reclassification.
Personal and Commercial Banking U.S.
Personal and Commercial Banking U.S. (“P&C U.S.”) offers a full range 

of products and services to personal and business clients in select 

U.S. Midwest markets through branches and direct banking channels 

such as telephone banking, online banking and a network of automated 

banking machines. Effective in the year ended October 31, 2010, we 

identified U.S. mid-market client accounts that would be better served 

by a commercial banking model and transferred their balances to 

P&C U.S. from BMO Capital Markets. Prior periods have been restated 

to reflect this reclassification.
Private Client Group
Private Client Group (“PCG”), our group of wealth management 

businesses, serves a full range of client segments, from mainstream 

to ultra-high net worth, as well as select institutional markets, 

with a broad offering of wealth management products and solutions. 

PCG operates in both Canada and the United States, as well as in China 

and the United Kingdom. Effective in the year ended October 31, 2009, 

all of our insurance operations are included within PCG, bringing 

our insurance capabilities and skill 
sets together as part of our wealth 
management offering. Prior periods have been restated to reflect 

this reclassification.
BMO Capital Markets
BMO Capital Markets (“BMO CM”) combines all of our businesses 

serving corporate, institutional and government clients. In Canada and 

the United States, these clients span a broad range of industry sectors. 

BMO CM also serves clients in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia 

and Australia. It offers clients complete financial solutions, including 

equity and debt underwriting, corporate lending and project financing, 
mergers and acquisitions, advisory services, merchant banking, 
securitization, treasury and market risk management, debt and equity 
research and institutional sales and trading. Effective in the year 
ended October 31, 2010, we identified U.S. mid-market client accounts 

that would be better served by a commercial banking model and 

transferred the accounts to P&C U.S. from BMO CM. Prior periods have 

been restated to reflect this reclassification.
Corporate Services
Corporate Services includes the corporate units that provide expertise 
and governance support in areas such as Technology and Operations 
(“T&O”), strategic planning, law, finance, internal audit, risk management, 
corporate communications, economics, corporate marketing, human 

resources and learning. Operating results include revenues and expenses 

associated with certain securitization activities, the hedging of foreign-

source earnings, and activities related to the management of certain 

balance sheet positions and our overall asset liability structure.
T&O manages, maintains and provides governance over our 
information technology, operations services, real estate and sourcing. 

T&O focuses on enterprise-wide priorities that improve quality and 

efficiency to deliver an excellent customer experience.
Operating results for T&O are included with Corporate Services for 
reporting purposes. However, costs of T&O services are transferred to 
the three operating groups. As such, results for Corporate Services largely
 reflect the activities outlined above.
Corporate Services also includes residual revenues and expenses 
representing the differences between actual amounts earned or incurred 

and the amounts allocated to operating groups.
Basis of Presentation
The results of these operating segments are based on our internal 

financial reporting systems. The accounting policies used in these 

segments are generally consistent with those followed in the prepara-

tion of our consolidated financial statements as disclosed in Note 1 and 

throughout the consolidated financial statements. Notable accounting 

measurement differences are the taxable equivalent basis adjustment 

and the provisions for credit losses, as described below.
Taxable Equivalent Basis
We analyze net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis (“teb”) 

at the operating group level. This basis includes an adjustment which 

increases GAAP revenues and the GAAP provision for income taxes 
by an amount that would raise revenues on certain tax-exempt securities
 to a level that incurs tax at the statutory rate. The operating groups’ 

teb adjustments are eliminated in Corporate Services.
We now account for certain BMO CM transactions on a basis 
that reflects their teb. We believe these adjustments are useful and 

reflect how BMO CM manages its business, since it enhances the 

comparability of taxable revenues and tax-advantaged revenues. 

The change results in increases in net interest income and income 

taxes in BMO CM with offsetting amounts reflected in Corporate Services. 

There was no overall net income change in either of the two groups. 

Prior periods have been restated to reflect this reclassification. 
Provisions for Credit Losses
Provisions for credit losses are generally allocated to each group 

based on expected losses for that group. Differences between expected 

loss provisions and provisions required under GAAP are included in 

Corporate Services.
Securitization Accounting
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we changed the manner 

in which we report securitized assets in our segmented disclosure. 

Previously, certain securitized mortgage assets were not reported 

in P&C Canada’s balance sheet. We now report all securitized mortgage 

assets in P&C Canada, with offsetting amounts in Corporate Services, 

and net interest income earned on all securitized mortgage assets 

is included in P&C Canada net interest income. Previously, net interest 

income earned on certain securitized mortgage assets was included 

in P&C Canada non-interest revenue. Prior periods have been restated 

to conform to this new presentation.

 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
Inter-Group Allocations
Various estimates and allocation methodologies are used in the 
preparation of the operating groups’ financial information. We allocate 

expenses directly related to earning revenue to the groups that earned 

the related revenue. Expenses not directly related to earning revenue, 

such as overhead expenses, are a
llocated to operating groups using 
allocation formulas applied on a consistent basis. Operating group net 

interest income reflects internal funding charges and credits on the 

groups’ assets, liabilities and capital, at market rates, taking into account

Geographic Information
We operate primarily in Canada and the United States but we also 
have operations in the United Kingdom, Europe, the Caribbean and 
Asia, which are grouped in Other countries. We allocate our results 

by geographic region based on the location of the unit responsible for 

managing the related assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, except 

for the consolidated provision for credit losses, which is allocated 

based upon the country of ultimate risk.

Note 27: Related Party Transactions
Note 28: Contingent Liabilities
Related parties include directors, executives and their affiliates, along 
with joint ventures and equity-accounted investees.
Directors, Executives and Their Affiliates
Loans are available to executives at preferred rates related to 
transfers we initiate. The transferee loan amounts outstanding under 
preferred rate mortgage loan agreements were $47 million and 

$53 million at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The interest 

earned on these loans is recorded in interest, dividend and fee 

income in our Consolidated Statement of Income.
We provide certain banking services to our directors on the same 
terms that we offer to our customers for these services. Loans to 

directors totalled $26 million and $5 million at October 31, 2010 and 

2009, respectively.
Board of Directors Compensation
Stock Option Plan
During the year ended October 31, 2002, we introduced a stock option 

plan for non-officer directors, the terms of which are the same as 
the plan for designated officers and employees described in Note 22. 
Options to purchase a total of 147,000 common shares were granted 

under the Non-Officer Director Stock Option Plan. The granting of options 

under this plan was discontinued effective November 1, 2003. 
Stock option expense for this plan is calculated in the same manner 
as employee stock option expense. The expense related to this plan 

was fully amortized prior to November 1, 2007.  
Deferred Share Units
Members of our Board of Directors ar
e required to take 100% of their 
annual retainers and other fees in
 the form of either our common 
shares (purchased on the open market) or deferred share units until 

such time as the dir
ectors’ shareholdings are greater than six times 
their annual retainers as directors. After this threshold is reached, 

directors are required to take at le
ast 50% of their annual retainers 
in this form.
Members of the Harris Financia
l Corp. Board of Directors are 
required to take a specified minimum am
ount of their annual retainers 
and other fees in the form of deferred share units.
Deferred share units allocated under these deferred share unit 
plans are adjusted to reflect dividends and changes in the market value 

of our common shares. The value of these deferred share units is paid 

upon termination of service as a director.
Liabilities related to these plans are recorded in other liabilities in 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet and totalled $28 million and $22 million 

as at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Expenses for these plans 

are included in other expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income 

and totalled $4 million, $4 million and $4 million for the years ended 

October 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Joint Ventures and Equity-Accounted Investees
We provide banking services to our joint ventures and equity-accounted 

investees on the same terms that we offer to our customers for these 

services.
Our common share investment in a joint venture of which we own 
50% totalled $366 million as at October 31, 2010 ($335 million in 2009), 

which was eliminated upon proportionate consolidation.
Our investments in entities over which we exert significant influence
 totalled $196 million as at October 31, 2010 ($613 million in 2009).
Employees
A select suite of customer loan and mortgage products is offered to 

employees at rates normally accorded to preferred customers. We also 

offer employees a fee-based subsidy on annual credit card fees. 
(a) Legal Proceedings 
In the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications Corporation (“Adelphia”), 
the Official Committees of Unsecured Creditors and Equity Security Holders
 or their successor, the Adelphia Recovery Trust (“ART”), filed a Complaint 

against Bank of Montreal, BMO Capital Markets Corp. (previously Harris 
Nesbitt Corp.), BMO Capital Markets Financing Inc. (the “BMO Defendants”), 
and other financial institutions. 
The Complaint alleged various federal 
statutory and common law claims and sought damages of approximately 

$5 billion. The action brought by the ART was settled during the year 

ended October 31, 2010 as against many financial institutions, including 

the BMO Defendants. A separate action brought by a group of plaintiffs 

that opted out of the settlement of a class action brought by investors 

in Adelphia securities remains pending against BMO Capital Markets Corp. 

and Bank of Montreal. Management believes that there are strong 

defences to this claim and will vigorously defend the action.
BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, 
has been named as a defendant in several individual actions and 

proposed class actions in Canada and the United States brought on 

behalf of shareholders of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Many of the actions have 

been resolved as to BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., including two during the 

year ended October 31, 2010. Management believes that there are strong 

defences to the remaining claims and will vigorously defend them. 
Following our disclosures of mark-to-market losses in our commod-
ities trading businesses on April 27, 2007 and May 17, 2007 aggregating 
$680 million (pre-tax) as of April 30, 2007, we have received inquiries, 
requests for documents or subpoenas pertaining to those trading losses 

from securities, commodities, banking and law enforcement authorities. 

On November 18, 2008, a number of proceedings were commenced 
by these authorities against certain parties that were involved in the 
commodities trading losses. We are not a party to these proceedings. 

We are cooperating with all of these authorities.
Bank of Montreal and its subsidiaries are party to other legal 
proceedings, including regulatory investigations, in the ordinary course 

of their businesses. While there is inherent difficulty in predicting the 

outcome of these proceedings, management does not expect the out-

come of any of these other proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, 

to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated finan 
cial position 
or the results of operations of Bank of Montreal.
(b) Collateral
When entering into trading activities such as reverse repurchase 

agreements, securities borrowing and lending activities or financing and 

derivative transactions, we require our counterparty to provide us with 

collateral that will protect us from losses in the event of the counter-

party’s default. The fair value of collateral that we are permitted to sell 

or repledge (in the absence of default by the owner of the collateral) 

was $32,837 million as at October 31, 2010 ($21,905 million in 2009). 

The fair value of financial assets accepted as collateral that we have sold 
or repledged was $24,733 million as at October 31, 2010 ($15,479 million 
in 2009).
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes

 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
Collateral transactions are conducted under terms that are usual 
and customary in standard trading activities. If there is no default, 
the securities or their equivalent
 must be returned to the counterparty 

at the end of the contract.
(c) Pledged Assets
In the normal course of our business, we pledge assets as security 

for various liabilities that we incur. The following tables summarize 

our pledged assets, to whom they are pledged and in relation 

to what activity:

  29,562 31,525Total assets pledged 
 79,475 70,837 Excludes restricted cash resources disclosed in Note 2. 
We record trading assets and liabilities, derivatives, available-for-sale 
securities and securities sold but not yet purchased at fair value and 

other non-trading assets and liabilities at amortized cost less allowances 

or write-downs for impairment. Where there is no quoted market value, 

fair value is determined using a variety of valuation techniques and 

assumptions. These fair values are based upon the estimated amounts 

for individual assets and liabilities and do not include an estimate of 

the fair value of any of the legal entities or underlying operations that 

comprise our business.
Fair value amounts disclosed represent point-in-time estimates 
that may change in subsequent reporting periods due to market 

con 
ditions or other factors. Fair value 
represents our estimate of the 
amounts for which we could exchange the financial instruments with 

willing third parties who were interested in acquiring the instruments. 

In most cases, however, the financial instruments are not typically 

exchangeable or exchanged and therefore it is difficult to determine 

their fair value. In those cases, we have estimated fair value taking 

into account only changes in interest rates and credit risk that have 
occurred since we acquired them or entered into the underlying contracts. 
These calculations represent management’s best estimates based on a 

range of methodologies and assumptions; since they involve uncertain-

ties, the fair values may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate 

settlement of the instruments.
Interest rate changes are the main cause of changes in the fair 
value of our financial instruments.

Financial Instruments Whose Book Value
Approximates Fair Value
Fair value is assumed to equal book value for acceptance-related 
liabilities and securities lent or so
ld under repurchase agreements, due 
to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Fair value is also 

assumed to equal book value for our cash resources, certain other assets 

and certain other liabilities.
Loans
In determining the fair value of our loans, we incorporate the following 

assumption:
• For fixed rate and floating rate performing loans and customers’ 
liability under acceptances, we discount the remaining contractual 
cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayment, at market interest 

rates currently offered for loans with similar terms.
The value of our loan balances determined using the above assump
tion 
is further reduced by the allowance 
for credit losses to determine the 
fair value of our loan portfolio.
Securities
The fair value of our securities, both trading and available-for-sale, 

by instrument type and the methods used to determine fair value 

are provided in Note 3.
Derivative Instruments
The methods used to determine the fair value of derivative instruments 

are provided in Note 10.

Deposits
In determining the fair value of our deposits, we incorporate the 
following assumptions:
•  For fixed rate, fixed maturity deposits, we discount the remaining 
contractual cash flows for these deposits, adjusted for expected 

redemptions, at market interest rates currently offered for deposits 

with similar terms and risks.
•  For fixed rate deposits with no defined maturities, we consider fair 
value to equal book value based on book value being equivalent to 

the amount payable on the reporting date.

Valuation Techniques and Signiﬁ
 cant Inputs
We determine the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity and 
equity securities using quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) 

when these are available. When quoted prices in active markets are 

not available, we determine the fair value of financial instruments using 

models such as discounted cash flows with observable market inputs 
for inputs such as yield and prepayment rates or broker quotes and other 
third-party vendor quotes (Level 2). Fair value may also be determined 

using models where the significant market inputs are unobservable 

due to inactive or minimal market activity (Level 3). We maximize the 

use of market inputs to the extent possible. 
Our Level 2 trading securities are primarily valued using discounted 
cash flow models with observable spreads or based on broker quotes. 

The fair value of Level 2 available-for-sale securities is determined using 
discounted cash flow models with observable spreads or third-party vendor 
quotes. Level 2 structured note liabilities are valued using models with 
observable market information. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities are 

valued using industry standard models and observable market information.
Sensitivity analysis at October 31, 2010 for the most significant 
Level 3 instruments is provided below. 
Within Level 3 trading securities is corporate debt of $1,242 million 
that relates to securities that are hedged with total return swaps and 
credit default swaps that are also considered a Level 3 instrument. 
Fair Value Hierarchy
We use a fair value hierarchy to categorize the inputs we use in 
valuation techniques to measure fair value. The extent of our use of 
quoted market prices (L
evel 1), internal models using observable 
market information as inputs (Level 2) and internal models without 

observable market information as inputs (Level 3) in the valuation of 

securities, fair value liabilities, derivative assets and derivative 

liabilities was as follows:

The sensitivity analysis for the structured product is performed on an aggre-
gate basis and is described as part of the discussion on derivatives below.
Within Level 3 trading securities are mortgage-backed securities 
and collateralized mortgage obligations of $211 million. We determined 
the fair value of these securities based on expected discounted cash flows. 
The significant inputs for the valuation model include market yields 
and spread assumptions. The determination of market yields has the most 
significant impact on the valuation of these securities. The impact of 
assuming a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the market yield would 
result in a change in fair value of $(4) million and $5 million, respectively.
Within Level 3 available-for-sale corporate debt securities is a 
deferred purchase price amount of $633 million related to our off-balance 
sheet securitization activities. We have determined the valuation of the 

deferred purchase price (excess spread) based on expected future cash 

flows. The significant inputs for the valuation model include interest rate, 
weighted-average prepayment rate, weighted-average maturity, expected 
credit losses and weighted-average discount rate. The determination 

of interest rates has the most significant impact on the valuation of the 

deferred purchase price. Sensitivity analysis for the deferred purchase 

price is included 
in Note 8.
Within Level 3 derivative assets and derivative liabilities was 
$377 million and $51 million related to the mark-to-market of credit 

default swaps and total return swaps on the above noted trading 
securities, respectively. We have determ
ined the fair value of the structured 
product (securities and derivatives together), based on a model with 
observable and unobservable inputs. The discount margin of the under 
lying securities has the most significant impact on the valuation. The impact of

Signiﬁ
 cant Transfers
Transfers are made between the various fair value hierarchy levels 
due to changes in the availability of quoted market prices or observable 
market inputs due to changing market conditions. The following is 

a discussion of the significant transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and 
Level 3 balances for the years ended October 31, 2010 and 2009. 
During the year ended October 31, 2010, a portion of the asset-
backed commercial paper issued by the conduits known as the Montreal 

Accord were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 within corporate debt 
trading securities because we are now valuing the notes based on broker
 quotes rather than internal models due to increased broker/dealer trading 
of these securities, resulting in improved liquidity. In addition, certain 
available-for-sale corporate debt securities that were previously valued 
using observable market information were transferred from Level 2 to 

Level 1 as values for these securities became available in active markets.
During the year ended October 31, 2009, the mid-term notes and 
associated total return swap related to our credit protection vehicle 
were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 as there was improved liquidity 

in the inputs to our model and greater transparency of fair value as 

a result of our hedging transactions. Also in 2009, $23 million of trading 
securities, corporate debt were transferred from Level 1 to Level 3 
as the securities were no longer quoted in an active market subsequent 
to the issuer’s bankruptcy protection filing. As at October 31, 2010, 
management valued these securities using discounted estimated 
recoverable amounts.
 (1) Includes cash settlement of derivative assets and derivative liabilities.

 (2)  
Unrealized gains or losses on trading securities, derivative assets and derivative liabilities 

still held on October 31, 2010 are included in earnings in the year. For available-for-sale 
securities, the unrealized gains or losses on securities still held on October 31, 2010 are included 

in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 
 Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.

 2,548 1,735 3,007(a) Bankers’ Acceptances
Under United States GAAP, bankers’ acceptances purchased from other 
banks are classified as loans. Under Canadian GAAP, bankers’ acceptances 

purchased from other banks are recorded as interest bearing deposits 

with banks in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(b) Accounting for Securities Transactions
Under United States GAAP, securities transactions are recognized in 
our Consolidated Balance Sheet when we enter into the transaction. 
Under Canadian GAAP, securities transactions are recognized in our 

Consolidated Balance Sheet when the transaction is settled.
(c) Reclassification from Trading Securities to Available-for-Sale Securities
During the year ended October 31, 2008, we adopted new Canadian 

accounting guidance which allows, in rare circumstances, certain reclas-

sifications of non-derivative financial assets from the trading category 

to either the available-for-sale or held-to-maturity categories. This new 
guidance is consistent with United States GAAP, except that United 
States GAAP requires that the reclassification be recorded on the date 
the transfer is completed. We elected to transfer from trading to 

available-for-sale those securities for which we had a change in intent 

caused by market circumstances at that time to hold the securities for 

the foreseeable future rather than to exit or trade them in the short 

term. The Canadian accounting guidance was applicable on a retroactive 

basis to August 1, 2008 and the transfers took place at the fair value 

of the securities on August 1, 2008. We reclassified these securities 

under United States GAAP effective October 31, 2008 at their fair value 

at that date. This difference will reverse as these securities are sold. 
(d) Insurance Accounting
Under United States GAAP, fixed income and equity investments 

supporting the policy benefit liabilit
ies of life and health insurance 

contracts are classified as available-for-sale securities. Under Canadian 

GAAP, fixed income and equity investments supporting the policy 

benefit liabilities of life and health insurance contracts are designated 

as held-for-trading securities using the fair value option.
Under United States GAAP, liabilities for life insurance contracts, 
except universal life and other investment-type contracts, are determined
 using the net level premium method. For universal life and other 
investment-type contracts, liabilities represent policyholder account 
balances and include a reserve calculated using the net level premium 

method for some contracts. Under Canadian GAAP, liabilities for life insur-
ance contracts are determined using the Canadian asset liability method. 
Under United States GAAP, premiums received for universal life and 
other investment-type contracts are recorded as a liability. Under Canadian 
GAAP, these premiums are recorded in income and a liability for future 

policy benefits is established that is an offsetting charge to income.
Under both United States and Canadian GAAP, premiums from 
long-duration contracts are recognized in income when due and premiums, 
net of reinsurance, for short-duration contracts are recorded in income 

over the related contract period.
Under United States GAAP, reinsurance recoverables, deferred 
acquisition costs for life insurance and annuity contracts and the value of 
in-force life insurance business acquired (“VOBA”) are recorded as assets. 
Deferred acquisition costs and VOBA are then amortized. Under Canadian 
GAAP, these items are included in the insurance-related liability balance.
(e) Non-Cash Collateral
Under United States GAAP, non-cash collateral received in securities 
lending transactions that we are permitted by contract to sell or 

repledge is recorded as an asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet 
and a corresponding liability is recorded for the obligation to return 

the collateral. Under Canadian GAAP, such collateral and the related 

obligation are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

As a result of this difference, available-for-sale securities and other 

liabilities have been increased by $3,294 million and $197 million as 

at October 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
(f) Merchant Banking Investments
Under United States GAAP, our merchant banking subsidiaries account 
for their investments at cost or under the equity method. Under Canadian
 GAAP, these subsidiaries account for their investments at fair value, 

with changes in fair value recorded in income as they occur.
(g) Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts
Under United States GAAP, our right to reclaim cash collateral or the 

obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments 

are netted against the derivative instruments if they are executed 
  (1) Net of income taxes of $28 million in 2010, $30 million in 2009 and $60 million in 2008.
 (2) Net of income taxes of $64 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2009.
 (3) Net of income taxes of $71 million in 2010, $68 million in 2009 and $102 million in 2008.

with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement. Under 
Canadian GAAP, these amounts are not presented net. Cash collateral 

posted is recorded as a loan and cash collateral received is recorded as 

a deposit liability. The cash collateral applied against derivative assets 
and derivative liabilities was $2,094 million and $1,146 million as at 

October 31, 2010, respectively ($1,298 million and $48 million in 2009, 

respectively). Also under United States GAAP, derivative assets and 

liabilities having valid rights of set-off are reported on a net basis. 
Under Canadian GAAP, these derivative assets and liabilities are reported 
on a gross basis. As a result of offsetting, the fair value amounts of 
derivative instruments that have been netted against derivative assets 
and derivative liabilities was $31,537 million at October 31, 2010 
($28,998 million in 2009). 
(h) Derivatives
Certain of our interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges 

under Canadian GAAP must be marked to market through income 

under United States GAAP as they do not qualify for hedge accounting. 

Under Canadian GAAP, they qualify for hedge accounting and are 

measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
(i) Goodwill and Other Assets
Under United States GAAP, our acquisition of Suburban Bancorp, Inc. 

in 1994 was accounted for using the pooling of interests method.

Under Canadian GAAP, we accounted for this acquisition using the 
purchase method, which resulted in the recognition and amortization 
of fair value increments on buildings, goodwill and intangible assets 
associated with the acquisition. Effective November 1, 2001, goodwill 

is no longer amortized to income under either United States or 
Canadian GAAP. The remaining difference relates to the amortization 
of the fair value increments on buildings and intangible assets 

under Canadian GAAP.
(j) Pension and Other Employee Future Benefits
United States GAAP requires us to recognize the excess of the fair 
value of our pension and other employee future benefit plan assets 

over the corresponding benefit obligation as an asset and the shortfall 

of the fair value of our plan assets compared to the corresponding 

benefit obligation as a liability. This is done on a plan-by-plan basis. 

The unamortized actuarial gains (losses) and the cost (benefit) of 

plan amendments are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive 

(Income) Loss. Under Canadian GAAP, these amounts are recorded 

in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in other assets or other liabilities. 

There is no change in the calculation of the pension and other 

employee future benefits expense. Under United States GAAP, the 

pre-tax amounts included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive 

(Income) Loss are as follows:
under United States GAAP. Under United States GAAP, amounts related 
to our pension benefit plans and other employee future benefit plans 
are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
The estimated net actuarial loss and cost of plan amendments for 

the pension benefit plans that will be amortized from Accumulated Other 

Comprehensive Income, on a pre-tax basis, as an increase in pension 

expense during fiscal 2011 are $92 million and $15 million, respectively. 

The estimated net actuarial loss and benefit of plan amendments for 

other employee future benefit plans that will be amortized from Accumu-

lated Other Comprehensive Income, on a pre-tax basis, as an increase 

(decrease) in other employee future benefit expense during fiscal 2011 

are $6 million and $(8) million, respectively. Under Canadian GAAP, 

these amounts are amortized from other assets or other liabilities, on 

a pre-tax basis, to pension and other employee future benefit expense.
Effective November 1, 2000, we adopted a new Canadian account-
ing standard on pension and other employee future benefits that 

eliminated the then existing differences between Canadian and United 

States GAAP. When we adopted this new standard, we accounted for 

the change in accounting as a charge to retained earnings. As a result, 

there will continue to be an adjustment to our Consolidated Statement 

of Income until amounts previously deferred under United States GAAP 

have been fully amortized to income.
(k) Stock-based Compensation
Effective November 1, 2005, under United States GAAP, stock-based 
compensation granted to employees who are eligible to retire 

was expensed at the time of grant. We adopted this new standard 
prospectively, beginning with grants issued in fiscal 2006. We retro 
actively 
adopted new Canadian accounting guidance on stock-based compensation 
during the year ended October 31, 2006, which conformed with the 

United States accounting standard. Due to the differences in the methods 

of adoption, there was an adjustment to our Consolidated Statement of 

Income in the periods before fiscal 2010, when the stock-based compen-

sation granted prior to November 
1, 2005 was fully amortized.
(l) Liabilities and Equity
Under United States GAAP, certain of our capital trust securities that 

are ultimately convertible into a vari
able number of our common shares 
at the holder’s option are classified as non-controlling interest, with 

payments recognized as minority interest. Under Canadian GAAP, capital 

trust securities with this conversion feature are classified as liabilities, 

with payments recognized as interest expense. 
(m) Income Taxes
In addition to the tax impact of other differences between Canadian 

and United States GAAP, under United States GAAP, tax rate changes 

do not have any impact on the measurement of our future income tax 

balances until they are passed into law. Under Canadian GAAP, tax rate 

changes are recorded in income in the period the tax rate change is 

substantively enacted.
(n) Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
Effective November 1, 2009, we adopted the new United States guidance 

on non-controlling interests in subsidiaries issued by the Financial 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes
168
 BMO Financial Group 193rd Annual Report 2010 
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Under this new standard, all 
non-controlling interests held by parties other than the parent entity are 

reported as equity for United States GAAP reporting purposes. Under 
Canadian GAAP, all non-controlling interests are reported as other liabilities.
A continuity of non-controlling interest recorded in equity for 
the years ended October 31, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:

 (222)Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, October 31, 2010
  2,138(o) Other-than-Temporary Impairment
Effective May 1, 2009, we adopted the new FASB guidance that amended 

the impairment assessment and recognition principles of other-than-
temporary impairment for debt securities and enhanced the presentation
 and disclosure requirements for debt and equity securities. Under the new
 guidance, if a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporarily 

impaired, the amount of the impairment charge equal to the credit loss 

will be recorded in income and the remaining impairment charge will 
be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under Canadian
 GAAP, all impairment is recorded in income.
As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, we recorded a 
cumulative-effect adjustment to reclassify $24 million before tax ($16 mil-

lion after tax) from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive 
income as of May 1, 2009 for United States GAAP reporting purposes.
During the year ended October 31, 2010, we recorded total other-than-
temporary impairment losses of $36 million after taxes of $15 million 

($351 million after taxes of $113 million in 2009), of which $34 million 
($339 million in 2009) were recorded in income and $2 million ($12 million 
in 2009) were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
A continuity of the credit losses recorded in income before tax 
on available-for-sale debt securities held at year end is as follows:

 (3) (13)Reduction for securities that were sold or

 41 23Balance, end of year
  (286) (286)Under Canadian GAAP, impairment losses recorded against net income 
relating to an available-for-sale debt security may be reversed through 

net income if the fair value of the 
security increases in a subsequent 
period and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring 

after the impairment loss was recognized in net income. This is not 

permitted under United States GAAP.
(p) Business Combinations
Under United States GAAP, acquisition-related costs, except costs to issue 
debt or equity securities, are recorded as expenses in the period in which
 the costs are incurred. Under Canadian GAAP, acquisition-related costs 

are included in the cost of the purchase.
(q) Software Development Costs
Under United States GAAP, costs of internally developed software are 

required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life 
of the software. Under Canadian GAAP, prior to November 1, 2003, 
only costs related to internally developed software paid to third parties 

were capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the 

software. Effective November 1, 2003, we adopted a new Canadian 

accounting standard that eliminated this difference for software develop-

ment costs incurred after October 31, 2003. There was an adjustment 
to our Consolidated Statement of Income in the periods before fiscal 2009, 
when the software development costs capitalized prior to fiscal 2004 
were fully amortized.
(r) Restricted Net Assets
Certain of our subsidiaries and equity investments are subject to regula-
tory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, 

these subsidiaries and equity investees may be restricted from transferring 
to us our proportionate share of their 
assets in the form of cash dividends, 
loans or advances. At October 31, 2010 and 2009, restricted net assets 

of these subsidiaries were $6.2 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.
Changes in Accounting Policy
Convertible Debt Instruments
Effective November 1, 2009, new guidance was issued by the FASB 

on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled 
in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settle-
ment. This new guidance requires that we account for the liability 
and equity components separately. This guidance did not have any impact 
on our United States GAAP reconciliation because we do not have any 
convertible debt instruments, as all of our convertible preferred shares 
and capital trust securities are cl
assified as equity instruments under 
United States GAAP. 
Future Changes in Accounting Policy
Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets
The FASB has issued a new standard on the accounting for transfers of 

financial assets that removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose 

entity (“QSPE”). The new standard also creates more stringent conditions 

for reporting the transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale. 

This standard will impact some of the mortgages and credit card receiv-

ables we securitize to QSPEs. These QSPEs will be consolidated under 

the new guidance on the Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (see 

below). This standard is effective November 1, 2010 for United States 

GAAP reporting purposes. 
Amendments to Guidance on the Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
The FASB has issued a new standard that changes the criteria by which 

an enterprise determines whether it must consolidate a variable interest 

entity (“VIE”). This new standard amends the existing guidance to require 
an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if it has both the power to direct the 
activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance 
and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from 

the VIE. Existing guidance requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE 
if it absorbs a majority of the expected losses or residual returns, or both. 
A continuous assessment of which party must consolidate a VIE will 
be required, rather than an assessment only when certain trigger events 

occur. In addition, the new standard requires an enterprise to assess if 
VIEs that were previously QSPEs must be consolidated by the enterprise. 
We have not finalized our assessment of the impact associated with 

this amendment. This standard is effective Novem 
ber 1, 2010 for United 
States GAAP reporting purposes. 
Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses
The FASB has issued new disclosure requirements that increase the level 

of disclosure about the credit quality of loans and receivables and the 

allowance held against them. This guidance requires the bank to provide 

greater levels of dis 
aggregation for existing credit loss information. 
Other new disclosures include aging of past due receivables, credit quality
 information such as credit risk scores or external credit agency ratings, 

and the modification of our financing receivables. This requirement is 

effective November 1, 2010 for United States GAAP reporting purposes.

GLOSSARY
Allowance for Credit Losses
 represents an amount deemed 
adequate by management to absorb 

credit-related losses on loans and 

acceptances and other credit instru-

ments. Allowances for credit losses 

can be specific or general and are 

recorded on the balance sheet as a 

deduction from loans and acceptances 

or, as they relate to credit instruments, 

as other liabilities.
P 37, 81, 120
 Assets under Administration 

and under Management
 refers to 

assets administered or managed by 

a financial institution that are benefi-

cially owned by clients and therefore 

not reported on the balance sheet 

of the administering or managing 

financial institution.
Asset-Backed Commercial Paper 
(ABCP)
 is a short-term investment 

with a maturity that is typically less 

than 180 days. The commercial paper 

is backed by physical assets such 

as trade receivables, and is generally 

used for short-term financing needs.
Assets-to-Capital Multiple
 is defined as assets plus guarantees 

and letters of credit, net of specified 

deductions (or adjusted assets), 

divided by total capital.
Average Earning Assets
 represents 
the daily or monthly average balance 

of deposits with other banks and loans 

and securities, over a one-year period.
Bankers’ Acceptances (BAs)
 are 
bills of exchange or negotiable 
instruments drawn by a borrower for 
payment at maturity and accepted 

by a bank. BAs constitute a guarantee 

of payment by the bank and can 

be traded in the money market. 

The bank earns a “stamping fee” 

for providing this guarantee. 
Basis Point: 
One one-hundredth 
of a percentage point. 
Business Risk 
arises from the specific 
business activities of a company 

and the effects these could have 

on its earnings.
P 88
  Credit and Counterparty Risk 
is the 
potential for loss due to the failure 

of a borrower, endorser, guarantor 

or counterparty to repay a loan or 

honour another predetermined 

financial obligation.
P 80
 Derivatives 
are contracts whose 
value is “derived” from movements 

in interest or foreign exchange rates, 

or equity or commodity prices. 

Derivatives allow for the transfer, 
Forwards are customized contracts 

transacted in the over-the-counter 

market. Futures are transacted in 

standardized amounts on regulated 

exchanges and are subject to daily 

cash margining.
P 130
 General Allowance
 is maintained 
to cover impairment in the existing 

credit portfolio that cannot yet be 

associated with specific credit assets. 

Our approach to establishing and 

maintaining the general allowance is 

based on the guideline issued by our 

regulator, OSFI. The general allowance 

is reviewed on a quarterly basis and 

a number of factors are considered 

when determining its appropriate 

level. We employ a general allowance 

model that applies historical expected 

and unexpected loss rates, based on 

probabilities of default and loss given 

default factors, to current balances.
P 40, 81, 120
 Hedging is a risk management tech-
nique used to neutralize or manage 

interest rate, foreign currency, equity, 

commodity or credit exposures arising 

from normal banking activities. 
Impaired Loans
 are loans for 
which there is no longer reasonable 

assurance of the timely collection 

of principal or interest.
Innovative Tier 1 Capital:
 OSFI allows banks to issue instruments that 
qualify as “Innovative” Tier 1 capital. 

In order to qualify, these instruments 

must be issued indirectly through a 

special purpose vehicle, be perma-

nent in nature and receive acceptable 

accounting treatment. Innovative 

Tier 1 capital cannot comprise more 

than 20% of net Tier 1 capital, at time 

of issue, with 15% qualifying as Tier 1 

capital and the remaining 5% included 

in total capital.
Insurance Risk
 is the risk of loss 
due to actual experience being 
different than that assumed when 

an insurance product was designed 

and priced. 
Insurance risk exists 
in all our insurance businesses, 

including annuities and life, 
accident 
and sickness, and creditor insurance, 

as well as our reinsurance business.
Issuer Risk
 arises in BMO’s trading 
and underwriting portfolios, and 
measures the adverse impact of credit 

spread, credit migration and default 

risks on the market value of fixed 

income instruments and similar 
securities. Issuer risk is measured 
at a 99% confidence level over a 

specified holding period.
P 82
 modification or reduction of current or 

expected risks from changes in rates 

and prices.
Dividend Payout Ratio: 
Common 
dividends as a percentage of 
net income after preferred share 

dividends. 
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
 is calculated by dividing net income, 
after deduction of preferred dividends, 

by the average number of common 

shares outstanding. Diluted EPS, 

which is our basis for measuring 

performance, adjusts for possible 

conversions of financial instruments 

into common shares if those 

conversions would reduce EPS.
P 33, 156
 Earnings Volatility (EV)
 is a measure 
of the adverse impact of potential 

changes in market parameters on 

the projected 12-month after-tax 

net income of a portfolio of assets, 

liabilities and off-balance sheet posi-

tions, measured at a 99% confidence 

level over a specified holding period.
P 82
 Economic Capital
 is our internal 
assessment of the risks underlying 

BMO’s business activities. It represents 

management’s estimation of the 

likely magnitude of economic losses 

that could occur if adverse situations 

arise, and allows returns to be 

adjusted for risks. Economic capital 

is calculated for various types of 

risk 
Œ credit, market (trading and non-
trading), operational and business 
Œ where measures are based on a time 

horizon of one year. (For further dis-

cussion of these risks, refer to the 

Enterprise-Wide Risk Management 

section on page 75.) Economic capital 

is a key element of our risk-based 

capital management process.
P 34, 91
 Environmental Risk
 is the risk of 
loss or damage to BMO’s reputation 

resulting from environmental concerns 

related to BMO or its customers. 

Environmental risk is often associated 

with credit and operational risk.
P 90
 Fair Value
 is the amount of consider-
ation that would be agreed upon in 

an arm’s length transaction between 

knowledgeable, willing parties who 

are under no compulsion to act.
Forwards and Futures
 are contractual 
agreements to either buy or sell 
a specified amount of a currency, 

commodity, interest-rate-sensitive 

financial instrument or security at a 

specific price and date in the future. 
Liquidity and Funding Risk
 is the potential for loss if BMO is unable 

to meet financial commitments in a 

timely manner at reasonable prices as 

they fall due. Financial commitments 

include liabilities to depositors and 

suppliers, and lending, investment 

and pledging commitments.
P 85, 124
 Mark-to-Market
 represents the 
valuation of securities and derivatives 

at market rates as of the balance 

sheet date, where required by 

accounting rules.
Market Risk
 is the potential for a 
negative impact on the balance sheet 
and/or income statement resulting 

from adverse changes in the value 
of financial instruments as a result of 
changes in certain market variables. 

These variables include interest rates, 

foreign exchange rates, equity and 

commodity prices and their implied 

volatilities, as well as credit spreads, 

credit migration and default.
P 82, 124
 Market Value Exposure (MVE)
 is a measure of the adverse impact of 

changes in market parameters on the 

market value of a portfolio of assets, 

liabilities and off-balance sheet posi-

tions, measured at a 99% confidence 

level over a specified holding period. 

The holding period considers current 

market conditions and the composition 

of the portfolios to determine how 

long it would take to neutralize the 

market risk without adversely affecting 

market prices. For trading and under-

writing activities, MVE is comprised of 

Value at Risk and Issuer Risk.
P 82
 Model Risk is the potential loss due 
to the risk of a model not performing 

or capturing risk as designed. It also 

arises from the possibility of the 

use of an inappro 
priate model or 
the inappropriate use of a model.
Net Economic Profit (NEP)
 represents 
cash net income available to common 

shareholders, less a charge for 

capital. NEP is an effective measure 

of economic value added. NEP is a 

non-GAAP measure.
P 34, 91
 Net Interest Income
 is comprised 

of earnings on assets, such as loans 

and securities, including interest and 

dividend income and BMO’s share of 

income from investments accounted 

for using the equity method of 

accounting, less interest expense 

paid on liabilities, such as deposits.

arrangements offered to clients, which 

include credit derivatives, written put 

options, backstop liquidity facilities, 

standby letters of credit, performance 

guarantees, credit enhancements, 

commitments to extend credit, 

securities lending, documentary 

and commercial letters of credit, 

and other indemnifications.
Operating Leverage
 is the difference 
between revenue and expense 
growth rates. Cash operating leverage 

is the difference between revenue 

and cash-based expense growth rates.
P 27
 Operational Risk
 is the potential 
for loss resulting from inadequate or 

failed internal processes or systems, 

human interactions or external events, 

but excludes business risk.
P 87
 Options
 are contractual agreements 
that convey to the buyer the right 

but not the obligation to either buy or 

sell a specified amount of a currency, 

commodity, interest-rate-sensitive 

financial instrument or security at a 

fixed future date or at any time within 

a fixed future period.
P 130
 Productivity Ratio (or Expense-to-

Revenue Ratio or Efficiency Ratio)

is our key measure of productivity. 

It is calculated as non-interest 

expense divided by total revenues, 

expressed as a percentage. The cash 

productivity ratio is calculated in the 

same manner, after removing the 

amortization of acquisition-related 

intangible assets from non-interest 

expenses.
P 41, 91
 Provision for Credit Losses
 is a charge to income that represents 

an amount deemed adequate by 

management to fully provide for 

impairment in loans and acceptances 

and other credit instruments, given 

the composition of the portfolios, the 

probability of default, the economic 
rate payments based on a notional 

value of a single commodity.
•  Credit default swaps 
Œ one counter-

party pays the other a fee in 

exchange for that other counterparty 

agreeing to make a payment 

if a credit event occurs, such as 

bankruptcy or failure to pay.
•  Cross-currency interest rate swaps 
Œ fixed and floating rate interest 

payments and principal amounts are 

exchanged in different currencies.
•  Cross-currency swaps 
Œ fixed rate 
interest payments and principal 

amounts are exchanged in different 

currencies.
•  Equity swaps 
Œ counterparties 

exchange the return on an equity 

security or a group of equity 

securities for the return based on 

a fixed or floating interest rate or 

the return on another equity security 

or group of equity securities.
•  Interest rate swaps 
Œ counterparties 

generally exchange fixed and float-

ing rate interest payments based on 

a notional value in a single currency.
P 130
 Tangible Common Equity
 reflects 

common equity net of certain deduc-

tions. There is no standard industry 

definition of this measure.
P 60
 Tangible Common Equity to Risk-

Weighted Assets Ratio
 represents 
tangible common equity divided by 

risk-weighted assets.
P 60
 Taxable Equivalent Basis (teb):
 Rev-
enues of operating groups reflected in 

our MD&A are presented on a taxable 

equivalent basis (teb). The teb adjust-

ment increases GAAP revenues and 

the provision for income taxes by an 

amount that would increase revenues 

on certain tax-exempt securities to a 

level that would incur tax at the statu-

tory rate, to facilitate comparisons.
P 37
 Tier 1 Capital
 represents more per-

manent forms of capital, and primarily 

consists of common shareholders’ 

equity, preferred shares and innova-

tive hybrid instruments, less a deduc-

tion for goodwill and excess intangible 

assets and certain other deductions 

required under Basel II.
Tier 1 Capital Ratio
 is defined as 
Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted 

assets.
P 60, 147
 environment and the allowance for 

credit losses already established.
P 40, 81, 120
 Regulatory Risk 
is the risk of 
not complying with regulatory 

requirements, regulatory change 

or regulators’ expectations. Failing 

to properly manage regulatory 

risk may result in regulatory sanctions 

being imposed and could harm 

our reputation.
Reputation Risk
 is the risk of a 
negative impact to BMO that results 
from the deterioration of BMO’s 

reputation among stakeholders. 

These potential impacts include 

revenue loss, reduced client loyalty, 

litigation, regulatory sanction or 

additional oversight, and declines 

in BMO’s share price.
P 90
 Return on Equity or Return on 

Common Shareholders’ Equity (ROE)
 is calculated as net income, less 

preferred dividends, as a percentage 

of average common shareholders’ 

equity. Common shareholders’ equity 

is comprised of common share capital, 

contributed surplus, accumulated 

other comprehensive income (loss) 

and retained earnings.
P 34
 Securities Borrowed or Purchased 

under Resale Agreements
 are 
low-cost, low-risk instruments, often 

supported by the pledge of cash 

collateral, which arise from trans-

actions that involve the borrowing 

or purchasing of securities.
Securities Lent or Sold under 
Repurchase Agreements
 are 
low-cost, low-risk liabilities, often 

supported by cash collateral, which 

arise from transactions that involve 

the lending or selling of securities.
Specific Allowances
 reduce the 
carrying value of specific credit assets 
to the amount we expect to recover 

if there is evidence of deterioration 

in credit quality.
P 40, 81, 120
 Strategic Risk
 is the potential for 
loss due to fluctuations in the external 

business environment and/or failure to 

property respond to these fluctuations 

due to inaction, ineffective strategies 

or poor implementation of strategies.
Swaps
 are contractual agreements 

between two parties to exchange 

a series of cash flows. The various 

swap agreements that we enter into 

are as follows: 
•  Commodity swaps 
Œ counterparties 
generally exchange fixed and floating 
Total Capital
 includes Tier 1 and 

Tier 2 capital, net of certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital is primarily comprised of 

subordinated debentures and the eligi-

ble portion of the general allowance 

for credit losses. Deductions from Tier 2 

capital are primarily comprised of our 

investments in non-consolidated subsid-

iaries and other substantial investments.
Total Capital Ratio
 is defined as total 

capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
P 60, 147
 Total Shareholder Return (TSR): 
The five-year average annual total share-

holder return (TSR) represents the 

average annual total return earned on 

an investment in BMO common shares 

made at the beginning of a five-year 

period. The return includes the change 

in share price and assumes that divi-

dends received were reinvested in 

additional common shares. The one-

year TSR also assumes that dividends 

were reinvested in shares.
P 32
 Trading-Related Revenues
 include 
net interest income and non-interest 

revenue earned from on- and off-

balance sheet positions undertaken 

for trading purposes. The manage-

ment of these positions typically 

includes marking them to market 

on a daily basis. Trading revenues 

include income (expense) and gains 

(losses) from both cash instruments 

and interest rate, foreign exchange 

(including spot positions), equity, 

commodity and credit contracts.
P 39
 Value at Risk (VaR)
 is measured for 
specific classes of risk in BMO’s trading 

and underwriting activities: interest 

rate, foreign exchange rate, equity and 

commodity prices and their implied 

volatilities. This measure calculates the 

maximum likely loss from portfolios, 

measured at a 99% confidence level 

over a specified holding period.
P 82
 Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
 include entities with equity that is 

considered insufficient to finance the 
entity’s activities or in which the equity-
holders do not have a controlling 

financial interest. We are required to 

consolidate VIEs if the investments we 

hold in these entities and/or the rela-

tionships we have with them result 

in us being exposed to the majority 

of their expected losses and/or 

being able to benefit from a majority 

of their expected residual returns, 

based on a calculation determined 

by standard setters.
