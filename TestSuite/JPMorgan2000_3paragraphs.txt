JP Morgan 2000 The year 2000 was pivotal in the history of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. – the year we created a new and dynamic financial services platform with significant long-term, competitive advantages and growth opportunities. In wholesale banking, our strategy over the past decade has been shaped by the strong belief that the winning models will combine the best of a commercial bank with the best of an investment bank. The mergers completed over the past year provide the elements for long-term success. Scale in terms of capital, clients and products delivered globally – JPMorgan Chase has in excess of $42 billion in equity capital. The firm has relationships with more than 5,000 primary corporate clients with a balanced footprint across North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. And JPMorgan Chase now has leadership positions in the full spectrum of products to serve our clients globally.
