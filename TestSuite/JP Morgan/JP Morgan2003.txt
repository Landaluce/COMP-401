2J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Dear fellow shareholders
The announced J.P.Morgan Chase & Co.merger with Bank One
On January 14,2004,we announced our decision to merge with Bank One.We are excited about the
merger,and although it does not affect our results for 2003,I wanted to begin my report to you with an

overview of our new firm.This merger will create a firm with leadership positions in both wholesale and retail,a more balanced
earnings stream,greater scale and financial strength.From both a strategic and a people perspective,we

believe the combination is complementary and compelling.We were pleased that the rating agencies

reacted favorably after the announcement of the merger.
For 2003,the firms combined would have earned over $9 billion.The earnings,on a combined basis,
would have been almost evenly split between wholesale businesses and retail.The merger will further

strengthen our existing leadership positions in wholesale banking,providing even greater scale in terms 

of both clients and capital.In retail banking,we will be the second-largest U.S.credit card issuer and 

the second-largest U.S.bank based upon core deposits,with assets of over $1 trillion.From coast to 

coast,we will provide mortgages,auto loans and credit cards,and welcome customers into more than 

2,300 bank branches in 17 states.
Our new firm will have a complete financial services platform,providing the full range of retail and 
wholesale products.We anticipate the merger will close by mid-year 2004,and you can expect more 

information in the near future regarding our shareholder meeting.The bottom line is that we believe 

the new J.P.Morgan Chase & Co.will create tremendous shareholder value in 2004 and beyond.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
3Against the backdrop of an improving economy and a favorable turnin the credit cycle,JPMorgan Chase outperformed its peers by most

measures.Among major investment and commercial banks,we ranked

first in total return to shareholders.
2003 year in review
In 2003,our focus was on delivering results.As I said in the closing
words of my 2002 letter to shareholders,ÒWe have the right model,

the right strategy,and the right people ...What we need now is better

performance and improved execution.That will be the unrelenting 

focus of JPMorgan Chase in 2003.Ó
Our focus on results was evident in our much improved financial 
performance.
On an operating basis in 2003,we delivered:

¥ Higher revenuesÐup 13% from 2002,to $35.1 billion
¥ Higher earningsÐ$6.7 billion,compared with $3.4 billion in 2002
¥ A return on average common equity of 16%,compared with 
8% in 2002  
Against the backdrop of an improving economy and a favorable turn 
in the credit cycle,JPMorgan Chase outperformed its peers by most

measures.Among major investment and commercial banks,we ranked

first in total return to shareholders.We strengthened our leadership

positions in key product areas across all of our businesses.We delivered

greater value,in more ways,to a growing number of clients.
Throughout 2003,JPMorgan Chase also recognized the need to 
rebuild trust in financial institutions,including our own.We revised 

and enhanced our internal risk management processes and policies,

providing better oversight of complex financial transactions and 

greater transparency in our financial disclosures.We have also

embraced new regulations in the U.S.from Congress,the Securities 

and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange 

strengthening governance.
I want to take this opportunity 
to thank Larry Fuller,who has retired
from the Board of Directors,for 
his contributionsto our 
firm since 1985.We have benefited greatly from the wisdom and experience of ourboard members,and we wish Larry well.
Here is a look at how our major businessesperformed in 2003.The Investment Bankdemonstrated the value of its global scale,
diverse issuer and investor client franchise,and integrated business

model to deliver a record $3.7 billion in earnings.We achieved 

significant gains in revenues (up 16%) and substantial reductions 
in credit costs,resulting in a gain in earnings of 183% and a 

return on equity (ROE) of 19% for the year.
The Investment BankÕs impressive showing was driven by strong 
equity underwriting,increased capital markets revenues,and record

total return revenues in Global Treasury.
Our success in 2003 was also based upon our intellectual capital,
innovation and expertise in risk management.It is our ability to under-

stand our clientsÕ needs and then execute extraordinarily well that 

helpsus win in the mark
etplace.A very good example of our client focus
is our creation of the first-ever transferable employee stock option 

program for Microsoft.
In terms of the outlook for the Investment Bank,we are well positioned
for the next phase of the economic cycle.From 2002 to 2003,we

moved from #8 to #4 in Global Equity and Equity-Related,and we

maintained our #5 position in Global Announced M&A while increasing

our market share.We also continued to rank #1 in Interest Rate and

Credit Derivatives as well as in Global Loan Syndications.Even with the

anticipated shift in market activity,we believe our fixed income 

businesses will continue to flourish.More than half of our revenues 

are from investor clients who regularly need to adjust their portfolios.

This activity creates a solid foundation for ongoing business and continued growth.We are a truly global investment bank,delivering the breadth of the
firmÕs capabilitiesÐtailored to the needs of clients in local markets.

We continue to perform well in the Europe,Middle East and Africa
(EMEA) region,where the Investment Bank generated approximately

$1.3 billion in after-tax earnings.We are the only firm in the EMEA

region to finish 2003 ranked #5 or better across the equity,M&A,loan
and bond markets.We w
ant to be the most global of the Europeaninvestment banks,and the most European of the global investment

banks.We enjoy strong leadership positions in Latin America,and our

franchise in Asia presents significant growth opportunities for us.
With the completeness and scale of our capabilities,a commitment 
to innovation,and a client franchise that includes strong relationships

with over 90% of Fortune 500 companies and equivalent global 

penetration,the Investment Bank is well positioned to compete at 

the highest level around the world.Treasury & Securities Services(TSS),which provides financial 
transaction processing and information services to wholesale clients,

delivered attractive returns in 2003,generating an ROE of 19%.

Though affected by the downturn in capital markets and low interest
rates,TSS has provided a stable source of revenue year after year,
taking full advantage of its global scale,technological sophistication

and market leadership.Each of the three TSS businessesÐTreasury

Services,Investor Services and Institutional Trust ServicesÐis among

the top three in the world.4J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
I believe that a high-performance culture is the critical differentiatorthat separates the great enterprises from those that are merely good,
and that separates enduring success from transitory achievement.We remain committed to extending those leadership positions.Two
recent acquisitionsÐan electronic payments subsidiary of Citigroup and

Bank OneÕs corporate trust businessÐare expected to enhance consid-

erably TSSÕs revenue growth rate in 2004.(It is important to note that

Bank One sold its trust business because it lacked the scale and global

scope that JPMorgan Chase has in this business.) TSS will continue 

to drive for greater scale,productivity gains and higher service quality

levels to maintain its market leadership.
Investment Management & Private Banking(IMPB) showedstrong momentum in 2003,generating 
earnings of $268 million.Pre-taxmargins improved significantly throughout the year and assets under
supervision increased 18% to $758 billion.During the year,IMPB made

substantial progress in its execution on three key goals.Investment 

performance improved,particularly in key U.S.institutional equity and

fixed income products.The Private Bank successfully executed its

growth strategy as client assets and product usage increased year over

year.Additionally,credit costs were lowered by nearly 60% compared

to 2002.And lastly,IMPB advanced its U.S.retail strategy by acquiring

full ownership of J.P.Morgan | American Century Retirement Plan

Services with $41 billion in 401(k) plan assets.Aligning Retirement Plan

Services and BrownCo,our online brokerage service,to build an IRA

roll-over capability positions IMPB well to benefit from the growing
individual retirement market.
JPMorgan Partners
(JPMP),our private equity business,has invested
in a wide range of companies in diverse sectors,stages and locations.

JPMPÕs primary investment vehicle is its $6.5 billion Global Fund,which

invests on behalf of the firm and third-party investors.JPMPÕs financial

performance improved substantially over the year.In 2004 and beyond,

JPMP should benefit from a continued recovery in equity financing 
and M&A activities.
Chase Financial Services(CFS),our retail and middle market 
businesses,improved upon their very strong 2002 results with record 

revenues and earnings in 2003,producing an ROE of 28%.
As the result of its focus on national consumer credit businesses,CFS
has established a unique franchise that has enabled it to deliver strong

results.It is a market leader in all three major national consumer credit

businessesÐthe only top-five performer across mortgage origination

and servicing,credit cards and auto finance.
Chase Home Finance had a record year in 2003,coming off excellent
results in 2002.On all fronts,Home Finance took advantage of the

mortgage boom,resulting in an increase in revenues of 38% over

2002.The quality of execution was key to its success,as the business

managed record volumes while maintaining high customer servicestandards.Chase Cardmember Services grew outstandings despite 
balance paydowns due to consumer liquidity resulting from the mortgage
refinancing boom.Chase Auto Finance also had a record number of

originations and increased its market share.
In addition to our national consumer credit businesses,our other CFS
businessesÐChase Regional Banking and Chase Middle MarketÐhave

shown significant growth in deposits,up 8% and 17% respectively,

despite the low interest rate environment,which compressed spreads,

reducing revenue for the year.
In the still fragmented retail banking industry,CFSÕs businesses focused
on competitive differentiators,such as productivity and marketing

enhancements.We have seen gains from disciplined expense manage-

ment and from greater efficiency.CFS has also boosted the quality of

its marketing efforts,resulting in progress in cross-selling products 

and services.We invested in businesses such as home equity,where we 
achieved significant increases in outstandings.Personal Financial

Services,our br
anch-based business offering banking and investing servicesto upper-
tier retail customers,continues to gain momentum,having
increased new investment fee-based sales by 63% and bringing assets
under management to a total of $10.7 billion.In 2004,CFS expects to operate at lower but still robust ROE levels,
caused by our expectation that the mortgage business will return to
more normal conditions.CFS will focus on stable credit quality,

productivity gains,innovative marketing and cross-selling initiatives,

and continued investment in growth opportunities to improve its 
competitive position.Disciplined risk managementThe improvement in our performance was enhanced by better execution
in risk management.
In the two years following the merger that created JPMorgan Chase(that is,in 2001 and 2002),our performance suffered from three main

challenges,none of them principally related to the merger:excessive

capital committed to private equity;over-concentration of loans to

telecommunications companies;and large exposure to Enron.
We dealt decisively with each issue in 2003.We reduced our exposure
to private equity to 15% of the firmÕs common stockholdersÕ equity 

at the end of 2003 (down from a peak of 29% in 2000).We moved 

to put Enron behind us through the settlement that our firm and 
others reached in 2003 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other regulatory and governmental entities.We reduced commercial

credit exposure and drove substantial reductions in single-name and
industry concentrations.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
5We are beginning to recognize the power and potential of our greatstrategic platform.Clearly,our clients and customers like the value we

add in both our wholesale and retail businesses.
Commercial criticized exposure (rated CCC+/Caa1 and lower) and 
non-performing loans were both down over 45% from the beginning
of the year.Our provision for commercial credit losses was down by

$2.8 billion.The risk profile of the firm has improved,and our bottom

line results are much better.
Building a great culture
I believe that a high-performance culture is the critical differentiator
that separates the great enterprises from those that are merely good,

and that separates enduring success from transitory achievement.
Business units continued to emphasize increased productivity andimproved quality.In 2003,our productivity and quality efforts yielded

more than $1 billion pre-tax in net financial benefits,more than dou-

bling those achieved in 2002.Over one-half of these benefits came

from re-engineering key business processes using the disciplined meth-

odology of Six Sigma.We used Six Sigma in several key areas,includ-

ing enhancing our customersÕ experience and removing costs from our 
larger and more complex operations.
The challenge has been the blending of key attributes of the cultures 
of our predecessor firms into a new model.We are focused on develop-

ing a culture based on integrity,respect,excellence and innovation,

where diversity and differences are recognized and valued,and leader-

ship development and managing talent are hallmarks of our firm.Our work on establishing a high-performance culture will continueas

we complete the merger with Bank One.
The firmÕs efforts to build a strong culture have also focused on encour-
aging a spirit of giving back to the communities where we live and 
do business.We are proud that the firm has maintained a consistent

ÒoutstandingÓCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating,and we are

committed to partnering with our communities around the world to
make a  positive difference.Our employees have developed a great 

spiritof giving 
back,not just in monetary terms,but also through volun-
teeringtheir time and talents to their communities.
2004:Still about strategy and delivering results
We are beginning to recognize the power and potential of our greatstrategic platform.Clearly,our clients and customers like the value we

add in both our wholesale and retail businesses.
In wholesale banking,our capabilities reach across all important product
sets,clients and locations Ð from the Americas to Europe,Asia,the

Middle East and Africa.We have the competitive advantage of scale
and completeness,and we remain focused on integrated delivery to
serve our clients well.There is ample room for organic growth and

development in providing premier global wholesale financial services.

In other areas,such as Institutional Trust Services,we may choose to

augment our skills through tactical acquisitions.For the most part,

however,our wholesale banking business will grow through better 

execution in deliveringthe whole firm to a highly sophisticated andglobal client base at multiple points of need.The retail banking landscape presents a different picture.It is large 
andstill relatively fragmented,even after a decade of consolidation.

Almost certainly,consolidation will continue and gather pace in years

to come.With Bank One,we will significantly extend our retail finan-

cialservices platform and be better positioned to take advantage of 

the enormous opportunities before us.
The strategic model we have adopted,with extensive leadership positions
in both wholesale and retail financial services,provides great balance

to our growth,returns and diversification.
Confidence in the future
With the strategic platform we created three years ago,the mergerwith

Bank One,and the progress we have made toward building a high-

performance culture,we have to prove that we can consistently produce

superior results,and that we are disciplined in how we use our capital.

We also have to demonstrate a seamless integration with Bank One 
so that we add value from day one.
I have every confidence that we can accomplish these goals.

In 2004 as in 2003,the unrelenting focus of our firm will be on results
and performance.

WyethJPMorgan Chase believes in strong corporate 
governance practices,starting with the Board of 

Directors and continuing throughout the firm.Board governance
The Board of Directors focused on corporate governance issuesthroughout 2003 and plans to continue this focus as part of the 
integration process in the firmÕs proposed merger with Bank One.

The board of the post-merger company will seek to bring the best of both predecessors to the combined firmÕs corporate 

governance practices.
During 2003,the board reviewed its corporate governance practices
and committee charters in light of SEC-approved New York Stock

Exchange listing standards,applicable regulatory requirements and

best practices.In November,the board spent a full day discussing

corporate governance issues with leading experts.Topics covered

included risk management,financial disclosure,audit quality,the role

of the compensation committee,fiduciary duties of directors,the

board evaluation process and the integrity of the U.S.financial markets.
Based on its work in 2003,in January 2004 the board approved 
revisions to its corporate governance practices and committee charters.

These are available at the firmÕs website,www.jpmorganchase.com.
The boardÕs new structure and practices address the following:
¥effective size:The current Board of Directors has 12 members.
Following the merger,the board will have 16 members,eight from
Bank One and eight from JPMorgan Chase.
¥a super-majority of non-management directors:There is currently
one management member on the JPMorgan Chase board,William

Harrison.Following the merger,only two management members

will be on the board,Mr.Harrison and James Dimon.
¥director independence:independent directors:Each of the non-management directors ofJPMorgan Chase was determined by the board to be independent

in accordance with board standards that consider past and current
employment relationships;any business relationships with or 

charitable contributions to entities at which a director serves as
an officer;and personal banking and other financial relationships,

which must be on an armÕs-length basis.
executive sessions of directors:Directors meet periodically withoutmanagement.Additionally,non-management directors meet in

executive session,without management directors,at least twice a

year:once to review the CEOÕs performance,and once to review

the board and its corporate governance practices.
access to outside resources:Although the main responsibility for providing assistance to the board rests with management,
the board and board committees can engage outside expert 
advice from sources independent of management at the expense
of the firm.resu

Board of Directors
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
7Primary responsibility for adherence to the policies and proceduresdesigned to address reputation risk lies with business units,which

are also required to submit,to regional Policy Review Committees,

proposed transactions that may heighten reputation risk.The com-

mittees may approve,reject or require further clarification of or

changes to the transactions,or they may escalate the review to the

most senior level of review,the Policy Review Office.The objective of

the policy review process is to reinforce a culture that ensures that
all employees understand the basic principles of reputation risk con-
trol and recognizes and addresses issues as they arise.For a further

description of the policy review process,see the discussion of Reput-

ation and Fiduciary risk starting at page 73 of this Annual Report.
The firm has two codes of conduct,one applying to all employees
and a supplementary code that applies to senior executive and 
senior financial officers.The Worldwide Rules of Conduct,a code of

conduct and business ethics,is applicable to all employees and,as

modified by applicable addenda,to directors.In 2003,the firm added

a Code of Ethics for senior executive and senior financial officers to
underscore the importance of ethical conduct and compliance with
the law,particularly as it relates to the maintenance of the firmÕs

financialbooks 
and records and the preparation of its financial state-ments.A copy of the Worldwide Rules is available by contacting 

the Office of the Secretary.The Code of Ethics for senior executive

officers and senior financial officers is available at the firmÕs website.
Alignment with shareholders
Good corporate governance requires that compensation policies
align with shareholder interests.JPMorgan ChaseÕs compensation

policy for executive officers emphasizes performance-based pay over
fixed salary and uses equity-based awards to align the interests of

executive officers with shareholders.Members of the Office of the

Chairman and other members of the firmÕs Executive Committee are

required to retain 75% of the net shares of stock received from stock
grants and options (after deductions for taxes and options exercise
costs).The board believes it is desirable that a significant portion of

overall director compensation be linked to JPMorgan Chase stock;

the boardÕs total compensation includes approximately one-third

cash and two-thirds stock-based compensation in the form of share
equivalents that must be held until a directorÕs termination of service.
In 2002,the firm committed to expense stock options beginning 
in January 2003.The firm made this commitment in partnership with

other large,diversified financial services firms,in the belief that

investors should expect consistency across the industry.For a descrip-

tion of employee stock-based incentives and the expensing of stock
options,see Note 7 beginning on page 93 of this Annual Report.
Governance was an important consideration in JPMorgan ChaseÕs
proposed merger with Bank One.The post-merger board structure

described above was intended to provide for continuity within

change.The chair of the Governance Committee of JPMorgan Chase

and the chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Com-
mittee of Bank One will lead efforts within their respective boards to
determine the continuing directors from each respective board,who

in turn will form the board of the post-merger company.The result 

of this process will be a highly independent and competent board
providing oversight and direction for the merged company.
Internal governanceJPMorgan Chase is a large,complex enterprise with multiple lines of

business and a large number of subsidiaries within and outside the
United States.Each of the firmÕs businesses and subsidiaries must be

operated in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to
it.While governance begins with the Board of Directors,managing

the enterprise requires effective governance structures and practices
throughout the organization.The firm as a whole manages by line of business,supported by 
global policies and standards that typically apply to all relevant units

regardless of geography or legal structure.The strength of these 

global control processes is the foundation of regional and individual
subsidiary governance.Three examples of the firmÕs global processes

and standards are its risk management structure,policy review

process and codes of conduct.Defined risk governance is a principle of risk management atJPMorgan Chase.The Board of Directors exercises oversight of 

risk management through the board as a whole and through the 
boardÕs Risk Policy and Audit Committees.The charters of these 

and other board committees are available at the firmÕs website
(www.jpmorganchase.com).T
he board delegates the formulation of policy and day-to-day risk oversight and management to the 
Office of the Chairman and to two corporate risk committees,

the Capital Committee and the Risk Management Committee.The

Office of the Chairman is responsible for the formulation of major
policies and the review of major risk exposures.The Capital Com-

mittee focuses on capital planning,internal capital allocation and 

liquidity management.The focus of the Risk Management Com-

mittee includes,among others,credit risk,market risk and opera-

tional risk.A discussion of Risk and Capital management begins 

at page 45 of this Annual Report.
The policy review process is based on the recognition that a firmÕs
success depends not only on its prudent management of the risks
mentioned above,but equally on the maintenance of its reputation

for business practices of the highest quality,among many constituents

Ðclients,investors,and regulators,as well as the general public.

9results:what they mean to usAfter the tumult of 2001 and 2002,many
who look back at 2003 will call it a transi-
tional year for JPMorgan Chase and the
broader market.Bill,how well do you think

the firm did overall,in sticking to its core

goals and executing against them?We drove superior results by executing con-sistently on our strategy.The way you succeed

in challenging,ever-changing markets is to

have,first,depth of product and expertise;

second,leadership positions across your

businesses;and third,integrated delivery.In

2003 we demonstrated significant progress
on all of these fronts.And importantly,we

did this while dramatically reducing concen-
trations and risk in our credit and private

equity portfolios.
David,Wall Street began to show renewed
vitality in 2003.How did JPMorganÕs whole-

sale businesses deliver for clients last yearÐ

particularly across products?Simply put,our success results from our 
integrated business model.We have a diverse

and global issuer and investor client franchise.

Our scale,completeness and ability to inno-

vate allow us to provide our clients with integrated advice and solutions to meet their
needs.You saw it in our transaction with

Microsoft,the first-ever transferable employee

stock option program.You also saw it in the

new instruments we structured for our
investor clients,such as equity default swaps

and equity collateralized obligationsÐa new

asset class.And you saw it in solutions we

developed for our sophisticated private bank-

ing and investment management clients.

These solutions reflect,respond to and even
anticipate client needs.
Don,the last couple of years have set the 
bar very high for the retail businesses.How

can we build upon this success and sustain
growth into the future?The return to normalcy in the mortgageindustry,with the refinancing wave abating,

will allow the credit card industry to return 
to its traditional levels of revenue growth,in

which we will participate from a position 
of strength,enhanced by our merger.And,

not incidentally,we will still be a top-ranked

player in a mortgage business that continues
to be very strong,even if off from its height.

Chase Auto Finance has incredible long-term

momentum in growing share and therefore
profits.And with interest rate declines over,

our deposit-intensive businesses,regional

banking and middle market,will be translat-

ing their recent strong deposit volume growth
into revenue and profit improvement.As liquidity and stability return to the finan-cial markets,Bill,how do you see JPMorgan

Chase maintaining its leadership and beating
the benchmarks?Now that weÕve delivered significantlyimproved performance across the board,we

enter 2004 in a position of strength:number

one,two or three in each of our major 

business segments.And with the Bank One

merger,we have the scale and business 

mix to be a market leader.
The merger will bring benefits to both ourclients and our shareholders.The union of

our commercial and investment banking
franchise with Bank OneÕs huge consumer

banking presence gives us an even broader
platform from which to serve the client.Also,

the merger creates a more balanced firm
with more consistent earnings,which we feel

can only enhance shareholder value.
David,with markets rebounding and firms
bracing for a renewed flurry of client 
activity,how will the wholesale businesses

look to not only capitalize but also build 
on their strengths?ItÕs all about leveraging our competitive
advantage.We will focus our investments

where we believe we have competitive
advantages and market economics are

attractive,and we will recycle capital from

areas that are not as attractive.We believe

we are the most integrated firmÐwith some

8,000 wholesale clients worldwide,our issuer

and investor franchises have never been
broader or deeper.This is a reflection of our

leadership and a tremendous competitive
advantage as we look to capture an ever-

greater share of our clientsÕ business.
Chairman William B.Harrison and Vice Chairmen David A.Coulter and Donald H.Layton talk about 
what shaped the firmÕs results for 2003 and prospects for the future.
Don,Chase Financial Services had such a
great year in 2002Ðwith profits up 64%Ð

that market expectations were that profits in

2003 would decrease.What was behind 

their further increase in 2003?The record performance at Chase HomeFinance cannot be overstated and was defi-
nitely the biggest driver.I also would high-

light the growth of our best-in-class auto
finance business.The credit card business

will more than double in size with the Bank
One merger,giving us the leading scale so

important to success in the card industry.

Our deposit-intensive businesses were,of

course,depressed by the yearÕs ultra-low

interest rates.The fundamental strength of

these franchises was shown by Middle

Market still increasing profits slightly due to

superb credit performance,and Regional

Banking growing deposits strongly,which

positions us well for the future.
results:delivering for clientsWe deliver value to our shareholders by delivering for our clients.Clients come to JPMorgan Chase 
with financial problems that have broad implications,not only for their entire organizations but for the 

financial markets themselves.Problems like these require innovative solutionsÐmeeting unprecedented 

levels of consumer demand for financing,and helping companies grow.The right solution is more 

than effective,it is transformational:turning growing companies into global leaders,endowing leading 

companies with eminent influence.
Supporting client goals:Panamerican Beverages,Inc.
Continuing a long-standing,multifaceted relationship with Panamerican Beverages,Inc.
(Panamco),JPMorgan acted as the Latin American bottlerÕs exclusive financial advisor in a

landmark transaction.Panamco was acquired by Coca-Cola FEMSA in the largest transaction ever in the Mexican
beverage sector.The landmark sale solidified PanamcoÕs leadership in the consolidating 

global beverage industry and created the leading bottler of Coca-Cola products in Latin
America and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world.Meeting unparalleled demand:Chase Home Finance
The 2003 U.S.real estate and home-finance markets were best described as explosive.Remarkably
strong new-home construction starts,combined with plummeting interest rates,encouraged

first-time home buyers not only to make purchases but also to raise the bar on their spending

parameters.Existing homeowners added to the critical mass by fueling a record-setting 

refinancing boom.Client demand for mortgage services skyrocketed,and 
Chase Home Finance 
ramped up operationsto meet the need.Applications for the year totaled more than $295 billionÐin particular,the

month of June produced an all-time high.Total revenues for the year exceeded $4 billion,up 38%

over 2002 levels.
Capitalizing on expanding markets:Ripplewood Holdings
Ripplewood HoldingsÕ acquisition of Japan Telecom Co Ltd.ÐAsiaÕs largest-ever LBO transac-

tionÐwas a milestone in the development of the regionÕs leveraged buyout market.JPMorgan

ChaseÕs advisory and financing role in this transaction was critical to RipplewoodÕs completion

of the acquisition and underscores the firmÕs leadership in the region.
JPMorgan served as the financial advisor to U.S.-based Ripplewood,one of the leading private
equity investors in Japan.The firm also served as lead arranger for the acquisition financing.
The highly visible transaction was not only an enormous landmark for the market,it also 
contributed to an improvement in the Asian financial markets.
10J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Setting a global benchmark:KfW
When Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW),a German government development 
agency,decided to issue an equity-linked bond offering,it selected JPMorgan 

as one of two bookrunners.The 
5 billion offering proved to be the largest of its kind by any issuer globally.This landmark transaction 

by JPMorganÕs EMEA equity business confirmed JPMorganÕs 

position as the #1 equity-linked house.
Realizing client vision:News Corp.
In a complex transaction that reshaped the U.S.media landscape,News Corp.,assisted by

JPMorgan,acquired a 34% interest in Hughes Electronics.The $6.6 billion purchase comple-

mented News Corp.Õs 
existing global pay-TV platform with a significant U.S.presence.
Following the acquisition,the media giant became the second-largest provider of pay-TV 
service in the U.S.,with more than 11 million subscribers.
As one of the leading providers of banking and advisory services to News Corp.,JPMorgan
was the natural choice to advise on this landmark transaction.Creating innovative solutions:Microsoft
Market reaction was swift and enthusiastic when JPMorgan announced a groundbreaking
solution enabling Microsoft to offer its employees cash for stock options that had no market

valueÐwithout incurring cost to the company.
Microsoft management and employees,Wall Street analysts and leaders of other companies
all applauded this novel transaction,which allowed Microsoft employees to sell their 

ÒunderwaterÓstock options to JPMorgan.Fully half of all eligible employees subscribed to

the offer,resulting in the largest equity derivative or option sale ever executed.
This was a one-of-a-kind transaction.The offering incorporated solutions for complex 
legal,tax and accounting issues.Consequently,JPMorgan is seeking U.S.patent 

protection on the concept and process.
11results:collaborating across businesses
Delivering outstanding results requires partnershipÐwith clients and with colleagues.A truly effective firm 
possesses expertise across all functions,and integrates those functions seamlessly.JPMorgan Chase boasts this

winning combination:deep,varied expertise,residing in multiple areas of the firm,fused for the benefit of our

clients.When we partner across business unitsÐharnessing our combined ideas,experience,knowledge and

resourcesÐthe results are powerful.Exponential benefits accrue:to our clients,who get comprehensive and

innovative solutions;to our employees,who continually broaden their knowledge and stimulate their creativity;

and to our firm,which fortifies its leadership across markets,solidifying its position as the full-service financial

firm of choice.
Mobilizing wide-ranging expertise:acquisition of ProSiebenSat.1
The acquisition of leading German television broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG required 
a far-reaching suite of services.JPMorgan Chase helped provide those services to an investor

group headed by Saban Capital Group Inc.and including Bain Capital,LLC,Hellman &

Friedman LLC,Thomas H.Lee Company,Providence Equity Partners Inc.,Quadrangle Group
LLC and Alpine Equity Partners L.P.
Based on relationships with the JPMorgan Private Bank,the investor group called upon the
firmÕs Investment Bank for financial advice.This complex transaction called for proven exper-

tise in mergers and acquisitions,debt and equity origination,private equity,foreign exchange

and banking and operational services,as well as in-depth knowledge of the U.S.,U.K.and

German regulatory and industry environments.
JPMorgan delivered high-quality advice and execution on multiple fronts,enabling the clients
to complete this highly complex transaction in a short timeframe.
Building unique service combinations:Asia Pacific financial institution
No fewer than 12 JPMorgan Chase businesses,involving six legal entities in five countries,

came together in record time to create a unique,customized global service for one of the

largest investors in the world.Based in Asia Pacific,this financial institution required a broad array of advisory and execution
services.In structuring this solution,JPMorgan drew upon the expertise in its Investment Bank,

particularly the Credit and Rates group,as well as Treasury & Securities Services,in several 

locations around the world.The unique solution the firm provided combined existing services in a way that has not yet been
replicated by any competitor.The firm secured an agreement to manage a portfolio of more

than $8 billion.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
13Providing multi-business solutions:Dell Inc.
DellÕs relationship with JPMorgan Chase,as both a supplier and a valued client,spans nearly
two decades.From 1986,when the Middle Market Banking group set up a line of credit to

help the fast-growing young computer companyÕs operations,JPMorgan Chase teams have

progressively broadened the services provided,keeping pace with DellÕs business development

and asset management needs.
Recently,teams from across the firm collaborated to help Dell manage its cash position.
Today,the portfolio of services provided to Dell includes asset management,cash management,
custody and other investor services,trustee,foreign exchange and investment banking.
Accessing firmwide resources:Prudential Financial
For more than 80 years,JPMorgan has worked with insurance industry leader Prudential
Financial to understand the breadth of its needs and provide tailored solutions integrating arange of products and services.From investment banking to foreign exchange trading,cash

management,custody and other investor services,JPMorgan has provided Prudential with

sophisticated global solutions.
In 2003,JPMorganÕs firmwide relationship team worked with the insurer to craft a compre-
hensive solution for its securities custody and cash management needs.As a result,the firm

secured a mandate to act as custodian for a $140 billion asset portfolio and will serve as
clearing agent for all associated cash concentration and payments business.
Augo financieHarnessing financing know-how:the clients of Chase Auto Finance
Providing nearly $28 billion of auto financing in 2003,Chase Auto Finance (CAF) distinguished
itself as an industry leader.Collaborating with other groups in the firm,CAF goes beyond 

traditional automotive financing and provides creative business solutions to a wide range of
customers in the automotive industry.
CAF partners with the Investment Bank and the Middle Market Banking group to help dealer
group clients improve their bottom lines,offering products and services such as basic loans,

revolving credit facilitiesÐeven,when appropriate,high-yield bond issues.Partnerships with

Chase Merchant Services and Chase Home Finance enable dealer customers to obtain credit

cards and credit card processing and to offer home financing as an employee benefit.These cross-business partnerships enabled CAF to achieve a third-place ranking in 2003 loanoriginations,behind only General Motors Acceptance Corp.and Ford Motor Credit Co.

results:positioning the firm for growth
We have found that market leadership and customer satisfaction go hand in hand.ThatÕs why positioning for
growth is an essential part of our strategyÐour own,and our clientsÕ.We are relentless in building on the

strengths of the JPMorgan Chase franchise to expand our leadership,both in market share and in client satis-

faction.The pending Bank One merger will help us achieve these goals:complementing our strengths,giving us

the scale to be a market-leading financial firm,and giving us a broader platform from which to serve our

clients.We continue to pursue growth in countless ways:acquiring complementary businesses,capitalizing on

current positions,even helping to expand global markets.
Acquiring complementary businesses:Treasury & Securities Services
JPMorgan ChaseÕs Treasury & Securities Services (TSS) is augmenting its global leadership
position and the growth of its three core businessesÐTreasury Services,Investor Services and

Institutional Trust ServicesÐwith targeted acquisitions.
The acquisition strategy begun six years ago by Institutional Trust Services has been applied
across the three businesses and resulted in seven acquisitions signed in 2003.In businesses

where economy of scale is critical to success,TSS took a major step in 2003 with the acquisi-

tion of Bank OneÕs corporate trust business,which enhanced a franchise that was already the

#1 trustee for U.S.corporate debt.TSS also seeks out acquisitions that will expand its global
reach and complement its traditional product offering.The acquisition of Citicorp Electronic

Financial Services meets both of these objectives,extending Treasury ServicesÕ core cash man-
agement and payments offerings into digitized prepaid stored value cards,and positioning

TSS for expansion into public- and private-sector markets globally.
Creating a unique offering:Personal Financial Services
Combining two of the firmÕs hallmark strengthsÐbanking expertise from Chase and investing

expertise from JPMorganÐChase Personal Financial Services (PFS) meets market demand for a

unique,integrated approach to banking and investing for affluent individuals.
Launched early in 2003,PFS offers advice and solutions across a range of areas for affluent
clients:financial planning,education funding,retirement planning,tailored banking and

investing,and insurance.As part of its distinctive approach,PFSÕs services and resources are

offered through traditional banking branches and over the telephone,as well as in specialized

locations.Clients work with a dedicated banker and advisor team that provides tailored financial

advice and solutions.They also have access to Personal Line,an around-the-clock phone 

servicing unit,and to PFS Online,which provides integrated banking and investing capability.

In 2003,Personal Financial Services served 433,000 clients with deposit and investment 

assets of $54 billion.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
15Building on momentum:Chase Home Finance
With an 82% increase in originations between 2002 and 2003,Chase Home Finance (CHF) met record demand for residential

mortgages.Now,building on this strong momentum,CHF is

prepared to meet a different kind of demand when interest
rates plateau or rise:the demand for home equity lending.

With appealing interest rates and no closing costs,home

equity loans have become an attractive financing option for
consumers seeking cash-flow flexibility.
Having prepared for this change in market dynamics through-
out the past few yearsÕ mortgage boom,CHF enters the

anticipated higher-rate environment with a significant com-

petitive advantage.From 2001 to 2003,CHF moved from 

#11 in market share to #7 in Home Equity,and the firm has
set a goal to become by 2005 a top-three playerin market

share and customer satisfactionÐwhile maintaining its 

outstanding credit and overall quality record.Enabling client transformation:Amersham PLC
JPMorgan advised on one of last yearÕs top transformational deals,as U.K.-based Amersham,
a world leader in pharmaceutical diagnostics,agreed to merge with General ElectricÕs 

Medical Systems.
The $10 billion transactionÐthe largest ever all-equity offer by a U.S.company for a U.K.
firm Ðwill create a global leader in healthcare technologies.
For U.S.corporate leader GE,the deal was historically important,its second-largest equity 
offering ever.In the U.K.market,the deal stood out as the yearÕs largest recommended offer

as well as the largest transatlantic deal.Developing a leadership position in a growing market:
U.S.retail asset managementDefined contribution and IRA are the fastest-growing asset segments within the hugeÐand 
rapidly growingÐU.S.retail asset management market.JPMorgan Chase is positioned to 

capitalize on this marketÕs explosive growth by aligning JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services 

and BrownCo to offer mainstream U.S.retail investors a simpler,smarter way to roll over 

IRA accounts.
JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services is a recognized innovator in personalized corporate retire-
ment planning to plan sponsors and individual participants,providing top-quality investment

products,401(k) administration,record-keeping and advisory services.BrownCo is a leader in

discount brokerageÐrated #1 consistently by GŠmez Brokerage Research in overall cost,rated

#2 by J.D.Power and Associates in its 2003 online investor satisfaction survey,and named a
ForbesBest of the Web pick (Winter 2003).
results:building a high-performance culture
Building a client-focused,leadership-driven ethos demands constant self-evaluation,self-reinforcement and
fresh thinking.Toward that end,the firm has initiated several programs that aim to drive best-of-breed execution

and disciplined business improvement.When it comes to improving our businessÐand our approach to doing 

itÐour job is never complete.
t comes to improving our business Ð and our approach to doing it Ð our job isnever complete.
Productivity & Quality/Six Sigma
Using disciplined methodologies such as Six Sigma,our employees streamlined key business
processes and increased savings in 2003.From transforming the client credit review process,

which improved risk management and profitability in the Investment Bank,to improving 

the process of identifying potential customers for credit card offers,the firmÕs broad-ranging 

productivity and quality efforts yielded more than $1 billion in net financial benefitsÐmore

than doubling the benefits achieved the previous year.
LeadershipMorganChase
Two years ago,the firm implemented LeadershipMorganChase (LMC) to help develop a
stronger corporate culture and further develop the firmÕs leaders through a focus on values,

partnership,communication and performance.More than 60,000 employees worldwide,

from all five lines of business,have participated.
One outgrowth of LMC in 2003 was the Knowledge Broker Network,an internal network of
more than 80 individuals across the firm that makes it simpler to determine whom to call 

to better serve customers and generate incremental revenue.These efforts have led to stronger

client relationships and successful execution of revenue-generating activities.
JPMorgan Chase Poll
Annually,JPMorgan Chase polls its employees to assess their understanding of the firmÕs 

strategy;commitment to the firm;partnership with colleagues;and perceptions of the firmÕs

efforts in diversity,work-life balance and leadership.
Some 95% of employees worldwide completed the 2003 poll,and commitment to the firm is
exceedingly high:91% of respondents are willing to put in an effort beyond normal expec-

tations to get the job done.Strides in diversity continue,with 76% of employees believing that

the firmÕs focus and efforts will make the company even stronger.Finally,at 71%,overall 

satisfaction with the firm ranks well above external benchmarks.Areas for improvement included

continual enhancements to technology processes and services,and flexible work arrangements.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
17and making our communities thriveJPMorgan Chase vigorously supports the development and prosperity of the communities it serves.Committing
time,money and creativity,the firm and its employees make a difference at crucial development stages for 

cultural and human-services organizations;countries and societies;and individuals.Our efforts support human

services and education providers,sponsor artistic and cultural endeavors,make homeownership possible for

minorities and spur sustainable economic developmentÐall necessary ingredients to help communities flourish.
Realizing dreams:minority homeownership
In the United States today,fewer than 50% of minority households and other under-served
markets own their homes,while just under 70% of the total population are homeowners.The

Chase Dream Maker Commitment
SM,a 10-year,$500 billion initiative by Chase Home Finance
(CHF),helps those who aspire to homeownership to achieve their dreamÐsustainably.
The Chase Dream Maker Commitment
SMinitiative provides more than capital.Through seminars
and other financial-education programs,CHF provides greater access to information about the

mortgage process and promotes homeownership as a prudent wealth-building investment.This initiativeÐ
which in its first three years has already originated $182 billion of its total 10-yearcommitmentÐis helping to make the American dream a reality for thousands of Americans.
Fostering a rebirth:South Africa initiatives
In 2003,JPMorgan Chase helped advance South AfricaÕs transformation into a thriving,first-
world economy by providing financial advice,resources and capital to companies,organiza-

tions,schools and individuals in the region.
A prime example was the firmÕs advisory role in Harmony Gold Mining Co.Õs sale of a 10% equity
stake.The transaction made Harmony the leading black-empowered South African gold mining

company,and it cemented JPMorganÕs position as the leading M&A advisor in South Africa.
JPMorgan Chase also continued its support of South African charitable organizations.Through
our local foundation,The JPMorgan South Africa Foundation,the firm provided $486,000 to

charities offering aid for education,HIV,the elderly and the disabled.
Establishing leadership:corporate philanthropy
From supporting pre-collegiate education to assisting with the economic empowerment ofwomen,the J.P.Morgan Chase Foundation reached out to the firmÕs many communities through

its 2003 philanthropic programs.
Grants and recoverable grants to the Low Income Investment Fund helped capitalize the con-struction and expansion of childcare facilities in New York and California.Foundation contribu-

tions to Pro Mujer bolstered that organizationÕs work with entrepreneurial women in Peru 

and Mexico.Another grant helped Freedom from Hunger provide small cash loans and health

and nutrition education to women living in rural areas of the developing world.The examples are international,the theme universal:the foundation was a valuable partner 
in strengthening the global community.
JPMorgan Partners (JPMP),the firmÕs global private equity organization,provides equity and
mezzanine capital financing to private companies.It is a diversified investor,investing in

buyouts,growth equity and venture opportunities across a variety of industry sectors,with

the objective of creating long-term value for the firm and third-party investors.

and services to consumers and small and middle market businesses throughout the United

through Chase Regional Banking and Chase Middle Market.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
22J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
OverviewJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is a leading global finan-
cial services firm with assets of $771 billion and

operations in more than 50 countries. The Firm

serves more than 30 million consumers nationwide

through its retail businesses, and many of the

world's most prominent corporate, institutional

and government clients through its global whole-

sale businesses.Total Noninterest expense was $21.7 billion, down 5% from the
prior year. In 2002, the Firm recorded $1.3 billion of charges, princi-

pally for Enron-related surety litigation and the establishment of lit-

igation reserves; and $1.2 billion for Merger and restructuring costs
related to programs announced prior to January 1, 2002. Excluding
these costs, expenses rose by 7% in 2003, reflecting higher per-

formance-related incentives; increased costs related to stock-based

compensation and pension and other postretirement expenses; and

higher occupancy expenses. The Firm began expensing stock
options in 2003. Restructuring costs associated with initiatives
announced after January 1, 2002, were recorded in their relevant

expense categories and totaled $630 million in 2003, down 29%
from 2002.
The 2003 Provision for credit losses of $1.5 billion was down
$2.8 billion, or 64%, from 2002. The provision was lower than

total net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, reflecting significant

improvement in the quality of the commercial loan portfolio.

Commercial nonperforming assets and criticized exposure levels

declined 42% and 47%, respectively, from December 31, 2002.

Consumer credit quality remained stable.
Earnings per diluted share (ÒEPSÓ) for the year were $3.24, an
increase of 305% over the EPS of $0.80 reported in 2002.

Results in 2002 were provided on both a reported basis and an

operating basis, which excluded Merger and restructuring costs

and special items. Operating EPS in 2002 was $1.66. See page
28 of this Annual Report for a reconciliation between reported

and operating EPS.Summary of segment results
The FirmÕs wholesale businesses are known globally as

ÒJPMorgan,Ó and its national consumer and middle market busi-
nesses are known as ÒChase.Ó The wholesale businesses com-

prise four segments: the Investment Bank(ÒIBÓ), Treasury &Securities Services(ÒTSSÓ), Investment Management &Private Banking(ÒIMPBÓ) and JPMorgan Partners(ÒJPMPÓ).IB provides a full range of investment banking and commercial

banking products and services, including advising on corporate

strategy and structure, capital raising, risk management, and

market-making in cash securities and derivative instruments in all
major capital markets. The three businesses within TSS provide

debt servicing, securities custody and related functions, and

treasury and cash management services to corporations, financial

institutions and governments. The IMPB business provides invest-

ment management services to institutional investors, high net
worth individuals and retail customers and also provides person-

alized advice and solutions to wealthy individuals and families.

JPMP, the FirmÕs private equity business, provides equity and mez-

zanine capital financing to private companies. The FirmÕs national

consumer and middle market businesses, which provide lending

and full-service banking to consumers and small and middle mar-
ket businesses, comprise Chase Financial Services(ÒCFSÓ).Financial performance of JPMorgan ChaseAs of or for the year ended December 31,(in millions,except per share and ratio data)

In 2003, global growth strengthened relative to the prior two
years. The U.S. economy improved significantly, supported by

diminishing geopolitical uncertainties, new tax relief, strong

profit growth, low interest rates and a rising stock market.

Productivity at U.S. businesses continued to grow at an extraor-

dinary pace, as a result of ongoing investment in information

technologies. Profit margins rose to levels not seen in a long

time. New hiring remained tepid, but signs of an improving job

market emerged late in the year. Inflation fell to the lowest level

in more than 40 years, and the Board of Governors of the

Federal Reserve System (the ÒFederal Reserve BoardÓ) declared

that its long-run goal of price stability had been achieved.
Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (ÒJPMorgan
ChaseÓ or the ÒFirmÓ) reported 2003 Net income of $6.7 bil-

lion, compared with Net income of $1.7 billion in 2002. All five

of the FirmÕs lines of business benefited from the improved eco-

nomic conditions, with each reporting increased revenue over

2002. In particular, the lowÐinterest rate environment drove

robust fixed income markets and an unprecedented mortgage
refinancing boom, resulting in record earnings in the Investment
Bank and Chase Financial Services. Total revenue for 2003 was $33.3 billion, up 12% from 2002.
The Investment BankÕs revenue increased by approximately 

$1.9 billion from 2002, and Chase Financial ServicesÕ revenue

was $14.6 billion in 2003, another record year.
The table above shows JPMorgan ChaseÕs segment results. These
results reflect the manner in which the FirmÕs financial informa-
tion is currently evaluated by management and is presented on

an operating basis. Prior-period segment results have been

adjusted to reflect alignment of management accounting policies

or changes in organizational structure among businesses. 
IBreported record earnings of $3.7 billion for 2003, up 183%
from 2002, driven by strong growth in capital markets revenues

and equity underwriting fees, coupled with a significant decline
in credit costs. The lowÐinterest-rate environment, improvement

in equity markets and volatility in credit markets produced

increased client and portfolio management revenue in fixed

income and equities, as well as strong returns in Global Treasury.

Market-share gains in equity underwriting contributed to the

increase in Investment banking fees over 2002. IBÕs return on

allocated capital was 19% for the year.  
TSSearnings of $520 million for the year were down 16%
compared with 2002. Revenues were $4.0 billion for the full

year, up 3% from 2002. Institutional Trust Services and Treasury

Services posted single-digit revenue growth. Investor Services

revenue declined year-over-year but showed an improving trend
over the last four consecutive quarters. Return on allocated capi-

tal for TSS was 19% for the year. 
IMPBincreased earnings and assets under supervision in 2003.
Earnings of $268 million for the full year were up 3% from

2002, reflecting an improved credit portfolio, slightly higher rev-

enues and the benefits of managed expense growth. The

increase in revenues reflected the acquisition of Retirement Plan

Services, and increased average equity market valuations in

client portfolios and brokerage activity, mostly offset by the

impact of institutional net outflows. Investment performance in
core institutional products improved, with all major asset classes

in U.S. institutional fixed income and equities showing above-
benchmark results. Return on allocated capital was 5% for the

year; return on tangible allocated capital was 20%.
JPMPperformance improved significantly, with private equity
gains of $27 million, compared with private equity losses of

$733 million for 2002. Results for the direct investments portfo-

lio improved by $929 million from 2002, driven by realized gains

on sales and declining write-downs in the second half of 2003.JPMP revenue was impacted in 2003 by losses on sales and
writedowns of private third-party fund investments. JPMP

decreased its operating loss for the year by 64% compared 

with 2002. CFSposted record earnings of $2.5 billion, driven by record results
and origination volumes at each of the national credit businesses Ð

mortgage, credit card and auto. Record revenues for CFS of $14.6

billion were up 9% from 2002, driven by record revenues in Chase

Home Finance. Despite significant deposit growth, Chase Regional

Banking revenues decreased due to deposit spread compression.

CFSÕs return on allocated capital was 28% for the year.
In 2003, JPMorgan Chase revised its internal management
reporting policies to allocate certain revenues, expenses and tax-
related items that had been recorded within the Corporate seg-
ment to the other business segments. There was no impact on

the FirmÕs overall earnings.
For a discussion of the FirmÕs Segment results, see pages 27Ð44
of this Annual Report.Capital and liquidity managementJPMorgan Chase increased capital during 2003. At December 31,

2003, the FirmÕs Tier 1 capital was $43.2 billion, $5.6 billion higher

than at December 31, 2002. The Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% was

well in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines, it was 8.2% at

year-end 2002. The Firm maintained the quarterly dividend of $0.34

per share on its common stock. JPMorgan Chase did not r
epur-chase shares of its common stock in 2003. Management expects to

recommend to the Board of Directors that the Firm resume
its share
repurchase program after the completion of the pending merger
with Bank One Corporation (see Business events below).The FirmÕs liquidity management is designed to ensure sufficient
liquidity resources to meet all its obligations, both on- and

offÐbalance sheet, in a wide range of market environments. The

FirmÕs access to the unsecured funding markets is dependent

upon its credit rating. During 2003, the Firm maintained senior

debt ratings of AA-/Aa3/A+ at JPMorgan Chase Bank and
A+/A1/A+ at the parent holding company. Upon the announce-

ment of the proposed merger with Bank One Corporation,

MoodyÕs and Fitch placed the FirmÕs ratings on review for an

upgrade, and S&P affirmed all of the FirmÕs ratings. See Business
events below.
Risk management The Firm made substantial progress in lowering its risk profile in

2003.Total commercial credit exposure, which includes loans, deriva-
tive receivables, lending-related commitments and other assets,

declined by $30.2 billion, or 7%, from December 31, 2002.

Increased financings in the public markets, reduced loan

demand and loan sales drove the decline. In 2003, the Firm

implemented a more stringent exposure-review process and

lower absolute exposure limits for industry and single-name con-

centrations, including investment-grade obligors. The Firm was
also more active in managing commercial credit by selling higher-

risk loans and commitments and entering into single-name 
credit default swap hedges.
Total consumer loans on a managed basis, which includes bothreported and securitized loans, increased by $15.7 billion, or 10%,
from December 31, 2002. The consumer portfolio is predominantly

U.S.-based. The largest component, 1Ð4 family residential mort-

gage loans, which are primarily secured by first mortgages, com-

prised 43% of the total consumer portfolio at December 31, 2003.JPMPÕs private equity portfolio declined by 12% to $7.3 billion at
December 31, 2003, from $8.2 billion at December 31, 2002. 

At year-end 2003, the portfolio was diversified across industry sec-

tors and geographies Ð with a higher percentage invested in more

mature leveraged buyouts and a lower percentage in venture invest-

ments than at year-end 2002. The carrying value of JPMPÕs portfolio

has decreased year-over-year, consistent with managementÕs goal to

reduce, over time, the capital committed to private equity.
The Firm uses several tools, both statistical and nonstatistical, tomeasure market risk, including Value-at-Risk (ÒVARÓ), Risk identi-

fication for large exposures (ÒRIFLEÓ), economic value stress tests

and net interest income stress tests. The Firm calculates VAR daily

on its trading and nontrading activities. Average trading VAR

decreased for full-year 2003. The year-end trading VAR increased

compared with year-end 2002 due to higher VAR for equity

activities. In 2003, trading losses exceeded VAR on only one day,

a result that is consistent with the 99% confidence level.

Average, maximum, and December 31 nontrading VAR increased
in 2003, primarily due to the increase in market volatility during

the 2003 third quarter and to the rise in interest rates in the sec-

ond half of 2003. There was an additional day in 2003 in which

losses exceeded VAR; this was attributable to certain positions in

the mortgage banking business.The Firm is also committed to maintaining business practices ofthe highest quality. The Fiduciary Risk Committee is responsible

for overseeing that businesses providing investment or risk man-

agement products and services perform at the appropriate stan-

dard in their relationships with clients. In addition, the Policy

Review Office oversees the review of transactions with clients in

terms of appropriateness, ethical issues and reputation risk, with
the goal that these transactions are not used to mislead
investors or others.During the year, the Firm revised its capital allocation method-
ologies for credit, operational, business and private equity risk.

This resulted in the reallocation of capital among the risk cate-

gories and the business segments; the reallocation did not result

in a significant change in the amount of total capital allocated
to the business segments as a whole.For a further discussion of Risk management and the capital allo-cation methodology, see pages 45Ð74 of this Annual Report.
Business outlookGlobal economic conditions and financial markets activity are

expected to continue to improve in 2004. While rising interest

rates may negatively affect the mortgage and Global Treasury busi-

nesses; on the positive side, gains in market share, rising equity val-

ues and increased market activity may benefit many of the FirmÕs

other businesses.The Firm expects to see a different mix of earnings in 2004. IB is tar-
geting higher issuer and investor client revenue, but securities gains

and net interest income may be lower. Mortgage earnings are likely

to decline from the record set in 2003, and growth in other retail

businesses may not be sufficient to offset the decline in mortgage

revenue. Improved equity markets and increased M&A activity may
provide increased exit opportunities in private equity and could

result in higher fees in IMPB and in the custody business of TSS.Commercial net charge-off ratios may be lower, but credit costs

may rise as the reduction in the Allowance for credit losses slows.

The Firm expects stable consumer net charge-off ratios in 2004.  
Business eventsAgreement to merge with Bank One Corporation 
On January 14, 2004, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One Corporation
(ÒBank OneÓ) announced an agreement to merge. The merger

agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of

both companies, provides for a stock-for-stock merger in which

1.32 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock will be exchanged,

on a tax-free basis, for each share of Bank One common stock. 
The merged company, headquartered in New York, will be
known as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and will have combined

assets of $1.1 trillion, a strong capital base, 2,300 branches in

17 states and top-tier positions in retail banking and lending,

credit cards, investment banking, asset management, private

banking, treasury and securities services, middle markets and pri-

vate equity. It is expected that cost savings of $2.2 billion (pre-

tax) will be achieved over a three-year period. Merger-related

costs are expected to be $3 billion (pre-tax).
The merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of both
institutions as well as U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. regula-

tory authorities. It is expected to be completed in mid-2004. For further information concerning the merger, see Note 2 on
page 87 of this Annual Report.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
25Results of operationsThis section discusses JPMorgan ChaseÕs results 
of operations on a reported basis. The accompa-

nying financial data conforms with accounting

principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (ÒGAAPÓ) and prevailing industry

practices. The section should be read in conjunc-

tion with the Consolidated financial statements
and Notes to consolidated financial statements
beginning on page 82 of this Annual Report.
Investment banking feesInvestment banking fees of $2.9 billion rose 5% from 2002. 
For a discussion of Investment banking fees, which are primarily

recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 
29Ð31of 
thisAnnual Report.Trading revenueTrading revenue in 2003 of $4.4 billion was up 65% from the
prior year. Fixed income and equity capital markets activities drove

growth in both client and portfolio management revenues.

Portfolio management, in particular, was up significantly from

2002 as a result of gains in credit, foreign exchange and equity

derivatives activities. Trading revenue, on a reported basis,

excludes the impact of Net interest income (ÒNIIÓ) related to IBÕs

trading activities, which is reported in NII. However, the Firm

includes trading-related NII as part of Trading revenue for segment

reporting purposes to better assess the profitability of IBÕs trading
business. For additional information on Trading revenue, see IB

segment discussion on pages 29Ð31 of this Annual Report. Fees and commissions Fees and commissions of $10.7 billion in 2003 rose 3% from the

prior year as a result of higher credit card servicing fees associated

with $5.8 billion in growth in average securitized credit card receiv-

ables. Also contributing to the increase from 2002 were higher cus-

tody, institutional trust and other processing-related service fees.

These fees reflected the more favorable environment for debt and

equity activities. For a table showing the components of Fees and
commissions, see Note 4 on pages 88Ð89of this
 Annual Report.

Private equity gains (losses)Private equity gains of $33 million in 2003 reflect significant

improvement from losses of $746 million in 2002. For a discussion

of Private equity gains (losses), which are primarily recorded in

JPMP, see JPMP results on pages 36Ð37.
Securities gainsIn 2003, Securities gains of $1.4 billion declined 7% from the

prior year. The decline reflected lower gains realized from the

sale of government and agency securities in IB and mortgage-

backed securities in Chase Home Finance (ÒCHFÓ), driven by the
increasing interest rate environment beginning in the third quar-

ter of 2003. IB uses available-for-sale investment securities to

manage, in part, the asset/liability exposures of the Firm; CHF

uses these instruments to economically hedge the value of 
mortgage servicing rights (ÒMSRsÓ). For a further analysis of
securities gains, see IB and CHF on pages 29Ð31 and 39Ð40,
respectively, of this Annual Report.
Mortgage fees and related income  Mortgage fees and related income of $892 million in 2003 declined
10% from 2002. The decline reflects lower mortgage servicing fees

and lower revenues from MSR hedging activities; these were offset

by higher fees from origination and sales activity and other fees

derived from volume and market-share growth. Mortgage fees and

related income, on a reported basis, excludes the impact of NII and
securities gains and losses related to Chase Home FinanceÕs mort-

gage banking activities. For a further discussion of mortgage-related

revenue, see the segment discussion for Chase Home Finance onpages 39Ð40 and Note 4 on page 89 of this Annual Report. Other revenueOther revenue of $579 million in 2003 rose 26% from the prior

year. The increase was a result of $200 million in gains from the

sale of securities acquired in loan satisfactions (compared with $26

million in 2002), partly offset by lower net results from corporate

and bank-owned life insurance policies. Many other factors con-
tributed to the change from 2002, including $73 million of write-

downs taken in 2002 for several Latin American investments. Net interest incomeNII of $12.3 billion was 7% higher than in 2002. The increase

reflected the positive impact of lower interest rates on consumer
loan originations and related funding costs. Average mortgage

loans in CHF rose 32% to $74.1 billion, and average automobile

loans and leases in Chase Auto Finance increased 32% to 
ManagementÕs discussion and analysis

26J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
$41.7 billion. NII was reduced by a lower volume of commercial
loans and lower spreads on investment securities. As a compo-

nent of NII, trading-related net interest income of $2.1 billion

was up13% from 2002 due to a change in the composition of,
and growth in, trading assets.
The FirmÕs total average interest-earning assets in 2003 were
$590 billion, up 6% from the prior year. The net interest yield

on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.10%,
compared with 2.09% in the prior year.

Technology and communications expenseIn 2003, Technology and communications expense was 11%
above the prior-year level. The increase was primarily due to a

shift in expenses: costs that were previously associated with

Compensation and Other expenses shifted, upon the commence-
ment of the IBM outsourcing agreement, to Technology and

communications expense. Also contributing to the increase were

higher costs related to software amortization. For a further dis-

cussion of the IBMoutsourcing agreement, see Support Units

and Corporate on page 44 of this Annual Report.Other expenseOther expense in 2003 rose slightly from the prior year, reflecting

higher Outside services. For a table showing the components of
Other expense, see Note 8 on page 96 of this Annual Report.
Surety settlement and litigation reserve The Firm added $100 million to the Enron-related litigation

reserve in 2003 to supplement a $900 million reserve initially
recorded in 2002. The 2002 reserve was established to cover
Enron-related matters, as well as certain other material litigation,

proceedings and investigations in which the Firm is involved. In

addition, in 2002 the Firm recorded a charge of $400 million for

the settlement of Enron-related surety litigation.
Merger and restructuring costsMerger and restructuring costs related to business restructurings

announced after January 1, 2002, were recorded in their relevant

expense categories. In 2002, Merger and restructuring costs of

$1.2 billion, for programs announced prior to January 1, 2002,

were viewed by management as nonoperating expenses or 

Òspecial items.Ó Refer to Note 8 on pages 95Ð96 of this Annual
Report for a further discussion of Merger and restructuring costs

and for a summary, by expense category and business segment,

of costs incurred in 2003 and 2002 for programs announced

after January 1, 2002.Provision for credit losses The 2003 Provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion lower than in

2002, primarily reflecting continued improvement in the quality of

the commercial loan portfolio and a higher volume of credit card

securitizations. For further information about the Provision for

credit losses and the FirmÕs management of credit risk, see the dis-

cussions of net charge-offs associated with the commercial and

consumer loan portfolios and the Allowance for credit losses, on

pages 63Ð65 of this Annual Report. Income tax expense Income tax expense was $3.3 billion in 2003, compared with

$856 million in 2002. The effective tax rate in 2003 was 33%,
compared with 34% in 2002. The tax rate decline was principally

attributable to changes in the proportion of income subject to

state and local taxes. Compensation expenseCompensation expense in 2003 was 6% higher than in the prior
year. The increase principally reflected higher performance-related

incentives, and higher pension and other postretirement benefit

costs, primarily as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions. For

a detailed discussion of pension and other postretirement benefit

costs, see Note 6 on pages 89Ð93 of this Annual Report. The
increase pertaining to incentives included $266 million as a result

of adopting SFAS 123,and $120 million from the reversal in 2002

of previously accrued expenses for certain forfeitable key employ-

ee stock awards, as discussed in Note 7 on pages 93Ð95 of this

Annual Report. Total compensation expense declined as a result

of the transfer, beginning April 1, 2003, of 2,800 employees to

IBM in connection with a technology outsourcing agreement. The

total number of full-time equivalent employees at December 31,
2003 was 93,453 compared with 94,335 at the prior year-end.
Occupancy expense Occupancy expense of $1.9 billion rose 19% from 2002. The

increase reflected costs of additional leased space in midtown

Manhattan and in the South and Southwest regions of the

United States; higher real estate taxes in New York City; and 

the cost of enhanced safety measures. Also contributing to 

the increase were charges for unoccupied excess real estate 

of $270 million; this compared with $120 million in 2002, 

mostly in the third quarter of that year. 
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
27JPMorgan ChaseÕs lines of business are segmented based on the
products and services provided or the type of customer serviced

and reflect the manner in which financial information is currently

evaluated by the FirmÕs management. Revenues and expenses

directly associated with each segment are included in determin-

ing that segmentÕs results. Management accounting and other

policies exist to allocate those remaining expenses that are not

directly incurred by the segments.
OverviewThe wholesale businesses of JPMorgan Chase are known globally

as ÒJPMorganÓ and comprise the Investment Bank, Treasury &

Securities Services, Investment Management & Private Banking
and JPMorgan Partners. The national consumer and middle mar-
ket businesses are known as ÒChaseÓ and collectively comprise

Chase Financial Services.Basis of presentation
The Firm prepares its consolidated financial statements, which

appear on pages 82Ð85of this 
Annual Report, using U.S. GAAPand prevailing industry practices. The financial statements are pre-

sented on a Òreported basis,Ó which provides the reader with an

understanding of the FirmÕs results that can be consistently tracked

from year to year and enables a comparison of the FirmÕs perform-

ance with other companiesÕ U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the FirmÕs results on a reported basis,
management looks at results on an Òoperating basis,Ó which is a

non-GAAP financial measure, to assess each of its lines of busi-

ness and to measure overall Firm results against targeted goals.

The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S.

GAAP results and then excludes the impact of credit card securi-

tizations. Securitization does not change JPMorgan ChaseÕs

reported versus operating net income; however, it does affect the
classification of items in the Consolidated statement of income.
For a further discussion of credit card securitizations, see Chase

Cardmember Services on page 41 of this Annual Report.
Segment results
Prior to 2003, the Firm excluded from its operating results the

impact of merger and restructuring costs and special items, as

these transactions were viewed by management as not part of

the FirmÕs normal daily business operations or unusual in nature

and, therefore, not indicative of trends. To be considered a special

item, the nonrecurring gain or loss had to be at least $75 million

or more during 2002. Commencing in 2003, management deter-

mined that many of the costs previously considered nonoperating

were to be deemed operating costs. However, it is possible that in

the future, management may designate certain material gains or

losses incurred by the Firm to be Òspecial items.Ó
The segment results also reflect revenue- and expense-sharing
agreements between certain lines of business. Revenue and

expenses attributed to shared activities are recognized in each

line of business, and any double counting is eliminated at the
segment level. These arrangements promote cross-selling and

adjusted methodology, which quantifies credit, market, opera-

tional and business risks within each business and additionally,

for JPMP, private equity risk. For a discussion of those risks, see

the risk management sections on pages 45Ð74of 
this AnnualReport. The Firm allocates additional capital to its businesses

incorporating an Òasset capital taxÓ on managed assets and
some offÐbalance sheet instruments. In addition, businesses are

other intangibles generated through acquisitions. The Firm esti-
mates the portfolio effect on required economic capital based on

correlations of risk across risk categories. This estimated diversifi-

cation benefit is not allocated to the business segments.Performance measurement 
The Firm uses the shareholder value added (ÒSVAÓ) framework

to measure the performance of its business segments. To derive

SVA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for its business segments,

the Firm applies a 12% (after-tax) cost of capital to each seg-

ment, except JPMP Ð this business is charged a 15% (after-tax)

cost of capital. The capital elements and resultant capital charges

provide each business with the financial framework to evaluate the

trade-off between using capital versus its return to shareholders.
Capital charges are an integral part of the SVA measurement for
each business. Under the FirmÕs model, economic capital is either

underallocated or overallocated to the business segments, as
compared with the FirmÕs total common stockholdersÕ equity. The

revenue and SVA impact of this over/under allocation is reported
under Support Units and Corporate. See Glossary of terms on
page 131 of this Annual Report for a definition of SVA and page

44 of this Annual Report for more details.
JPMorgan ChaseÕs lines of business utilize individual perform-
ance metrics unique to the respective businesses to measure

their results versus those of their peers. For a further discussion

The 2003 performance of IB was positively influenced by a low inter-est-rate environment, a more favorable equities market and an

improving credit market, partially offset by continued weakness in

M&A activity. 
In 2003, IB reported record 
operating earnings
of $3.7 billion, anincrease of 183% compared with 2002. Revenue growth of 16%

far outpaced expense growth of 6%. Credit costs were negative

$181 million in 2003, compared with $2.4 billion in 2002. Return

on allocated capital for the year was 19%.Operating revenue
of $14.4 billion consisted of investmentbanking fees for advisory and underwriting services; capital mar-
kets revenue related to market-making, trading and investing; and

revenue from corporate lending activities.

Investment banking fees of $2.9 billion were up 6%. While
Advisory fees declined by 14%, reflecting depressed levels of

M&A activity, debt underwriting fees were up 2%. This 2%

increase is primarily due to growth in high yield underwriting and

structured finance fees and reflects a partial offset of lower loan

syndication fees. The key contributor to the overall increase in IB

fees was equity underwriting revenue, which was up 48%,

reflecting increases in market share and underwriting volumes.

ance by providing a diversification benefit to the FirmÕs trading,

revenue. These activities are managed on a total-return revenue
basis, which includes operating revenue plus the change in unre-

alized gains or losses on investment securities and hedges (includ-
ed in Other comprehensive income) and internally transfer-priced

assets and liabilities. Capital markets revenue includes client and

portfolio management revenues. Portfolio management reflects

net gains or losses from IBÕs proprietary trading and revenue from

risk positions in client-related market-making activities.
Capital markets and lending total-return revenue
of $11.6 billion was up 22% from last year due to strong client

and portfolio management revenue. Excluding Global Treasury,

Capital markets and lending total-return revenue was $9.9 bil-

lion, up 25% from the prior year.
Fixed income revenue of $7.0 billion was up 28% from last year.
The increase was driven by strong client driven activity in

European and emerging markets, as well as increased portfolio

management revenue in credit and foreign exchange markets.

average allocated capital by $712 million, and it increased share-
holder value added by $65 million.Business outlookIn 2004, the composition of IBÕs revenues is expected to change.

Growth in client-related revenue may be offset by potentially

lower securities gains and NII. NII may be lower due to decreased

spreads on investment securities and lower loan volumes. The IB

credit outlook is stable, although credit costs may be higher than

the unusually low levels seen in 2003.from last year, 
driven by positioning to benefit from interest rate
movements and mortgage basis volatility. Credit portfolio rev-
enue of $1.4 billion was down 6% the result of tightening of

credit spreads in the second quarter of 2003, as well as lower

NII, which reflected lower levels of commercial loans. Equities

revenue of $1.5 billion was up 51% from last year due to higher
client activity and portfolio management results in derivatives

and convertibles.Operating expenseincreased 6% from 2002, reflecting higher
incentives related to improved financial performance and the

impact of expensing stock options. Noncompensation costs were

up 4% from the prior year due to increases in technology and
occupancycosts. Severance and related costs of $347 million
were down 41%. The overhead ratio for 2003 was 59%, com-

pared with 64% in 2002.
Credit costs
were negative $181 million, $2.6 billion lower than
in the prior year, reflecting improvement in the overall credit

quality of the commercial portfolio and the restructuring of sev-

eral nonperforming commercial loans. 
Corporate credit allocation
In 2003, IB assigned to TSS pre-tax earnings and allocated capi-

tal associated with clients shared with TSS. Prior periods have

been revised to reflect this allocation. The impact to IB of this

change decreased pre-tax operating results by $36 million and

Treasury & Securities Services (ÒTSSÓ) operating earnings
decreased by 16% from 2002 while delivering a return on allo-

cated capital of 19%. Increased operating expense of 7% and

a lower corporate credit allocation contributed to the lower

earnings. 
Operating revenue
increased by 3%, with growth at
Institutional Trust Services (ÒITSÓ) of 7%. ITS revenue growth

came from debt product lines, increased volume in asset servic-

ing and the result of acquisitions which generated $29 million

of new revenue in 2003. Treasury ServicesÕ revenue rose 6% on

higher trade and commercial payment card revenue and

increased balance-related earnings, including higher balance

deficiency fees resulting from the lower interest rate environ-

ment. Investor ServicesÕ revenue contracted 4%, the result of

lower NII due to lower interest rates, coupled with lower foreign

exchange and securities lending revenue. 
TSS results included a pre-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of
a nonstrategic business in 2003, compared with a pre-tax gain

of $50 million on the sale of the FirmÕs interest in a non-U.S.

securities clearing firm in 2002. Operating expenseincreased by 7%, attributable to higher 
severance, the impact of acquisitions, the cost associated with
expensing of options, increased pension costs and charges to pro-

vide for losses on subletting unoccupied excess real estate. The

overhead ratio for TSS was 81%, compared with 77% in 2002.

33Corporate credit allocation
In 2003, TSS was assigned a corporate credit allocation of pre-

tax earnings and the associated capital related to certain credit

exposures managed within IBÕs credit portfolio on behalf of

clients shared with TSS. Prior periods have been revised to reflect

this allocation. For 2003, the impact to TSS of this change
increased pre-tax operating r
esults by $36 million and averageallocated capital by $712 million, and it decreased SVA by

$65 million. Pre-tax operating results were $46 million lower

than in 2002, reflecting lower loan volumes and higher related

expenses, slightly offset by a decrease in credit costs.
Business outlookTSS revenue in 2004 is expected to benefit from improved global

equity markets and from two recent acquisitions: the November

2003 acquisition of the Bank One corporate trust portfolio, and
the January 2004 acquisition of CitigroupÕs Electronic Funds

Services business. TSS also expects higher costs as it integrates
these acquisitions and continues strategic investments to sup-
port business expansion.By client segmentTSS dimensions of 2003 revenue diversification

market recovery, on a year-over-year basis, brought 2003Õs aver-

age annual market levels broadly back in line with 2002Õs aver-

age. Investment performance in core institutional products

improved with all major asset classes, with U.S. institutional fixed

income and equities markets showing above-benchmark results.
IMPBÕs 
operating earnings 
were 3% higher than in the prior
year, reflecting an improved credit portfolio, the benefits of

slightly higher revenues and managed expense growth. Quarterly

earnings increased sequentially during the year. During the sec-

ond quarter of 2003, the Firm acquired American Century

Retirement Plan Services Inc., a provider of defined contribution

recordkeeping services, as part of its strategy to grow its U.S.
retail investment management business. The business wasrenamed JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services (ÒRPSÓ). Return on
tangible allocated capital was 20%.Operating revenue
of $2.9 billion was 1% higher than in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher Fees and 

commissions and Net interest income. The growth in Fees and

commissions reflected the acquisition of RPS and increased aver-

age equity market valuations in client portfolios, partly offset by

institutional net outflows. The growth in Net interest income

reflected higher brokerage account balances and spreads. The
decline in all other revenue primarily reflected nonrecurring 

items in 2002.Operating expenseincreased by 3%, reflecting the acquisition
of RPS, higher compensation expense, and real estate and soft-

ware write-offs, partly offset by the continued impact of

expense management programs.
The 59% decrease in 
credit costs
reflected the improvement in
the quality of the credit portfolio and recoveries. 
Financial results overview
Investment Management & Private Banking (ÒIMPBÓ) operating
earnings are influenced by numerous factors, including equity,

fixed income and other asset valuations; investor flows and activ-
ity levels; investment performance; and expense and risk man-

agement. Global economic conditions rebounded in 2003, as

corporate earnings improved and the credit environment

strengthened. During 2003, global equity markets rose (as exem-

plified by the S&P 500 index, which rose by 26%, and the MSCI

World index, which rose by 31%), and investor activity levels
increased across IMPBÕs retail and private bank client bases, 
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
35Assets under supervision (ÒAUSÓ)at December 31, 2003,were $758 billion, an increase of 18% from the prior year-end.

Assets under management (ÒAUMÓ) increased by 9% to $559

billion, and custody, brokerage, administration and deposit

accounts increased by 54% to $199 billion. The increase in

AUM was driven by higher average equity market valuations in
client portfolios, partly offset by institutional net outflows.

Custody, brokerage, administration and deposits grew by $70

billion, driven by the acquisition of RPS ($41 billion), higher
average equity market valuations in client portfolios, and net
inflows from Private Bank clients. The diversification of AUS

across product classes, client segments and geographic regions

helped to mitigate the impact of market volatility on revenue.

The Firm also has a 44% interest in American Century

Companies, Inc., whose AUM totaled $87 billion and $72 billion
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts

are not included in the FirmÕs AUM total above.
Business outlookLooking forward to 2004, IMPB believes it is well positioned for

a continued global market recovery. Improved investment per-

formance and the continued execution of the Private Bank and
retail investment management strategies are expected to drive
operating earnings growth.

Financial results overview
JPMorgan Partners (ÒJPMPÓ) recognized 
negative operatingrevenueof $190 million and operating lossesof $293 millionin 2003. Opportunities to realize value through sales, recapital-

izations and initial public offerings (ÒIPOsÓ) of investments,

although limited, improved during the year as the M&A and 

IPO markets started to recover. 
Private equity gains totaled $27 million in 2003, compared with
a loss of $733 million in 2002. JPMP recognized gains of $346

million on direct investments and losses of $319 million on 

sales and writedowns of private third-party fund investments. 
Realized cash gains on direct investments of $535 million
increased 18% from the previous year. Realized cash gains were

recognized across all industries but were primarily realized 
from the Industrial and Consumer retail and services sectors. 

In addition, JPMP recorded unrealized gains of $215 million

Investment pace, portfolio diversification and capital under managementIn 2003, increased emphasis was placed on leveraged buyouts
and growth equity opportunities. JPMPÕs direct investments for 

the FirmÕs account in 2003 wer
e $773 million, a 19% decline from
the prior year. Approximately 67% of direct investments were in

theIndustrial, Consumer retail and services, Life sciences and
Healthcare infrastructure sectors.
JPMP reduced the size of the portfolio by 12%, largely the result
of sales of third-party fund investments, which declined by 

$744 million.At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of JPMPÕs public secu-
rities portfolio was $643 million, a 24% increase from 2002.

The increase resulted from higher market valuations and from

IPOs of certain portfolio investments, partially offset by ongoing

sales activity. 
Business outlookThe Firm continues to regard JPMP as a strategic business that 

will create value over the long term. JPMP is seeking to sell

selected investments that are not central to its portfolio strategy,

with the goal that, over time, JPMPÕs private equity portfolio will

represent a lower percentage of the FirmÕs common stockholdersÕ
equity. 
JPMPÕs private equity portfolio and financial performance are
sensitive to the level of M&A, IPO and debt financing activity.

Improved markets in 2004 could provide increased exit opportu-

nities and improved financial performance.

$2.5 billion, an increase of 8% from 2002. Return on allocated

capital was 28%, up from 27% in 2002. Shareholder value

added increased by 12%.
Operating revenue
was $14.6 billion in 2003, an increase of 9%
over 2002. Net interest income increased 17% to $9.6 billion,

reflecting the positive impact of the lower interest rate environ-
ment on consumer loan originations, particularly in Chase Home
Finance (ÒCHFÓ), and lower funding costs. The increase was partly

offset by reduced spreads on deposits. CHF revenue increased by

38% over the prior year, driven by strong operating revenue

(which excludes MSR hedging revenue) and, to a lesser extent,

higher MSR hedging revenue. Chase Cardmember Services

(ÒCCSÓ) revenue increased by 4%, the result of lower funding

costs, growth in average receivables and higher interchange fees

earned on customer purchases. Chase Auto Finance (ÒCAFÓ) 

revenue grew 23%, driven by record originations of almost 
$28 billion and lower funding costs. Chase Regional Banking
(ÒCRBÓ) and Chase Middle Market (ÒCMMÓ) revenues decreased

9% and 1%, respectively, as a result of lower deposit spreads from

lower interest rates, partly offset by the effect of significantly 

higher deposit volumes compared with 2002. 
Operating expenserose 10% to $7.3 billion. The increase in
expense reflects higher business volume and higher compensa-

tion costs. Partially offsetting higher expenses were savings

achieved through Six Sigma and other productivity efforts. The

overhead ratio increased slightly compared with a year ago.
Credit costs
on a managed basis (which includes securitizedcredit cards) of $3.4 billion increased by 9% compared with the

prior year. While credit quality remained stable in 2003, net

charge-offs increased by 2%. The increase in 2003 net charge-

offs was driven by a 19% increase in average managed loans.

CHF is the fourth largest mortgage originator and servicer in theUnited States, with more than four million customers. CHF con-

ducts business in all 50 states and has approximately 17,000

employees in more than 300 locations nationwide. CHF offers an

extensive array of residential mortgage products delivered across 

a variety of distribution channels and customer touch points. 
CHF comprises three key businesses: Production, Servicing and
Chase Home FinancePortfolio Lending. The Production business originates and sells

mortgages. The Servicing business manages accounts for CHFÕs

four million customers. The Portfolio Lending business holds for
investment adjustable-rate first mortgage loans, home equity
and manufactured housing loans originated and purchased

through the Production channels. These three segments provide

CHF with balance to enable it to benefit across varying business

cycles. The Production segment is most profitable when mort-

gage rates are declining and origination volume is high. Alterna-

tively, the Servicing business collects more fees when rates are

rising and mortgage prepayments are low. Portfolio Lending

provides increasing NII, with growth in home equity and

adjustable-rate first mortgage lending. The counter-cyclical

(Production/Servicing) and complementary (Portfolio Lending)

nature of these businesses, in combination with financial risk

management, enabled CHF to produce record earnings. 
The residential mortgage market had a record year in 2003,
with an estimated $3.8 trillion in industry-wide origination vol-
ume. The strong market was driven by historically low interest

rates, higher consumer confidence, improved housing afford-

ability and exceptionally strong new and existing home sales.

CHF capitalized on this environment, achieving record levels of
CFSÕs online offerings ended the year ranked No. 3 in credit
card and No. 6 in
banking by GŠmez Scorecards
ª, a servicewhich measures the quality of online financial services offerings.

CCS accounts sourced from the Internet channel reached 16%

of new account originations and represented 5% of the active

account base in 2003. In CRB, several enhancements to con-
sumer online offerings Ð including check imaging, statement

imaging and banking alerts Ð resulted in significant activation of

online capabilities by customers. CHF continued its emphasis on
providing online capabilities to its business-to-business partners

and increased its direct-to-consumer web usage by more than
100%. In CAF, online application processing reached 95% dealer
penetration, while consumer adoption of ChaseÕs online automo-

bile offerings continued to grow. 
Business outlookIn 2004, CFS anticipates operating revenue and earnings will be
lower, primarily due to a decrease in production revenue in CHF,

as refinancing activity declines from the record levels set in 2003.

While CFS expects the other retail businesses to report modest

revenue growth and improved efficiencies, this growth may not
offset the lower mortgage earnings. 
loan originations and applications. CHFÕs production market
share grew from 5.8% in 2002 to 7.6% in 2003, primarily 

due to successful expansion in first mortgage and home equity
lending through growth in strategic, higher-margin distribution

channels such as retail, wholesale, telephone-based and e-com-

merce. Origination volume totaled a record $284 billion, an

increase of 82% from 2002. Home Equity volume, a strategic

growth area, increased by 71% from the prior year. In addition,

despite record levels of loan prepayments in 2003, loans serv-

iced increased by 10% from year-end 2002 to $470 billion at

December 31, 2003. CHF manages and measures its results from two key perspec-
tives: its operating businesses (Production/Servicing and Portfolio

Lending) and revenue generated through managing the interest

rate risk associated with MSRs. The table below reconciles man-

agementÕs perspective on CHFÕs business results to the reported

GAAP line items shown on the Consolidated statement of
income and in the related Notes to consolidated financial state-

ments. While the operating and hedging activities are interrelated,

the MSR hedging function is a risk management activity subject
to significant volatility as market interest rates and yield curves

fluctuate. As a result, operating business results are reported 

separately from hedging results to gain a better perspective on

each activity.

cussion of MSRs, see Critical Accounting Estimates on page 77
and Note 16 on pages 107Ð109 of this Annual Report. 
Operating expense of $1.7 billion increased by 28% from 2002
as a result of growth in origination volume as well as a higher

level of mortgage servicing. Substantial portions of CHFÕs

expenses are variable in nature and, accordingly, fluctuate with

the overall level of origination and servicing activity. In addition

to increases brought on by higher business volumes, expenses

increased due to higher performance-related incentives, as well

as strategic investments made to further expand into higher-

margin business sectors, along with production-related restruc-

turing efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of 2003. These

increases were partially offset by continued gains in productivity

and benefits realized from Six Sigma initiatives during 2003. 
Credit costs of $240 million for 2003 increased by 26% from
2002 due to a higher provision for credit losses, primarily the

result of higher loan balances. Credit quality continued to be
strong relative to 2002, as evidenced by a lower net charge-off

ratio and 30+ day delinquency rate. Business-related metrics

CHF achieved record financial performance in 2003, as total 
revenue of $4.0 billion increased by 38% from 2002. Record
operating earnings of $1.3 billion increased by 48% from 2002. 
CHFÕs operating revenue (excluding MSR hedging revenue) of
$3.8 billion increased by 38% over 2002. The strong perform-

ance was due to record production revenue resulting from 

market-share growth, record margins and higher home equity

revenue. Management expects a decrease in revenue in 2004,
as production margins are expected to decline due to lower

origination volumes and increased price competition.
In its hedging activities, CHF uses a combination of derivativesand AFS securities to manage changes in the market value of
MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in the market value 

of MSRs with changes in the market value of the related risk

management instrument. During 2003, negative MSR valuation
adjustments of $785 million were more than offset by $1.0 bil-

lion of aggregate derivative gains, realized gains on sales of AFS

securities and net interest earned on AFS securities. Unrealized

CCSÕs operating results exclude the impact of credit card securitiza-
tions. CCS periodically securitizes a portion of its credit card port-

folio by transferring a pool of credit card receivables to a trust,

which sells securities to investors. CCS receives fee revenue for

continuing to service those receivables and additional revenue

from any interest and fees on the receivables in excess of the inter-

est paid to investors, net of credit losses and servicing fees. CCS

reports credit costs on a managed or operating basis. Credit costs

Operating earnings increased by 3% over 2002 to $679 million,
driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher credit costs

and expenses. The operating environment reflected continued

competitive pricing, a record level of bankruptcy filings and low

receivables growth. This was partly the result of mortgage refi-
nancing activity, which permitted consumers to use cash

received in their mortgage refinancings to pay down credit card
debt. CCS was able to grow earnings and originate a record

number of new accounts by offering rewards-based products,

improving operating efficiency, delivering high-level customer

service and improving retention and card usage. Management

believes that the shift towards r
ewards-based pr
oducts positionsCCS to capture consumer wallet shar
e in a highlycompetitive,
commoditized marketplace. In 2003, CCS launched several new
rewards products, including the ChasePerfect card, the
Marathon co-branded card and the GM Small Business card.
Operating revenue increased by 4% to $6.2 billion. Net interest
income increased by 2%, reflecting lower funding costs, partly

offset by a lower yield. The 4% growth in average receivables

was in line with industry trends. Noninterest revenue increased

by 6%, primarily reflecting higher interchange revenue, partially

offset by higher rebate costs. The increase in interchange rev-

enue reflects higher purchase volume due to new account

growth and the movement towards higher spending using

rewards-based products. During 2003, CCS originated 4.2 million
new accounts via multiple distribution channels. CCS continuesBusiness-related metrics

card loans. As the holder of the residual interest in the securitiza-

tion trust, CCS bears its share of the credit costs for securitized

loans. In JPMorgan ChaseÕs Consolidated financial statements,

credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reduce the

noninterest income remitted to the Firm from the securitization

trust. This income is reported in Credit card fees, in Fees and

CRB is the No. 1 bank in the New York tri-state area and a top
five bank in Texas (both ranked by retail deposits), providing

payment, liquidity, investment, insurance and credit products

and services to three primary customer segments: small busi-

ness, affluent and retail. Within these segments, CRB serves

326,000 small businesses, 433,000 affluent consumers and 

2.6 million mass-market consumers.CRBÕs continued focus on expanding customer relationships
resulted in a 14% increase in core deposits (for this purpose,
core deposits are total deposits less time deposits) from

December 31, 2002, and a 77% increase in the cross-sell of

Chase credit products over 2002. In 2003, mortgage and home

equity originations through CRBÕs distribution channels were

$3.4 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Branch-originated credit

cards totaled 77,000, contributing to 23% of CRB customers

holding Chase credit cards. CRB is compensated by CFSÕs credit

businesses for the home finance and credit card loans it origi-

nates and does not retain these balances.
Chase Regional Banking While CRB continues to position itself for growth, decreased

deposit spreads related to the low-rate environment and

increased credit costs resulted in an 80% decline in CRB 

operating earnings from 2002. This decrease was partly offset

by an 8% increase in total average deposits.
Operating revenue of $2.6 billion decreased by 9% compared
with 2002. Net interest income declined by 11% to $1.7 billion,

primarily attributable to the lower interest rate environment.

Noninterest revenue decreased 6% to $927 million due to lower

deposit service fees, decreased debit card fees and one-time

gains in 2002. CRBÕs revenue does not include funding profits

earned on its deposit base; these amounts are included in the

results of Global Treasury.
Operating expense of $2.4 billion increased by 7% from 2002. 
The increase was primarily due to investments in technology within

the branch network; also contributing were higher compensation

expenses related to increased staff levels and higher severance costs

as a result of continued restructuring. This increase in operating
CAF is the largest U.S. bank originator of automobile loans and
leases, with more than 2.9 million accounts. In 2003, CAF had a

record number of automobile loan and lease originations, growing
by 10% over 2002 to $27.8 billion. Loan and lease receivables of

$43.2 billion at December 31, 2003, were 16% higher than at the

prior year-end. Despite a challenging operating environment

reflecting slightly declining new car sales in 2003 and increased
competition, CAFÕs market share among automobile finance 

companies improved to 6.1% in 2003 from 5.7% in 2002. The

increase in market share was the result of strong organic growth

and an origination strategy that allies the business with manufac-
turers and dealers. CAFÕs relationships with several major car 

manufacturers contributed to 2003 growth, as did CAFÕs dealer

relationships, which increased from approximately 12,700 dealers
in 2002 to approximately 13,700 dealers in 2003. 
In 2003, operating earnings were $205 million, 23% higher 
compared with 2002. The increase in earnings was driven by 

continued revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. 

In 2003, CAFÕs operating revenue grew by 23% to $842 million.

Net interest income grew by 33% compared with 2002. The

increase was driven by strong operating performance due to 

higher average loans and leases outstanding, reflecting continued

strong origination volume and lower funding costs. 
Operating expense of $292 million increased by 18% compared
with 2002. The increase in expenses was driven by higher average
Chase Auto Financeloans outstanding, higher origination volume and higher perform-
ance-based incentives. CAFÕs overhead ratio improved from 36% 

in 2002 to 35% in 2003, as a result of strong revenue growth, con-

tinued productivity gains and disciplined expense management.
Credit costs increased 18% to $205 million, primarily reflecting a
32% increase in average loan and lease receivables. Credit quality

continued to be strong relative to 2002, as evidenced by a lower

net charge-off ratio and 30+ day delinquency rate.
CAF also comprises Chase Education Finance, a top provider of
government-guaranteed and private loans for higher education.

Loans are provided through a joint venture with Sallie Mae, a 

government-sponsored enterprise and the leader in funding and

servicing education loans. Chase Education FinanceÕs origination

volume totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 4% from last year.

The Support Units and Corporate sector includes technology,
legal, audit, finance, human resources, risk management, real

estate management, procurement, executive management and

marketing groups within Corporate. The technology and pro-

curement services organizations seek to provide services to the

FirmÕs businesses that are competitive with comparable third-

party providers in terms of price and service quality. These units

use the FirmÕs global scale and technology to gain efficiencies

through consolidation, standardization, vendor management

and outsourcing.
Support Units and Corporate reflects the application of the
FirmÕs management accounting policies at the corporate level.

These policies allocate the costs associated with technology,

operational and staff support services to the business seg-

ments, with the intent to recover all expenditures associated

with these services. Other items are retained within Support

Units and Corporate based on policy decisions, such as the
over/under allocation of economic capital, the residual compo-

nent of credit costs and taxes. Business segment revenues are

reported on a tax-equivalent basis, with the offset reflected in
Support Units and Corporate.During 2003, the Firm reviewed its management accounting
policies, which resulted in the realignment of certain revenues

and expenses from the Corporate segment to other business

segments. The policy refinements ranged from updating

expense-allocation methodologies to revising transfer pricing

policies to more clearly reflect the actual interest income and

expense of the Firm. The impact of these changes was allocated
among the business segments; prior periods have been revised

to reflect the current methodologies. 
For 2003, Support Units and Corporate had operating earnings of
$44 million, compared with an operating loss of $313 million in

2002, driven primarily by income tax benefits not allocated to the
business segments. In allocating the allowance (and provision) for credit losses, each
business is responsible for its credit costs. Although the Support

Units and Corporate sector has no traditional credit assets, the

residual component of the allowance, which is available for lossesin any business segment, is maintained at the corporate level. For
a further discussion of the residual component, see Allowance for

credit losses on pages 64Ð65 of this Annual Report. 
Average allocated capital was $2.9 billion higher than 2002,
reflecting a reduction in risks and economic capital allocated to
the business segments. In December 2002, JPMorgan Chase entered into a seven-year
agreement with IBM to outsource portions of the FirmÕs internal

technology infrastructure services. Commencing April 1, 2003,

2,800 employees were transferred to IBM in connection with this

agreement. The agreement is expected to transform the FirmÕs

technology infrastructure through increased cost variability,

access to the best research and innovation, and improved service

levels. By moving from a traditional fixed-cost approach to one

with increased capacity and cost variability, the Firm expects to

be able to respond more quickly to changing market conditions. 
ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
44J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, focuses on credit risk, market
risk, operational risk, business risk, private equity risk and fiduci-
ary risk. Both risk committees have decision-making authority,

with major policy decisions and risk exposures subject to review

by the Office of the Chairman.
In addition to the Risk Policy Committee, the Audit Committeeof the Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of guide-

lines and policies to govern the process by which risk assess-

ment and management is undertaken. In addition, the Audit
Committee reviews with management the system of internal

controls and financial reporting that is relied upon to provide

reasonable assurance of compliance with the FirmÕs operational
risk management processes. 
The FirmÕs use of SVA, which incorporates a risk-adjusted capital
methodology as its primary performance measure, has strength-

ened its risk management discipline by charging the businesses
the cost of capital linked to the risks associated with their
respective activities.For a discussion of capital allocation methodologies, see therespective risk management sections on pages 46Ð74 of thisAnnual Report.Risk management at JPMorgan Chase is guided by several principles, including:¥ defined risk governance
¥ independent oversight

¥ continual evaluation of risk appetite, managed through risk
limits¥ portfolio diversification
¥ risk assessment and measurement, including Value-at-Risk
analysis and portfolio stress testing
¥ performance measurement (SVA) that allocates risk-adjusted 
capital to business units and charges a cost against that capital. Risk management and oversight begins with the Risk PolicyCommittee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the gover-

nance of these activities, delegating the formulation of policy
and day-to-day risk oversight and management to the Office of

the Chairman and to two corporate risk committees: the Capital

Capital also is assessed against business units for certain nonriskfactors. Businesses are assessed capital equal to 100% of any

goodwill and 50% for certain other intangibles generated through

acquisitions. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase assesses an Òasset

capital taxÓ against managed assets and some offÐbalance sheet

instruments. These assessments recognize that certain minimum

regulatory capital ratios must be maintained by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase also estimates the portfolio effect on required

economic capital based on correlations of risk across risk cate-

gories. This estimated diversification benefit leads to a reduction

in required economic capital for the Firm. 
The total required economic capital for JPMorgan Chase as deter-
mined by its models and after considering the FirmÕs estimated

diversification benefits is then compared with available common

stockholdersÕ equity to evaluate overall capital utilization. The
FirmÕs policy is to maintain an appropriate level of excess capital to

provide for growth and additional protection against losses.
The FirmÕs capital in excess of that which is internally required as of
December 31, 2003, increased by $2.7 billion over December 31,

2002. The change was primarily due to an increase in average

common stockholdersÕ equity of $1.6 billion and to a $1.3 bil-
lion reduction in average capital allocated to business activities,

principally in relation to credit risk and private equity risk. Credit

risk capital decreased by $0.9 billion from the prior year, primarily

due to a reduction in commercial exposures, improvement in 

the credit quality of the commer
cial portfolio and an increase 
in hedging of commercial exposures using single-name credit

derivatives. Private equity risk decreased 
primarilyas a 
result ofthe reduction in JPMPÕs private equity portfolio.  
Regulatory capital:JPMorgan ChaseÕs primary federal banking
regulator, the Federal Reserve Board, establishes capital require-
ments, including well-capitalized standards and leverage ratios,

for the consolidated financial holding company and its state-
chartered banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Office of

the Comptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital

requirements and standards for the FirmÕs national bank sub-
sidiaries, including Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A. As of
December 31, 2003, the financial holding company and its
banking subsidiaries maintained capital levels well in excess of
the minimum capital requirements.
At December 31, 2003, the Tier 1 and Total capital ratios were
8.5% and 11.8%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was

5.6%. The Capital Committee reviews the FirmÕs capital levels

and policies regularly in light of changing economic conditions

and business needs. At December 31, 2003, Total capital of

JPMorgan Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) was

$59.8 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from December 31,

2002. This increase reflected a $5.6 billion increase in Tier 1

capital, primarily driven by a $3.8 billion increase in retained

earnings (net income less common and preferred dividends)

generated during the period, $1.1 billion in Tier 1 trust preferred

net issuance and $1.3 billion in net stock issuances relatedto

employee stock-based benefit plans. This increase was partially

offset by a higher deduction for goodwill and nonqualifying
Capital and Liquidity managementCapital management   
JPMorgan ChaseÕs capital management framework helps to

optimize the use of capital by:¥ Determining the amount of capital commensurate with:
- internal assessments of risk as estimated by the FirmÕs 
economic capital allocation model- the FirmÕs goal to limit losses, even under stress conditions

- targeted regulatory ratios and credit ratings

- the FirmÕs liquidity management strategy.
¥ Directing capital investment to activities with the most 
favorable risk-adjusted returns.
Economic risk capital:JPMorgan Chase assesses capital ade-quacy utilizing internal risk assessment methodologies. The Firm

assigns economic capital based primarily on five risk factors:
credit risk, market risk, operational risk and business risk for

each business, and private equity risk, principally for JPMP. The

methodologies quantify these risks and assign capital accordingly.

These methodologies are discussed in the risk management 

sections of this Annual Report. A review of the FirmÕs risk and capital measurement methodolo-
gies was completed in 2003, resulting in the reallocation of 

capital among the risk categories and certain business segments.
The new capital measurement methodologies did not result in a

significant change in the total capital allocated to the business
segments as a whole. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect

the revised capital measurement methodologies. For a further 

discussion of these new methodologies, see Capital allocation for
credit risk, operational risk and business risk, and private equity

risk on pages 52, 73 and 74, respectively, of this Annual Report.

Internal capital allocation methodologies may change in the

future to reflect refinements of economic capital methodologies.

47Liquidity management  In managing liquidity, management considers 
a variety of liquidity risk measures as well as

market conditions, prevailing interest rates, 

liquidity needs and the desired maturity profile

of its liabilities.
OverviewLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the FirmÕs
activities and in the management of its assets and liabilities.
JPMorgan Chase recognizes the importance of sound liquidity

management as a key factor in maintaining strong credit ratings

and utilizes a liquidity framework intended to maximize liquidity
access and minimize funding costs. Through active liquidity

management, the Firm seeks to ensure that it will be able to

replace maturing obligations when due and fund its assets atappropriate maturities and rates in all market environments.
Liquidity management framework The Capital Committee sets the overall liquidity policy for the
Firm, reviews the contingency funding plan and recommends bal-

ance sheet targets for the Firm. The Liquidity Risk Committee,
reporting to the Capital Committee, identifies and monitors liq-uidity issues, pro
vides policy guidance and maintains an evolvingcontingency plan.The Balance Sheet Committee, which alsoreports to the Capital Committee, identifies and monitors keybalance sheet issues, provides policy guidance and oversees

adherence to policy.
JPMorgan Chase utilizes liquidity monitoring tools to help main-tain appropriate levels of liquidity through normal and stress

periods. The FirmÕs liquidity analytics rely on managementÕs judg-

ment about JPMorgan ChaseÕs ability to liquidate assets or use

them as collateral for borrowings. These analytics also involve

estimates and assumptions, taking into account credit risk man-

agementÕs historical data on the funding of loan commitments

(e.g., commercial paper back-up facilities), liquidity commitments

to SPEs, commitments with rating triggers and collateral posting
requirements. For further discussion of SPEs and other offÐbal-
ance sheet arrangements, see OffÐbalance sheet arrangements

and contractual cash obligations on pages 49Ð50as 
well as Note 1, Note 13 and Note 14 on pages 86Ð87, 100Ð103 and
103Ð106, respectively, of this Annual Report.
The FirmÕs three primary measures of liquidity are: 

¥ Holding company short-term surplus: Measures the parent
holding companyÕs ability to repay all obligations with a matu-

rity under one year at a time when the ability of the FirmÕs

banks to pay dividends to the parent holding company is con-

strained.¥ Cash capital surplus: Measures the FirmÕs ability to fund assets
on a fully collateralized basis, assuming access to unsecured

funding is lost.¥ Basic surplus: Measures JPMorgan Chase BankÕs ability to sustain
a 90-day stress event that is specific to the Firm where no new

funding can be raised to meet obligations as they come due.Each of the FirmÕs liquidity surplus positions, as of December 31,
2003, indicates that JPMorgan ChaseÕs long-dated funding, includ-

ing core deposits, exceeds illiquid assets and that the FirmÕs obliga-

tions can be met if access to funding is temporarily impaired.
An extension of the FirmÕs ongoing liquidity management is its
contingency funding plan, which is intended to help the Firm
manage through liquidity stress periods. The plan considers tem-

porary and long-term stress scenarios and forecasts potential

funding needs when access to unsecured funding is severely lim-

ited or nonexistent. These scenarios take into account both onÐ
and offÐbalance sheet exposures, evaluating access to funds by

the parent holding company, JPMorgan Chase Bank and Chase

Manhattan Bank USA, N.A., separately.
Funding Credit ratings:
The cost and availability of unsecured financing
are influenced by credit ratings. A reduction in these ratings could

adversely affect the FirmÕs access to liquidity sources, and could

increase the cost of funding or trigger additional collateral require-

ments. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include: a

stable and diverse earnings stream; strong capital ratios; strong

credit quality and risk management controls; diverse funding

sources; and strong liquidity monitoring procedures.
intangible assets primarily due to an acquisition in the fourthquarter of 2003. There was minimal impact to the FirmÕs Tier 1

and Total capital ratios due to the adoption of FIN 46, as the

Federal Reserve Board provided interim regulatory capital relief

related to asset-backed commercial paper conduits and trust
preferred vehicles. The effect of FIN 46 on the FirmÕs leverage

ratio at December 31, 2003, was a reduction of approximately

Upon the announcement of the proposed merger with Bank One,
MoodyÕs and Fitch placed the ratings of the Firm under review for

Balance sheet:The FirmÕs 
total assets increased to $771 billion at
December 31, 2003, from $759 billion at December 31, 2002. The

December 31, 2003, balance sheet includes the effect of adopting

FIN 46, which added $10 billion to total assets, including $5.8 billion

in commercial loans primarily associated with multi-seller asset-

backed commercial paper conduits. Commercial loans declined

$14.2 billion, excluding the impact of adopting FIN 46, as a result

of weaker loan demand, as well as the FirmÕs ongoing efforts to

reduce commercial exposure. Consumer loans increased $11.6 bil-
lion, led by strong growth in mortgage and automobile loans, 

driven by the favorable rate environment throughout 2003. Credit

card loans declined modestly, affected by increased securitization

activity and higher levels of payments from cash redeployed from

consumer mortgage refinancings. The securities portfolio declined

due to changes in positioning related to structural interest rate risk

management. The continued growth in deposits contributed to the

decline in securities sold under repurchase agreements.
Sources of funds:
The diversity of the FirmÕs funding sources
enhances financial flexibility and limits dependence on any one
source, thereby minimizing the cost of funds. JPMorgan Chase has

access to funding markets across the globe and across a broad

investor base. Liquidity is generated using a variety of both short-
term and long-term instruments, including deposits, federal funds

purchased, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, bank notes,

medium- and long-term debt, capital securities and stockholdersÕ
equity. A major source of liquidity for JPMorgan Chase Bank is pro-

vided by its large core deposit base. For this purpose, core deposits

include all U.S. domestic deposits insured by the FDIC, up to the

legal limit of $100,000 per depositor. In addition to core deposits,

the Firm benefits from substantial, stable deposit balances 

originated by TSS through the normal course of its business.
Additional funding flexibility is provided by the FirmÕs ability to
access the repurchase and asset securitization markets. These

alternatives are evaluated on an ongoing basis to achieve the

appropriate balance of secured and unsecured funding. The ability

to securitize loans, and the associated gains on those securitiza-
tions, are principally dependent on the credit quality and yields

of the assets securitized and are generally not dependent on the
credit ratings of the issuing entity. Transactions between the
Firm and its securitization structures are reflected in JPMorgan

ChaseÕs financial statements; these relationships include retained

interests in securitization trusts, liquidity facilities and derivative

transactions. For further details, see Notes 13 and 14 on pages
100Ð103 and 103Ð106, respectively, of this Annual Report.
Issuance:Corporate credit spreads narrowed in 2003 across
industries and sectors, reflecting the market perception that

credit risks were improving sharply throughout the year, as the

number of downgrades declined, corporate balance sheet cash
positions increased, and corporate profits exceeded expecta-

tions. JPMorgan ChaseÕs credit spreads outperformed relative to

peer spreads following the Enron settlement, reflecting reduced

headline risk and improved earnings performance. This resulted

in a positive overall shift in fixed income investor sentiment
toward JPMorgan Chase, as evidenced by increased investor

participation in debt transactions and extension of debt 
maturities. The Firm took advantage of its narrowing credit

spreads by issuing long-term debt and capital securities 

opportunistically throughout the year. 
During 2003, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $17.2 billion
of long-term debt and capital securities. During the year, $8.3 bil-

lion of long-term debt and capital securities matured or was

redeemed. In addition, in 2003 the Firm securitized approximately
$13.3 billion of residential mortgage loans, $8.8 billion of credit

card loans and $4.5 billion of automobile loans, resulting in pre-

tax gains on securitizations of $168 million, $44 million and 
$13 million, respectively. For a further discussion of loan securiti-

zations, see Note 13 on pages 100Ð103 of this Annual Report.  During 2003, the Firm adopted FIN 46 and, as a result, deconsol-
idated the trusts that issue trust preferred securities. This could

have significant implications for the FirmÕs capital, because it may

change the way the Federal Reserve Board views the Tier 1 status

of trust preferred securities. On July 2, 2003, the Federal Reserve

Board issued a supervisory letter instructing banks and bank

holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securi-

ties in Tier 1 capital. Based on the terms of this letter and in con-

sultation with the Federal Reserve Board, the Firm continues to

include its trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. However,

there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve Board will

continue to permit trust preferred securities to count as Tier 1

capital in the future. For a further discussion, see Note 18 on

pages 110Ð111 of this Annual Report.
Derivatives are used in liquidity risk management and funding
to achieve the FirmÕs desired interest rate risk profile. The Firm
enters into derivatives contracts to swap fixed-rate debt to 
floating-rate obligations and to swap floating-rate debt to fixed-
rate obligations. Derivatives contracts are also used to hedge the

variability in interest rates that arises from other floating-rate

financial instruments and forecasted transactions, such as the

rollover of short-term assets and liabilities.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
49OffÐbalance sheet arrangements and
contractual cash obligationsSpecial-purpose entitiesSpecial-purpose entities (ÒSPEsÓ), special-purpose vehicles(ÒSPVsÓ), or variable-interest entities (ÒVIEsÓ), are an important

part of the financial markets, providing market liquidity by facili-

tating investorsÕ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks.
SPEs are not operating entities; typically they are established for

a single, discrete purpose, have a limited life and have no

employees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling

assets to the SPE. The SPE funds the asset purchase by selling

securities to investors. To insulate investors from creditors of

other entities, including the seller of the assets, SPEs are often

structured to be bankruptcy-remote. SPEs are critical to the

functioning of many investor markets, including, for example,
the market for mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed
securities and commercial paper. JPMorgan Chase is involved

with SPEs in three broad categories of transactions: loan securi-

tizations (through ÒqualifyingÓ SPEs), multi-seller conduits, and

client intermediation. Capital is held, as appropriate, against all

SPE-related transactions and related exposures such as deriva-

tive transactions and lending-related commitments. 
The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to supportany SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions

with SPEs be conducted at armÕs length and reflect market pric-

ing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is

permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved
where such investment would violate the FirmÕs Worldwide

Rules of Conduct. These rules prohibit employees from self-

dealing and prohibit employees from acting on behalf of the

Firm in transactions with which they or their family have any
significant financial interest. 
For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could berequired to provide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan
Chase Bank were downgraded below specific levels, primarily 

P-1, A-1 and F1 for MoodyÕs, Standard & PoorÕs and Fitch,

respectively. The amount of these liquidity commitments was
$34.0 billion at December 31, 2003. If JPMorgan Chase Bank
were required to provide funding under these commitments, the

Firm could be replaced as liquidity provider. Additionally, with

respect to the multi-seller conduits and structured commercial
loan vehicles for which JPMorgan Chase Bank has extended liq-
uidity commitments, the Bank could facilitate the sale or refi-

nancing of the assets in the SPE in order to provide liquidity.  
Of these liquidity commitments to SPEs, $27.7 billion is includedin the FirmÕs total Other unfunded commitments to extend

credit included in the table on the following page. As a result 

of the consolidation of multi-seller conduits in accordance with

FIN 46, $6.3 billion of these commitments are excluded from

the table, as the underlying assets of the SPE have been included

on the FirmÕs Consolidated balance sheet.

Contractual cash obligationsIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various con-
tractual obligations that may require future cash payments.

Contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, include Long-term
debt, trust preferred capital securities, operating leases, contractual

purchases and capital expenditures and certain Other liabilities. For

a further discussion regarding Long-term debt and trust preferred

capital securities, see Note 18 on pages 109Ð111 of this Annual

ments for future cash expenditures, primarily for services and

contracts involving certain forward purchases of securities and

commodities. Capital expenditures primarily represent future

cash payments for real estateÐrelated obligations and equip-

ment. Contractual purchases and capital expenditures at

December 31, 2003, reflect the minimum contractual obligation

under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are

both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the following table
are a number of obligations to be settled in cash, primarily in

under one year. These obligations are reflected on the FirmÕs

Consolidated balance sheet and include Deposits; Federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements; Other

borrowed funds; purchases of Debt and equity instruments that

settle within standard market timeframes (e.g. regular-way);

Derivative payables that do not require physical delivery of the

underlying instrument; and certain purchases of instruments that

resulted in settlement failures.

51Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty
default. The Firm is exposed to credit risk through its lending

(e.g., loans and lending-related commitments), trading and capi-

tal markets activities. Credit risk management practices are

designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the risk-

assessment process. Processes in place are intended to ensure

that credit risks are adequately assessed, properly approved,

continually monitored and actively managed. Risk is managed at

both the individual transaction and portfolio levels. The Firmassesses and manages all credit exposures, whether they arise
from transactions recorded on- or offÐbalance sheet.
Credit risk organization
In early 2003, the Credit Risk Policy and Global Credit

Management functions were combined to form Global Credit

The FirmÕs business strategy for its large corporate commercial
portfolio remains primarily one of origination for distribution.

The majority of the FirmÕs wholesale loan originations in IB con-

tinue to be distributed into the marketplace, with residual holds

by the Firm averaging less than 10%. The commercial loan port-
folio declined by 9% in 2003, reflecting a combination of con-
tinued weak loan demand, the FirmÕs ongoing goal of reducing

commercial credit concentrations and refinancings into more liq-

uid capital markets. The FirmÕs SVA discipline discourages the

retention of loan assets that do not generate a positive return
above the cost of risk-adjusted capital. SVA remains a critical

discipline in making loans and commitments, particularly when
combined with other credit and capital management disciplines.
ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
52J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
To measure commercial credit risk, the Firm estimates the likelihood
of obligor or counterparty default; the amount of exposure should

the obligor or the counterparty default; and the loss severity given a
default event. Based on these factors and related market-based

inputs, the Firm estimates both expected and unexpected losses for
each segment of the portfolio. Expected losses are statistically-based

estimates of credit losses over time, anticipated as a result of obligor

or counterparty default. They are used to set risk-adjusted credit loss

provisions. However, expected credit losses are not the sole indica-

tors of risk. If losses were entirely predictable, the expected loss rate

could be factored into pricing and covered as a normal and recurring

cost of doing business. Unexpected losses represent the potential

volatility of actual losses relative to the expected level of losses and

are the basis for the FirmÕs credit risk capital-allocation process.
In 2003, the Firm significantly modified its approach to commer-
cial credit risk management to further enhance risk management

discipline, improve returns and liquidity and use capital more effi-

ciently. Three primary initiatives were launched during the year:

improved single-name and industry concentration management,

through a revised threshold and limit structure; a revised capital

methodology; and increased portfolio management activity utiliz-

ing credit derivatives and loan sales. The Firm manages capital

and exposure concentrations by obligor, risk rating, industry and

geography. The Firm has reduced by one-half the number of

clients whose credit exposure exceeded the narrowest definition

of concentration limits during 2003, through focused client plan-

ning and portfolio management activities.A comprehensive review of the FirmÕs wholesale credit risk 
management infrastructure was completed in 2003. As a result,

the Firm has commenced a multi-year initiative to reengineer

specific components of the credit risk infrastructure, including

creation of a simpler infrastructure with more standardized

hardware and software platforms. The goal of the initiative is 

to enhance the FirmÕs ability to provide immediate and accurate

risk and exposure information; actively manage credit risk in the

residual portfolio; support client relationships; manage more
quickly the allocation of economic capital; and support compli-
ance with Basel II initiatives.ConsumerConsumer credit risks are monitored at the aggregate CFS level

and within each line of business (mortgages, credit cards, auto-

mobile finance, small business and consumer banking).
Consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio

modeling, credit scoring and decision-support tools to project 

credit risks and establish underwriting standards. Risk parameters

are established in the early stages of product development, and

the cost of credit risk is an integral part of product pricing and

evaluating profit dynamics. Losses generated by consumer loans

are more predictable than for commercial loans, but are subject to

cyclical and seasonal factors. The frequency of loss is higher on

consumer loans than on corporate loans but the severity of losses is

typically lower and more manageable, depending on whether loans

are secured or not. In addition, common measures of credit quality

derived from historical loss experience can be used to predict 
consumer losses. Likewise, underwriting principles and philoso-phies are common among lenders focusing on borrowers of 

similar credit quality. For these reasons, Consumer Credit Risk

Management focuses on trends and concentrations at the portfo-

lio level, where problems can be remedied through changes in

underwriting policies and adherence to portfolio guidelines.

Consumer Credit Risk Management also monitors key risk attrib-

utes, including borrower credit quality, loan performance (as meas-

ured by delinquency) and losses (expected versus actual). The

monthly and quarterly analysis of trends around these attributes is

monitored against business expectations and industry benchmarks.
Capital allocation for credit risk Unexpected credit losses drive the allocation of credit risk capital

by portfolio segment. In the commercial portfolio, capital allocations are differentiated
by risk rating, loss severity, maturity, correlations and assumed

exposure at default. In 2003, the Firm revised its methodology for

the assessment of credit risk capital allocated to the commercial

credit portfolio, more closely aligning capital with current market

conditions. Specifically, the new approach employs estimates of

default likelihood that are derived from current market parame-

ters and is intended to capture the impact of both defaults and

declines in market value due to credit deterioration. This approach

is intended to reflect more accurately current risk conditions, as

well as to enhance the management of commercial credit risk by

encouraging the utilization of the growing market in credit deriva-

tives and secondary market loan sales. See the Capital manage-
ment section on pages 46Ð47 of this Annual Report.Within the consumer businesses, capital allocations are differen-
tiated by product and product segment. For the consumer port-

folio, consumer products are placed into categories with

homogenous credit characteristics, from which default rates and

charge-offs can be estimated. Credit risk capital is allocated

based on the unexpected loss inherent in those categories.
Commercial and consumer credit portfolio 
JPMorgan ChaseÕs total credit exposure (which includes $34.9

billion of securitized credit cards) was $730.9 billion at

December 31, 2003, a 2% increase from year-end 2002. The

increase reflected a change in the portfolioÕs composition: a

$41.5 billion increase in consumer exposure, partially offset by 

a $30.2 billion decrease in commercial exposure.
Managed consumer loans increased by $15.7 billion, primarily
resulting from higher levels of residential mortgage and automo-
bile originations, while lending-related commitments increased

by $25.8 billion, primarily in the home finance and credit card

businesses.Commercial exposure decreased by 7% to $382.7 billion as of
year-end 2003, the result of an $8.5 billion decrease in loans and

a $22.4 billion decrease in lending-related commitments. The

decrease in loans outstanding reflected weaker demand, as well

as the FirmÕs ongoing credit management activities, including 

$5.2 billion in loan and commitment sales. This was partially offset
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
53For commercial lending-related commitments, the Firm measures
its Economic credit exposure using a Òloan equivalentÓ amount

for each commitment, rather than the contractual amount of the
lending-related commitment. The contractual amount represents

the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw

down the commitment and subsequently default. However, most

of these commitments expire without a default occurring or with-

out being drawn. As a result, the total contractual amount of

these instruments is not, in the FirmÕs view, representative of the

FirmÕs actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. In

determining the FirmÕs Economic credit exposure to commercial

lending-related commitments, the Firm has established a Òloan-

equivalentÓ amount for each commitment. The loan-equivalent
amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or

other contingent exposure that is likely, based on average portfolio

historical experience, to become outstanding in the event of a
default by the obligor. It is this amount that, in managementÕs

view, represents the FirmÕs Economic credit exposure to the 

obligor. The aggregate amount of its Economic credit exposure

associated with commercial lending-related commitments was

$106.9 billion in 2003, compared with $115.5 billion in 2002. 
The following table reconciles commercial lendingÐrelated 
commitments on a GAAP basis with the FirmÕs Economic credit

exposure basis, a non-GAAP financial measure.

was due to an overall contraction in lending demand and
reflected a $6.3 billion decline due to the adoption of FIN 46.For further discussion of FIN 46, see Note 14 on pages 103Ð106of this Annual Report.The Firm also views its credit exposure on an ÒEconomicÓ basis,
which is the basis upon which it allocates credit capital to the

lines of business. The principal difference between the FirmÕs

credit exposure on a reported basis and Economic credit expo-

sure relates to the way the Firm views its credit exposure to

derivative receivables and lending-related commitments. 
For derivative receivables, the Firm measures its Economic credit
exposure using the Average exposure (ÒAVGÓ) metric. This is a

measure of the expected MTM value of the FirmÕs derivative

receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of col-
lateral. The three-year average of the AVG metric is the FirmÕs

Economic measure of derivative risk since three years is the

average remaining life of the derivatives portfolio; it was 

$34 billion as of December 31, 2003. For more information,

see the Derivative contracts section of this Annual Report.The following table reconciles Derivative receivables on a MTM

compared with 2003 credit exposure of $730.9 billion. 
The following table presents JPMorgan ChaseÕs credit portfolio as of December 31, 2003 and 2002:
The FirmÕs allocated credit capital (including the benefit from 
credit derivative hedges) decreased significantly during 2003, to

$10.3 billion at December 31, 2003, from $15.4 billion at year-

end 2002. The $5.1 billion decrease was related to lower expo-

sure in the commercial portfolio, hedging and loan sale activities,

and significantly improved credit quality in the loan portfolio.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
55Commercial exposure Ð selected industry concentrations
During 2003, the Firm undertook a thorough analysis of industry
risk correlations. As a result, the Firm developed a new industry

structure, intended to provide stronger linkages between expo-

sures with common risk attributes. The Firm expects these

changes to enhance its ability to manage industry risks consis-
tently across regions and lines of business. The implementation
of the new industry structure resulted in shifts in credit exposure,
with increases in some industries due to consolidation and

decreases in others as a result of realignments. In managing

industry risk, the Firm recognizes customers that have multiple

industry affiliations in each industry category. However, the 

following table ranks exposures only by a customerÕs primary

industry affiliation to prevent double counting.

Commercial credit portfolio
The following table summarizes the maturity and ratings profiles
of the commercial portfolio as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The ratings scale is based on the FirmÕs internal risk ratings, and

is presented on an S&PÐequivalent basis.
At December 31, 2003, 83% of the total commercial credit
exposure of $383 billion was considered investment-grade, an

improvement from 80% at year-end 2002. There was improve-

ment across all components of credit exposure, most 
significantlyin loans, as commercial criticized exposure declined by 47%,
while the total commercial loan balance declined by 9%. 
Under the FirmÕs Economic view of credit exposure, the portion
of the portfolio that was deemed investment-grade improved to

80% as of December 31, 2003, from 74% at year-end 2002. In

addition to the improved credit quality of loans and lending-

related commitments, the investment-grade component ofDerivative receivables improved to 91% at year-end 2003 from

85% at the end of 2002.ManagementÕs discussion and analysis

Selected industry discussion Presented below is a discussion of several industries to which
the Firm has significant exposure and which it continues to

monitor because of actual or potential credit concerns.
¥ Commercial banks: 
The industry represents the largest seg-
ment of the FirmÕs commercial credit exposure, and 96% of

the credit exposure is rated investment-grade. Collateral held

against $33.3 billion in derivative receivables is valued at

$24.7 billion. The industry distribution of the FirmÕs commercial credit exposure (loans, derivative receivables and lending-related commitmen
ts) underthe new industry structure, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, was as follows:
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
57¥ Utilities:The Firm significantly reduced its credit exposure to
this segment over the last twelve months, from $17.7 billion

to $15.3 billion, a 14% decline. This reduction was achieved

by significant refinancing activity in nonbank capital markets,

restructurings in the industry and a decline in client demand
for lending activity. Criticized credit exposures, primarily related

to U.S. customers, were reduced by 65%, to $998 million.

Utilities became a top-10 industry as a result of the new

industry structure, which consolidated several related sectors.
¥ Media:Total credit exposure declined by 20% to $14.1 billion.
The quality of the portfolio was enhanced by a reduction in criti-

cized exposures, primarily in the European cable sector, which

increased the proportion of investment-grade exposures from

58% to 65% of the portfolio. Overall, criticized exposures were

reduced by 36%, to $1.7 billion. Media became a top-10 industry
as a result of 
the new industry str
ucture, which consolidated 
several related sectors.
¥ Telecom services:
In 2003, the telecommunications industryworldwide improved its financial picture significantly after

severe capital and liquidity constraints in 2002. Overall, credit

exposures declined by 30% to $10.9 billion during the year;

75% of the credit exposure is considered investment-grade

compared with 59% in 2002. Criticized exposures were

reduced by 59% during the year, the result of capital markets
refinancings, other restructurings and acquisitions of weaker
market participants by stronger companies. 
¥ Automotive:In 2003, automotive companies accessed non-bank capital markets, reducing the FirmÕs credit exposure by
$924 million. While total credit exposure to this industry is 

significant, more than half of the exposure is undrawn. At

December 31, 2003, 76% of 
this portfolio was rated invest-ment-grade, an increase from 2002.
¥ All other:
All other at December 31, 2003 included $180 billion of credit exposure to 21 industry segments.

Exposures related to special-purpose entities and high net

worth individuals totaled 38% of this category. Special-

purpose entities provide secured financing (generally backed 

by receivables, loans or bonds) originated by companies in a

diverse group of industries which are not highly correlated. 

The remaining All other exposure is well diversified across

other industries, none of which comprise more than 3% of

total exposure.   
Commercial criticized exposureExposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile

similar to a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and lower, as defined by

Standard & PoorÕs/MoodyÕs. As of year-end 2003, the total 

$8.9 billion in criticized exposure represented 2% of total com-

mercial credit exposure and was down $7.7 billion, or 47%,

from December 31, 2002. The significant decrease was due 

to improved economic conditions, restructurings and capital

markets refinancings during the year, in particular in the

Telecom services, Media and Utilities industries.Criticized exposure - industry concentrations

No industry

below the top five is larger than 5% of the total. 
Enron-related exposure The FirmÕs exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities 

was reduced by 11% during the year, from $688 million at

December 31, 2002, to $609 million at December 31, 2003. The
reduction was primarily due to the maturation of $50 million ofdebtor-in-possession financing and repayments on secured expo-

sures. At December 31, 2003, secured exposure of $270 million

isperforming and is reported on an amortized cost basis.
ManagementÕs discussion and analysis

58J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Country exposure addition, the benefit of collateral, credit derivative hedges and
other short credit or equity trading positions are reflected. Total

exposure includes exposure to both government and private-

sector entities in a country.
The slight decrease in exposure to Brazil over the prior year-end
was due to reductions in loans. The decline in Mexican exposure

when compared with the prior year was primarily due to loan

maturities and reductions in counterparty exposure on deriva-

tives. The reduction in South Korea was due to a combination 

of loan maturities and trading activities. Hong KongÕs exposure

declined due to lower counterparty exposure on derivatives. The

increase in Russian exposure was due to cross-border and local

trading positions and short-term lending.  The Firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and manag-
ing its country exposures and risk. Exposures to a country include

all credit-related lending, trading and investment activities,

whether cross-border or locally funded. In addition to monitoring

country exposures, the Firm uses stress tests to measure and man-

age the risk of extreme loss associated with sovereign crises.
The table below presents the FirmÕs exposure to selected coun-
tries. The selection of countries is based on the materiality of
the FirmÕs exposure and its view of actual or potentially adverse

credit conditions. Exposure amounts are adjusted for credit

enhancements (e.g., guarantees and letters of credit) provided

by third parties located outside the country if the enhancements

fully cover the country risk, as well as the commercial risk. In
Derivative contracts In the normal course of business, the Firm utilizes derivative
instruments to meet the needs of customers, to generate rev-

enues through trading activities, to manage exposure to fluctu-

ations in interest rates, currencies and other markets and to

manage its own credit risk. The Firm uses the same credit risk

management procedures to assess and approve potential credit
exposures when entering into derivative transactions as those

used for traditional lending.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts
and the reported derivative receivables (i.e., the MTM or fair

value of derivative contracts after taking into account the effects

of legally enforceable master netting agreements) at each of the

J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
59The $34 trillion of notional principal of the FirmÕs derivative con-
tracts outstanding at December 31, 2003, significantly exceeds
the possible credit losses that could arise from such transactions.

For most derivative transactions, the notional principal amount
does not change hands; it is simply used as a reference to calcu-

late payments. In terms of current credit risk exposure, the

appropriate measure of risk is the MTM value of the contract.

The MTM exposure represents the cost to replace the contracts

at current market rates should the counterparty default. When

JPMorgan Chase has more than one transaction outstanding

with a counterparty, and a legally enforceable master netting

agreement exists with the counterparty, the MTM exposure, less

collateral held, represents, in the FirmÕs view, the appropriate

measure of current credit risk with that counterparty as of the

reporting date. At December 31, 2003, the MTM value of deriv-ative receivables (after taking into account the effects of legally

enforceable master netting agreements) was $84 billion. Further,

after taking into account $36 billion of collateral held by the
Firm, the net current MTM credit exposure was $48 billion.
While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net
MTM value of the derivative receivables does not capture the

potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture

the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm

calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of

potential derivatives-related credit loss: 
Peak, DerivativeRisk Equivalent(ÒDREÓ) and Average exposure
(ÒAVGÓ).
This last measure is used as the basis for the FirmÕs Economic

credit exposure as defined on page 53 of this Annual Report.

These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits

where applicable. 
Peak exposure to a counterparty is an extreme measure of
exposure calculated at a 97.5% confidence level. However, the

total potential future credit risk embedded in the Firm's deriva-

tives portfolio is not the simple sum of all Peak client credit

risks. This is because, at the portfolio level, credit risk is reduced

by the fact that when offsetting transactions are done with sep-

arate counterparties, only one of the two trades can generate a
credit loss even if both counterparties were to default simulta-

neously. The Firm refers to this effect as market diversification,

and the Market-Diversified Peak(ÒMDPÓ) measure is a port-
folio aggregation of counterparty Peak measures, representing

the maximum losses at the 97.5% confidence level that would
occur if all counterparties defaulted under any one given market
scenario and timeframe. Derivative Risk Equivalent exposure is a measure that expresses
the riskiness of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be

equivalent to the riskiness of loan exposures. This is done by

equating the unexpected loss in a derivative counterparty expo-
sure (which takes into consideration both the loss volatility and

the credit rating of the counterparty) with the unexpected loss in

a loan exposure (which takes into consideration only the credit

rating of the counterparty). DRE is a less extreme measure of the

potential credit loss than Peak, and is the primary measure used

by the Firm for credit approval of derivative transactions. 
Finally, as described on page 53 of this Annual Report, Average
exposure is a measure of the expected MTM value of the FirmÕs

derivative receivables at future time periods. The three-year

average of the AVG is the basis of the FirmÕs Economic credit

exposure, while AVG exposure over the total life of the deriva-

tive contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes
and is used to calculate credit capital and the Credit Valuation

Adjustment (ÒCVAÓ). 
The chart below shows the exposure profiles to derivatives over
the next 10 years as calculated by the MDP, DRE and AVG met-

rics. All three measures generally show declining exposure after

the first year, if no new trades were added to the portfolio.

December 31, 2003
(in billions) $48The MTM value of the FirmÕs derivative receivables incorporates
an adjustment to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. This

is called CVA and was $635 million as of December 31, 2003,

compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002. The CVA is

based on the FirmÕs AVG to a counterparty, and on the counter-

partyÕs credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The primary

components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new deal

activity or unwinds, and changes in the underlying market envi-
ronment. The CVA decrease in 2003 was primarily due to the dra-
matic reduction in credit spreads during the year. For a discussion

of the impact of CVA on Trading revenue, see portfolio manage-

ment activity on pages 60Ð61 of this Annual Report.The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. 

The Firm hedges its exposure to changes in CVA by entering into

credit derivative transactions, as well as interest rate, foreign

exchange, equity and commodity derivatives transactions.ManagementÕs discussion and analysis

(a)Includes $2.2 billion and $10.1 billion at 2003 and 2002,respectively,of portfolio credit
derivatives.
JPMorgan Chase has limited counterparty exposure as a result 
of credit derivatives transactions. Of the $84 billion of total 

derivative receivables at December 31, 2003, approximately 

$3 billion, or 4%, was associated with credit derivatives, before

the benefit of collateral. The use of credit derivatives to manage

exposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on the bal-

ance sheet or the level of reported offÐbalance sheet commitments.
Portfolio management activityIn managing its commercial credit exposure, the Firm purchases 

single-name and portfolio credit derivatives to hedge its exposures.

As of December 31, 2003, the notional outstanding amount of
protection purchased via single-name and portfolio credit derivatives

was $35 billion and $2 billion, respectively. The Firm also diversifies

its exposures by providing (i.e., selling) small amounts of credit 

protection, which increases exposure to industries or clients where

the Firm has little or no client-related exposure. This activity is not

material to the FirmÕs overall credit exposure; credit protection sold

totaled $67 million in notional exposure at December 31, 2003.

derivative receivables exposure and collateral held by the Firm against this exposure were 
$84 billion and $36 billion,respectively.The $36 billion excludes $8 billion of collateral 

delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions;this collateral secures exposure that could 

arise in the existing portfolio of derivatives should the MTM of the clientsÕ transactions move 

in the FirmÕs favor.The $36 billion also excludes credit enhancements in the form of letters of 

credit and surety receivables.
The Firm actively pursues the use of collateral agreements to 
mitigate counterparty credit risk in derivatives. The percentage of

the FirmÕs derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements

increased to 78% on December 31, 2003, from 67% on

December 31, 2002. The increase of collateralized transactions

was driven largely by new collateral agreements. The Firm held

$36 billion of collateral as of December 31, 2003, compared with

$30 billion as of December 31, 2002. The Firm posted $27 billion
of collateral at year-end 2003, compared with $19 billion at the

end of 2002.Certain derivative and collateral agreements include provisions
that require both the Firm and the counterparty, upon specified

downgrades in their respective credit ratings, to post collateral

for the benefit of the other party. The impact on required collat-

eral of a single-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase
Bank, from its current rating of AA- to A+, would have been 

an additional $1.3 billion of collateral as of December 31, 2003.
The impact of a six-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase
Bank (from AA- to BBB-) would have been $3.7 billion of addi-

tional collateral from levels as of December 31, 2003. The amount

of additional collateral required upon downgrade moves in tan-

dem with the mark-to-market value of the derivatives portfolio
and ranged (with respect to a six-notch downgrade) from 

$3.4 billion to $4.2 billion throughout 2003, as the level of U.S.

interest rates changed. Certain derivatives contracts also provide

for termination of the contract, generally upon JPMorgan Chase
Bank being downgraded, at the then-existing MTM value of the
derivative receivables. 
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
61losses. This asymmetry in accounting treatment between loans
and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives uti-

lized in the portfolio management activities causes earnings

volatility that is not representative of the true changes in value

of the FirmÕs overall credit exposure. The MTM treatment of

both the FirmÕs credit derivative hedges (ÒshortÓ credit positions)

and the CVA, which reflects the credit quality of derivatives

counterparty exposure (ÒlongÓ credit positions), provides some

natural offset. Additionally, the Firm actively manages its com-

mercial credit exposure through loan sales. During 2003, the

Firm sold $5.2 billion of loans and commitments, of which 
$1.3 billion was criticized.The 2003 portfolio management activity resulted in $191 million
of losses included in Trading revenue. These losses included 

$746 million related to credit derivatives that were used to hedge

the FirmÕs credit exposure, of which approximately $504 million

was associated with credit derivatives used to hedge accrual lend-

ing activities and the remainder primarily hedged the credit risk

of MTM derivative receivables. The losses were generally driven

by an overall global tightening of credit spreads. The $746 million

loss was largely offset by $555 million of trading revenue gains

primarily related to the decrease in the MTM value of the CVA

due to credit spread tightening. During 2003, the quarterly port-

folio management Trading revenue results ranged from a net loss

of $12 million in the third quarter to a net loss of $119 million in

the second quarter. 
Dealer/client activity  JPMorgan ChaseÕs dealer activity in credit derivatives is client-

driven. The business acts as a market-maker in single-name
credit derivatives and also structures more complex transactions

for clientsÕ investment or risk management purposes. The credit

derivatives trading function operates within the same framework
as other market-making desks. Risk limits are established and

closely monitored.
As of December 31, 2003, the total notional amounts of protec-
tion purchased and sold by the dealer business were $264 billion

and $276 billion, respectively. The mismatch between these

notional amounts is attributable to the Firm selling protection on

large, diversified, predominantly investment-grade portfolios

(including the most senior tranches) and then hedging these
positions by buying protection on the more subordinated tranches

of the same portfolios. In addition, the Firm may use securities
to hedge certain derivative positions. Consequently, while there

is a mismatch in notional amounts of credit derivatives, the Firm

believes the risk positions are largely matched. 
Consumer credit portfolio
The FirmÕs managed consumer loan portfolio totaled $171.3 bil-

lion at December 31, 2003, an increase of 10% from 2002.

Consumer lendingÐrelated commitments increased by 17% to

$176.9 billion at December 31, 2003. The following table pres-

loans is primarily secured by first mortgages, and at December 31,

2003 comprised 43% of the total consumer portfolio. The risk of
these loans is the probability the consumer will default and that

the value of the home will be insufficient to cover the mortgage

plus carrying costs. Mortgage loans for 1Ð4 family residences at

December 31, 2003, increased by 10% compared with last year

to $54.5 billion. Home equity loans and home equity lines of
credit totaled $19.3 billion at 
December 31, 2003, an increase 
ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
62J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
of $4.6 billion, or 31%, from 2002. These loans and lines are
secured by first and second mortgages. The risks are similar to

those of first mortgages; however, loss severity can increase

when the Firm is in a second-lien position. As of December 31,
2003, 88% of home equity loans and lines of credit were

secured by second liens. Borrowers with home equity lines of

credit are approved for a line of credit for up to 10 years. The

Firm has a future funding liability in situations where the borrower

does not make use of the line of credit immediately but has 

the right to draw down the commitment at any time. As of
December 31, 2003, outstandings under home equity lines were

$16.6 billion and unused commitments were $23.4 billion

(included in the $28.8 billion of 1Ð4 family residential mortgage

lending-related commitments). The business actively manages

the unused portion of these commitments and freezes a commit-

ment when the borrower becomes delinquent. These accounts

are then subject to proactive default management, with the

objective of minimizing potential losses. The Firm analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,
which includes credit card receivables on the Consolidated bal-

ance sheet and those that have been securitized. Credit card cus-

tomers are initially approved for a specific revolving credit line.

For open accounts (those in good standing and able to transact),
the difference between the approved line and the balance out-

standing in the customerÕs account is referred to as Òopen-to-

buy.Ó The Firm is exposed to changes in the customerÕs credit

standing and therefore must calculate the aggregate size of this

unused exposure and manage the potential credit risk. The size

of the credit line and resulting open-to-buy balance is adjusted

by the Firm based on the borrowerÕs payment and general credit

performance.Managed credit card receivables increased by 
$1.3 billion, or 2%, during 2003. The managed net charge-off

rate of 5.87% was unchanged from 2002. 
Automobile financings grew by 15% to approximately $38.7 bil-
lion, while the net charge-off rate improved from 0.57% in

2002 to 0.45% in 2003.The following chart presents the geographical concentration of the U.S. consumer loans by region for the years ended December 3

ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
64J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Nonperforming assets decreased by $1.7 billion, or 35%, during
the year ended December 31, 2003, to $3.1 billion. The decrease

was due to activity in the commercial portfolio: total reductions,

including repayments, loan sales and net charge-offs exceeded

new additions, resulting in net reductions of $1.7 billion. By

contrast, there were commercial net additions during 2002. A

decline in exposure to the Telecom services, Utilities and Media

industries accounted for more than half of the overall $1.7 bil-

lion decrease.
Commercial
Commercial nonperforming loans decreased by 45%, to 

$2.0 billion as of December 31, 2003, from $3.7 billion at year-

end 2002. Over the same period, nonperforming commercial

loans as a percentage of total commercial loans fell to 2.42%

from 4.01%. Commercial loan net charge-offs in 2003 were

$816 million, compared with $1.9 billion in 2002, the result of

improved credit quality in the portfolio and increased recoveries

resulting from restructurings. There were no net charge-offs of
commercial lendingÐrelated commitments in 2003, compared

with $212 million in 2002. The average annual net charge-off

rate for commercial loans improved significantly, to 0.91% in

2003 from 1.93% in 2002.
Commercial net charge-offs in 2004 are expected to decline,
but at a slower pace than in the second half of 2003.ConsumerThe $21 million decrease in consumer nonperforming loans

reflected improved credit quality in the portfolio. While net
charge-offs increased by $92 million during the year reflecting a

10% growth in the portfolio, the average annual net charge-off

rate declined to 1.96% from 2.30% during 2002. 
In 2004, the amount of gross charge-offs is expected to increase
due to growth in outstandings, but net charge-off rates are

expected to remain stable.
Allowance for credit losses 
JPMorgan ChaseÕs Allowance for credit losses is intended to

cover probable credit losses, including losses where the asset is

not specifically identified or the size of the loss has not been
determined. At least quarterly, the FirmÕs Risk Management

Committee reviews the Allowance for credit losses relative to the

risk profile of the FirmÕs credit portfolio and current economic

conditions. The allowance is adjusted based on that review if, in

managementÕs judgment, changes are warranted. The allowance

includes specific and expected loss components and a residual

component. For further discussion of the components of the
Allowance for credit losses, see Critical accounting estimates

used by the Firm on pages 75Ð76 and Note 12 on page 100

of this Annual Report. At December 31, 2003, management
deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate to

absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yet identifiable.

J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
65Loans The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was
$917 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of 43% from

year-end 2002. The decrease was attributable to the improve-

ment in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio, as

well as the reduction in the size of the portfolio. 
The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was
$454 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of 26% from year-

end 2002. The decrease reflected an improvement in the average

quality of the loan portfolio, as well as the improving credit envi-

ronment, which affected inputs to the expected loss model.
The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was$2.3 billion at December 31, 2003, a decrease of 4% from year-

end 2002. Although the consumer managed loan portfolio
increased by 10%, the businesses that drove the increase, Home

Finance and Auto Finance, have collateralized products with

lower expected loss rates. The residual component of the allowance was $895 million at
December 31, 2003. The residual component, which incorpo-

rates management's judgment, addresses uncertainties that 

are not considered in the formula-based commercial specific 

and expected components of the allowance for credit losses.
The $121 million increase addressed uncertainties in the eco-
nomic environment and concentrations in the commercial loan

portfolio that existed during the first half of 2003. In the sec-
ond half of the year, as commercial credit quality continued to

improve and the commercial allowance declined further, the

residual component was reduced as well. At December 31,
2003, the residual component represented approximately 20%

of the total allowance for loan losses, within the FirmÕs target

range of between 10% and 20%. The Firm anticipates that if
the current positive trend in economic conditions and credit

quality continues, the commercial and residual components will

continue to be reduced.
Lending-related commitmentsTo provide for the risk of loss inherent in the credit-extension
process, management also computes specific and expected loss

components as well as a residual component for commercial

lendingÐrelated commitments. This is computed using a

methodology similar to that used for the commercial loan port-

folio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of

drawdown. The allowance decreased by 11% to $324 million

as of December 31, 2003, due to improvement in the criticized

portion of the FirmÕs lending-related commitments.

MRM works in partnership with the business segments, which are expected to maintain strong risk discipline at all levels. For

example, risk-taking businesses have Middle Office functions that

act independently from trading personnel and are responsible for
verifying risk exposures they take. Weekly meetings are held
between MRM and the heads of risk-taking businesses, to discuss
and decide on risk exposures in the context of the market envi-

ronment and client flows.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
67There are also groups that report to the Chief Financial Officer
with some responsibility for market risk-related activities. For

example, within the Finance area, the valuation control functions

are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the valuations of

positions that expose the Firm to market risk.Positions that expose the Firm to market risk are classified into two
categories. Trading risk includes positions held as part of a business

whose strategy is to trade, make markets or take positions for the
FirmÕs own trading account; gains and losses in these positions are

reported in Trading revenue. Nontrading risk includes mortgage
banking positions held for longer-term investment and positions

used to manage the FirmÕs asset/liability exposures. In most cases,

unrealized gains and losses in these positions are accounted for 

at fair value, with the gains and losses reported in Net income or

Other comprehensive income.
Tools used to measure risksBecause no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk,
the Firm uses several measures, both statistical and nonstatistical,

including: ¥ Statistical risk measures
- Value-at-Risk (ÒVARÓ)

- Risk identification for large exposures (ÒRIFLEÓ)
¥ Nonstatistical risk measures
- Economic-value stress tests

- Net interest income stress tests

- Other measures of position size and sensitivity to market
movesVal
ue-at-Risk JPMorgan ChaseÕs statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the
potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market

environment and provides a consistent cross-business measure

of risk profiles and levels of risk diversification. VAR is used to

compare risks across businesses, to monitor limits and to allo-

cate economic capital to the business segments. VAR provides

risk transparency in a normal trading environment.  
Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VAR
calculation that includes both trading and nontrading activities.
JPMorgan ChaseÕs VAR calculation is highly granular, comprising

more than 1.5 million positions and 240,000 pricing series (e.g.,

securities prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates). For a

substantial portion of its exposure, the Firm has implemented

full-revaluation VAR, which, management believes, generates

the most accurate results. 
To calculate VAR, the Firm uses historical simulation, which
measures risk across instruments and portfolios in a consistent,

comparable way. This approach assumes that historical changes

in market value are representative of future changes. The simu-

lation is based on market data for the previous 12 months.
The Firm calculates VAR using a one-day time horizon and a
99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to
incur losses greater than that predicted by VAR estimates only

once in every 100 trading days, or about 2.5 times a year. 
All statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty, depending
on the assumptions they employ. The Firm prefers historical 

simulation, because it involves fewer assumptions about the distribution of portfolio losses than parameter-based method-

ologies. In addition, the Firm regularly assesses the quality of 

the market data, since their accuracy is critical to computing VAR. Nevertheless, because VAR is based on historical market
data, it may not accurately reflect future risk during environ-

ments in which market volatility is changing. In addition, the VAR measure on any 
particular day may not be indicative offuture risk levels, since positions and market conditions may

both change over time.While VAR is a valuable tool for evaluating relative risks and
aggregating risks across businesses, it only measures the poten-

tial volatility of daily revenues. Profitability and risk levels over

longer time periods Ð a fiscal quarter or a year Ð may be only
loosely related to the average value of VAR over those periods.

First, while VAR measures potential fluctuations around average

daily revenue, the average itself could reflect significant gains or

losses; for example, from client revenues that accompany risk-

taking activities. Second, large trading revenues may result from

positions taken over longer periods of time. For example, a busi-
ness may maintain an exposure to rising or falling interest rates

over a period of weeks or months. If the market exhibits a long-
term trend over that time, the business could experience large

gains or losses, even though revenue volatility on each individual

day may have been small.VAR BacktestingTo evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts
daily backtesting of VAR against actual financial results, based

on daily market riskÐrelated revenue. Market riskÐrelated revenue

is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-market
trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income,

brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. 

The FirmÕs definition of market riskÐrelated revenue is consistent

with the Federal Reserve BoardÕs implementation of the Basel

Committee's market risk capital rules. The histogram below 
illustrates the FirmÕs daily market riskÐrelated revenue for trading

businesses for 2003. The chart shows that the Firm posted posi-

tive daily market riskÐrelated revenue on 235 out of 260 days 

in 2003, with 170 days exceeding $25 million. Losses were sus-

tained on 25 days; nine of those days were in the third quarter,

primarily driven by poor overall trading results. The largest daily

trading loss during the year was $100 million.ManagementÕs discussion and analysis

The inset in the histogram examines the 25 days on which theFirm posted trading losses and depicts the amount by which VAR

was greater than the actual loss on each day. There was one day

on which trading losses exceeded VAR by approximately 10%, a

performance statistically consistent with the FirmÕs 99% confi-

dence level. During the third quarter, there was an additional day
on which the FirmÕs losses exceeded VAR; these losses were
attributable to certain positions in the mortgage banking busi-
ness, which were then included in the FirmÕs trading portfolio,

but which are now included in the nontrading portfolio with

other mortgage banking positions.< (40)(20) > < (10)(10) > < 00 > < 1010 > < 2020 > < 3030 > < 4040 > < 5050 > < 6060 > < 7070 > < 8080 > < 9090 > < 100100 > < 110 > 110(30) > < (20)(40) > < (30)Daily market risk-related revenue for trading businesses

0Economic-value stress testingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in nor-
mal markets, stress testing captures the FirmÕs exposure to

unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. Stress testing

is equally important as VAR in measuring and controlling risk.

Stress testing enhances the understanding of the FirmÕs risk pro-

file and loss potential and is used for monitoring limits, cross-

business risk measurement and economic capital allocation.
Economic-value stress tests measure the potential change in the
value of the FirmÕs portfolios. Applying economic-value stress

tests helps the Firm understand how the economic value of its
balance sheet (not the amounts reported under GAAP) would

change under certain scenarios. The Firm conducts economic-
value stress tests for both its trading and its nontrading activities,

using the same scenarios for both.The Firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month using multi-
ple scenarios. Several macroeconomic event-related scenarios are

evaluated across the Firm, w
ith shocks to roughly 10,000 market
prices specified for each scenario. Additional scenarios focus onthe risks predominant in individual business segments 
and includescenarios that focus on the potential for adverse moves in com-
plex portfolios. Scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect changes
in the FirmÕs risk profile and economic events. Stress-test results,

trends and explanations are provided each month to the FirmÕs 

senior management and to the lines of business, to help them 

better measure and manage risks and to understand event riskÐ

sensitive positions. The FirmÕs stress-test methodology assumes that, during an
actual stress event, no management action would be taken to

change the risk profile of portfolios. This assumption captures

the decreased liquidity that often occurs with abnormal markets

and results, in the FirmÕs view, in a conservative stress-test result.
It is important to note that VAR results cannot be directly corre-
lated to stress-test loss results for three reasons. First, stress-test

losses are calculated at varying dates each month, while VAR is
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
69performed daily and disclosed at the period-end date. Second,VAR and stress tests are two distinct risk measurements yielding
very different loss potentials. Thus, although the same trading

portfolios are used for both tests, VAR is based on a distribution

of one-day historical losses measured over the most recent one

year; by contrast, stress testing subjects the portfolio to more

extreme, larger moves over a longer time horizon (e.g., 2Ð3

weeks). Third, as VAR and stress tests are distinct risk measure-

ments, the impact of portfolio diversification can vary greatly.

For VAR, markets can change in patterns over a one-year time

horizon, moving from highly correlated to less so; in stress test-

ing, the focus is on a single event and the associated correla-

tions in an extreme market situation. As a result, while VAR over

a given time horizon can be lowered by a diversification benefit

in the portfolio, this benefit would not necessarily manifest itself
in stress-test scenarios, which assume large, coherent moves

across all markets.
Net interest income stress testingThe VAR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the

total economic sensitivity of the FirmÕs balance sheet to changes

in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on

reported Net income is also critical. The Firm conducts simula-tions of Net interest income for its nontrading activities under a

variety of interest rate scenarios, which are consistent with the

scenarios used for economic-value stress testing.
Net interest income stress tests measure the potential change in
the FirmÕs NII over the next 12 months. These stress tests highlight

exposures to various interest rateÐsensitive factors, such as rates
(e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits andchanges in product mix. These stress tests also take into account

forecasted balance sheet changes, such as asset sales and securiti-

zations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior.
RIFLEIn addition to VAR, JPMorgan Chase employs the Risk identifica-

tion for large exposures (ÒRIFLEÓ) methodology as another sta-

tistical risk measure. The Firm requires that all market risk
Ðtakingbusinesses self-assess their risks to unusual and specific events.
Individuals who manage risk positions, particularly complex posi-
tions, identify potential worst-case losses that could arise from

an unusual or specific event, such as a potential tax change, and
estimate the probabilities of such losses. Through the FirmÕs

RIFLE system, this information is then directed to the appropriate

level of management, thereby permitting the Firm to identify

further earnings vulnerabilities not adequately covered by VAR

and stress testing.
Nonstatistical risk measuresNonstatistical risk measures other than stress testing include net

open positions, basis point values, option sensitivities, position
concentrations and position turnover. These measures provide

additional information on an exposureÕs size and the direction in

which it is moving. Nonstatistical measures are used for moni-

toring limits, one-off approvals and tactical controls.

ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
70J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Trading RiskMajor risks Interest rates:
Interest rate risk (which includes credit spread risk)
involves the potential decline in net income or financial condition
due to adverse changes in market interest rates, which may result

in changes to NII, securities valuations, and other interest-sensitive

revenues and expenses. Foreign exchange, equities and commodities: 
These risksinvolve the potential decline in net income or financial condition
due to adverse changes in foreign exchange, equities or commodi-

ties markets, whether due to proprietary positions taken by the

Firm, or due to a decrease in the level of client activity. 
Hedge fund investments: The Firm invests in numerous hedge
funds that have various strategic goals, investment strategies,
industry concentrations, portfolio sizes and management styles.
Fund investments are passive long-term investments. Individual

hedge funds may have exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange,

equity and commodity risk within their portfolio risk structures.
Trading VAR
The largest contributor to trading VAR was interest rate risk.
Before portfolio diversification, interest rate risk accounted for

roughly 60% of the average Trading Portfolio VAR. The diversifi-
cation effect, which on average reduced the daily average Trading

Portfolio VAR by $38 million in 2003, reflects the fact that the

largest losses for different positions and risks do not typically

occur at the same time. The risk of a portfolio of positions is
therefore usually less than the sum of the risks of the positions

themselves. The degree of diversification is determined both by

the extent to which different market variables tend to move

together, and by the extent to which different businesses have

similar positions.The increase in year-end VAR was driven by an increase in the
VAR for equities risk, which was attributable to a significantincrease in customer-driven business in equity options. In general,

over the course of a year, VAR exposures can vary significantly as

trading positions change and market volatility fluctuates.Economic-value stress testingThe following table represents the worst-case potential economic-

value stress-test loss (pre-tax) in the FirmÕs trading portfolio as pre-

dicted by stress-test scenarios:

(a)  Amounts have been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain mortgage banking 
positions from the trading portfolio to the nontrading portfolio.
The potential stress-test loss as of December 4, 2003, is the result of
the ÒEquity Market CollapseÓ stress scenario, which is broadly mod-

eled on the events of October 1987. Under this scenario, global
equity markets suffer a sharp reversal after a long sustained rally;

equity prices decline globally; volatilities for equities, interest rates

and credit products increase dramatically for short maturities and

less so for longer maturities; sovereign bond yields decline moder-

ately; and swap spreads and credit spreads widen moderately. 
Nontrading RiskMajor risk Ð Interest ratesThe execution of the FirmÕs core business strategies, the delivery

of products and services to its customers, and the discretionary

positions the Firm undertakes to risk-manage structural exposures

give rise to interest rate risk in its nontrading activities. 
This exposure can result from a variety of factors, including differ-
ences in the timing between the maturity or repricing of assets,

liabilities and offÐbalance sheet instruments. Changes in the level

and shape of interest rate curves may also create interest rate risk,

since the repricing characteristics of the FirmÕs assets do not neces-

sarily match those of its liabilities. The Firm is also exposed to basis
risk, which is the difference in the repricing characteristics of two

floating-rate indices, such as the prime rate and 3-month LIBOR. In
addition, some of the FirmÕs products have embedded optionality

that may have an impact on pricing and balance levels.  The Firm manages exposure in its structural interest rate activities
on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis. Business units transfer
their interest rate risk to Global Treasury through a transfer pricing

system, which takes into account the elements of interest rate

exposure that can be hedged in financial markets. These elements

include current balance and contractual rates of interest, con-

tractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment 

experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities and rate

indices used for re-pricing. All transfer pricing assumptions are

reviewed on a semiannual basis and must be approved by the
FirmÕs Capital Committee.
The FirmÕs mortgage banking activities also give rise to complex
interest rate risks. The interest rate exposure from the FirmÕs mort-

gage banking activities is a result of option and basis risks. Option

risk arises from prepayment features in mortgages and MSRs, and

from the probability of newly originated mortgage commitments

actually closing. Basis risk results from different relative movements

between mortgage rates and other interest rates. These risks 

are managed through hedging programs specific to the different

mortgage banking activities. Potential changes in the market
value of MSRs and increased amortization levels of MSRs are

managed via a risk management program that attempts to offset

changes in the market value of MSRs with changes in the market
value of derivatives and investment securities. A similar approach

is implemented to manage the interest rate and option risks 

associated with the FirmÕs mortgage origination business.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
71Nontrading VAR
For nontrading activities that involve market risk, VAR measures
the amount of potential change in their economic value; however,

it is not a measure of repor
ted revenues, 
since those activities are
not marked to market through earnings.
The increase in average, maximum and December 31 nontrading
portfolio VAR was primarily attributable to the increase in market

volatility during the 2003 third quarter, and to the rise in interest

rates in the second half of 2003, which increased the sensitivity of

mortgage instruments to the basis risk between mortgage rates
and other interest rates.
Economic-value stress testingThe Firm conducts both economic-value and NII stress tests on its

nontrading activities. Economic-value stress tests measure the poten-

tial change in the value of these portfolios under the same scenarios
used to evaluate the trading portfolios. 
The following table represents the potential worst-case economic-
value stress-test loss (pre-tax) in the FirmÕs nontrading portfolio as

predicted by stress-test scenarios:

$(967)$(523)$(1,566)$(556)
The potential stress-test loss as of December 4, 2003, is the result
of the ÒCredit CrunchÓ stress scenario, which is broadly based on

the events of 1997Ð98. Under that scenario, political instability in
emerging markets leads to a flight to quality; sovereign bond

yields decline moderately; the U.S. dollar declines against the
euro and Japanese yen; credit spreads widen sharply; mortgage

spreads widen; and equity prices decline moderately.
Net interest income stress testingThe following table shows the change in the FirmÕs NII over the next

12 months that would result from uniform increases or decreases of

100 basis points in all interest rates. It also shows the largest decline

in the FirmÕs NII under the same stress-test scenarios utilized for the

trading portfolio. At year-end 2003, JPMorgan ChaseÕs largest poten-

tial NII stress-test loss was estimated at $160 million, primarily the

result of increased funding costs.

(88)(133)Nonstatistical measuresThe Firm also calculates exposures to directional interest rate
changes and to changes in the spread between the swap curve

and other basis risks. At year-end, the market value of the FirmÕs

nontrading positions did not have a significant exposure to

increases or decreases in interest 
rates. However, the FirmÕs non-
trading positions maintain an exposure to the spread between

mortgage rates and swap rates; at year-end the Firm was

exposed to a widening of this spread.     
Capital allocation for market riskThe Firm allocates market risk capital guided by the principle 
that capital should reflect the extent to which risks are present 

in businesses. Daily VAR, monthly stress-test results and other

factors determine appropriate capital charges for major business

segments. The VAR measure captures a large number of one-day

price moves, while stress tests capture a smaller number of very

large price moves. The Firm allocates market risk capital to each
business segment according to a formula that weights that seg-

mentÕs VAR and stress-test exposures.
Risk monitoring and control
LimitsMarket risk is primarily controlled through a series of limits. The

sizes of the limits reflect the FirmÕs risk appetite after extensive

analyses of the market environment and business strategy. The

analyses examine factors such as market volatility, product liquidity,

business track record, and management experience and depth.
The Firm maintains different levels of limits. Corporate-level 
limits encompass VAR calculations and stress-test loss advisories.

Similarly, business-segment levels include limits on VAR calcula-

tions, nonstatistical measurements and P&L loss advisories.

Businesses are responsible for adhering to established limits,

against which exposures are monitored and reported daily. An

exceeded limit is reported immediately to senior management,

and the affected business unit must take appropriate action to

comply with the limit. If the business cannot do this within an
acceptable timeframe, senior management is consulted on the
appropriate action. 
MRM regularly reviews and updates risk limits, and the FirmÕs
Risk Management Committee reviews and approves risk limits 

at least twice a year. MRM further controls the FirmÕs exposure 

by specifically designating approved financial instruments for

each business unit.ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
72J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Qualitative reviewMRM also performs periodic reviews of both businesses and prod-
ucts with exposure to market risk in order to assess the ability of

the businesses to control market risk. The business managementÕs

strategy, market conditions, product details and effectiveness of

risk controls are reviewed. Specific recommendations for improve-

ments are made to management.
Model reviewMany of the FirmÕs financial instruments cannot be valued based

on quoted market prices but are instead valued using pricing

models. Such models are used for management of risk positions,

such as reporting risk against limits, and for valuation. The Firm

reviews the models it uses to assess model appropriateness and
consistency across businesses. The model reviews consider a 
number of issues: appropriateness of the model, assessing the
extent to which it accurately reflects the characteristics of the

transaction and captures its significant risks; independence and

reliability of data sources; appropriateness and adequacy of
numerical algorithms; and sensitivity to input parameters or other
assumptions which cannot be priced from the market.
Reviews are conducted for new or changed models, as well as
previously accepted models. Re-reviews assess whether there

have been any material changes to the accepted models;
whether there have been any changes in the product or market

that may impact the modelÕs validity; and whether there are 

theoretical or competitive developments that may require

reassessment of the modelÕs adequacy. For a summary of valua-
tions based on models, see Critical accounting estimates used
by the Firm on pages 76Ð77 of this Annual Report.
Operational risk managementOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed processes or systems,

human factors, or external events. 
OverviewOperational risk is inherent in each of the FirmÕs businesses and
support activities. Operational risk can manifest itself in various
ways, including errors, business interruptions, inappropriate

behavior of employees and vendors that do not perform in
accordance with outsourcing arrangements. These events can

potentially result in financial losses and other damage to the

Firm, including reputational harm.
To monitor and control operational risk, the Firm maintains a
system of comprehensive policies and a control framework

designed to provide a sound and well controlled operational

environment. The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate

levels, in light of the FirmÕs financial strength, the characteristics

of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, and the com-
petitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.
Notwithstanding these control measures, the Firm incurs opera-
tional losses. The FirmÕs approach to operational risk management

is intended to mitigate such losses.Operational risk management practicesThroughout 2003, JPMorgan Chase continued to execute a multi-

year plan, begun in 2001, for an integrated approach that empha-

sizes active management of operational risk throughout the Firm.

The objective of this effort is to supplement the traditional control-

based approach to operational risk with risk measures, tools and

disciplines that are risk-specific, consistently applied and utilized

Firm-wide. Key themes for this effort are transparency of informa-

tion, escalation of key issues and accountability for issue resolution.

Ultimate responsibility for the FirmÕs operational risk management

practices resides with the Chief Risk Officer. The components are:
Governance structure:
The governance structure provides the
framework for the FirmÕs operational risk management activities.

Primary responsibility for managing operational risk rests with

business managers. These individuals are responsible for estab-

lishing and maintaining appropriate internal control procedures

for their respective businesses. 
The Operational Risk Committee, which meets quarterly, is com-
posed of senior operational risk and finance managers from

each of the businesses. In addition, each of the businesses must
maintain business control committees to oversee their opera-

tional risk management practices.Self-assessment process:
In 2003, JPMorgan Chase continuedto refine its Firm-wide self-assessment process. The goal of the

process was for each business to identify the key operational risks

specific to its environment and assess the degree to which it

maintained appropriate controls. Action plans were developed for

control issues identified, and businesses are to be held account-

able for tracking and resolving these issues on a timely basis. 
Self-assessments were completed by the businesses through the
use of Horizon, a software application developed by the Firm.

With the aid of Horizon, all businesses were required to perform
semiannual self-assessments in 2003. Going forward, the Firm

will utilize the self-assessment process as a dynamic risk man-

agement tool. Operational risk-event monitoring:The Firm has a process
for reporting operational risk-event data, permitting analyses of

errors and losses as well as trends. Such analyses, performed

both at a line-of-business level and by risk event type, enable
identification of root causes associated with risk events faced by

the businesses. Where available, the internal data can be sup-

plemented with external data for comparative analysis with

industry patterns. The data reported will enable the Firm to

back-test against self-assessment results. 
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
73Integrated reporting:
The Firm is presently designing an oper-
ational risk architecture model to integrate the above individual

components into a unified, web-based tool. When fully imple-
mented, this model will enable the Firm to enhance its reporting

and analysis of operational risk data, leading to improved risk

management and financial performance. Audit alignment:In addition to conducting independent inter-nal audits, the FirmÕs internal audit group provided guidance on

the design and implementation of the operational risk frame-
work. This guidance has helped further the Firm-wide imple-
mentation of the framework, which in turn has led to a stronger

overall control environment. The internal audit group utilizes the

business self-assessment results to help focus its internal audits

on operational control issues. The group also reviews the effec-

tiveness and accuracy of the business self-assessment process

during the conduct of its audits.Operational Risk CategoriesFor purposes of analysis and aggregation, the Firm breaks oper-

ational risk events down into five primary categories:¥ Clients, products and business practices
¥ Fraud, theft and unauthorized activity

¥ Execution and processing errors

¥ Employment practices and workplace safety

¥ Physical asset and infrastructure damage
Compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404The Firm intends to use, as much as possible, its existing corpo-
rate governance and operational risk management practices to

satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 

Act regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Firm

is currently in the process of evaluating the requirements of

Section 404 and of implementing additional procedures into its

existing practices. The Firm intends to be in full compliance with

Annual Report.Capital allocation for operational andbusiness riskDuring 2003, the Firm implemented a new risk-based capitalallocation methodology which estimates operational and busi-
ness risk independently, on a bottoms-up basis, and allocates

capital to each component. Implementation of the new
methodology in 2003 resulted in an overall lower amount of

capital allocated to the lines of business with respect to opera-

tional and business risks.The operational risk capital model is based on actual losses andpotential scenario-based stress losses, with adjustments to the

capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control

environment and with a potential offset for the use of risk-

transfer products. The Firm believes the model is consistent with

the proposed Basel II Accord 
and expects to propose it eventuallyfor qualification under the Advanced Measurement Approach
for operational risk.Business risk is defined as the risk associated with volatility in theFirmÕs earnings due to factors not captured by other parts of its

economic-capital framework. Such volatility can arise from inef-

fective design or execution of business strategies, volatile eco-
nomic or financial market activity, changing client expectations

and demands, and restructuring to adjust for changes in the com-

petitive environment. For business risk, capital is allocated to each

business based on historical revenue volatility and measures of

fixed and variable expenses. Earnings volatility arising from other

risk factors, such as credit, market, or operational risk, is excluded

from the measurement of business risk capital, as those factors

are captured under their respective risk capital models.
Reputation and Fiduciary risk A firmÕs success depends not only on its prudent management 

of credit, market, operational and business risks, but equally on

the maintenance of its reputation among many constituents Ð

clients, investors, regulators, as well as the general public Ð for

business practices of the highest quality.
Attention to its reputation has always been a key aspect of the
FirmÕs practices, and maintenance of reputation is the responsi-

bility of everyone at the Firm. JPMorgan Chase bolsters this indi-
vidual responsibility in many ways: the Worldwide Rules of

Conduct, training, policies and oversight functions that approve

transactions. These oversight functions include a Conflicts Office,

which examines transactions with the potential to create con-

flicts of interest or role for the Firm. 
In addition, the Firm maintains a Fiduciary Risk ManagementCommittee (ÒFRMCÓ) to oversee fiduciary-related risks that may

produce significant losses or reputational damage, and that are not

covered elsewhere by the corporate risk management oversight

structure. The primary goal of the fiduciary risk management func-

tion is to ensure that a business, in providing investment or risk

management products or services, performs at the appropriate

standard relative to its relationship with a client, whether it be

fiduciary or nonfiduciary in nature. A particular focus of the FRMC

is the policies and practices that address a businessÕs responsibilities

to a client, including the policies and practices that address client

suitability determination, disclosure obligations and performance

expectations with respect to the investment and risk management

products or services being provided. In this way, the FRMC provides

oversight of the FirmÕs efforts to measure, monitor and control the

risks that may arise in the delivery of such products or services to

clients, as well as those stemming from its fiduciary responsibilities

undertaken on behalf of employees.The Firm has an additional structure to account for potential
adverse effects on its reputation from transactions with clients,

especially complex derivatives and structured finance transactions.

This structure, implemented in 2002, reinforces the FirmÕs proce-

dures for examining transactions in terms of appropriateness, 

ethical issues and reputational risk, and it intensifies the FirmÕs

Critical accounting estimates used by the Firm scrutiny of the purpose and effect of its transactions from the
clientÕs point of view, with the goal that these transactions are

not used to mislead investors or others. The structure operates

at three levels: as part of every businessÕs transaction approval

process; through review by regional Policy Review Committees;

and through oversight by the Policy Review Office.
Business transaction approvalPrimary responsibility for adherence to the policies and proce-

dures designed to address reputation risk lies with the business

units conducting the transactions in question. The FirmÕs transac-

tion approval process requires review and sign-off from, among

others, internal legal/compliance, conflicts, tax and accounting

policy groups. Transactions involving an SPE established by the

Firm receive particular scrutiny and must comply with a Special-

Purpose Vehicle Policy, designed to ensure that every such entity

is properly approved, documented, monitored and controlled.
Regional policy review committees
Business units are also required to submit to regional Policy Review

Committees proposed transactions that may heighten reputation
Private equity risk managementRisk managementJPMP employs processes for risk measurement and control of

private equity risk that are similar to those used for other busi-

nesses within the Firm. The processes are coordinated with the

FirmÕs overall approach to market and concentration risk. Private

equity risk is initially monitored through the use of industry and

geographic limits. Additionally, to manage the pace of new

investments, a ceiling on the amount of annual private equity
investment activity has been established.JPMPÕs public equity holdings create a significant exposure to
general declines in the equity markets. To gauge that risk, VAR

and stress-test exposures are calculated in the same way as 

they are for the FirmÕs trading and nontrading portfolios. JPMP

management undertakes frequent reviews of its public security

holdings as part of a disciplined approach to sales and hedging

issues. Hedging programs are limited but are considered when
practical and as circumstances dictate. Over time, the Firm may

change the nature and type of hedges it enters into, as well as

close hedging positions altogether.
Capital allocation for private equity riskInternal capital is allocated to JPMPÕs public equities portfolio

based on stress scenarios which reflect the potential loss inher-

ent in the portfolio in the event of a large equity market
decline. Capital is also allocated for liquidity risk, which results

from the contractual sales restrictions to which some holdings

are subject. For private equities, capital is allocated based on a

long-term equity market stress scenario that is consistent with

the investment time horizons associated with these holdings.
For these investments, additional capital is allocated against the
risk of an unexpectedly large number of write-offs or write-

downs. The Firm refined its methodology for measuring private

equity risk during the second quarter of 2003. It now assigns a
moderately higher amount of capital for the risk in the private
equity portfolio, most of which is assigned to JPMP. 
risk Ð particularly a clientÕs motivation and its intended financial
disclosure of the transaction. The committees approve, reject or

require further clarification on or changes to the transactions.
The members of these committees are senior representatives of

the business and support units in the region. The committees

may escalate transaction review to the Policy Review Office.
Policy Review Office
The Policy Review Office is the most senior approval level for

client transactions involving reputation risk issues. The mandate

of the Office is to opine on specific transactions brought by the

Regional Committees and consider changes in policies or prac-

tices relating to reputation risk. The head of the office consults

with the FirmÕs most senior executives on specific topics and pro-

vides regular updates. Aside from governance and guidance on

specific transactions, the objective of the policy review process is

to reinforce a culture, through a Òcase studyÓ approach, that

ensures that all employees, regardless of seniority, understand

the basic principles of reputation risk control and can recognize

and address issues as they arise.
The FirmÕs accounting policies and use of estimates are integral
to understanding the reported results. The FirmÕs most complex

accounting estimates require managementÕs judgment to ascer-

tain the valuation of assets and liabilities. The Firm has estab-
lished detailed policies and control procedures intended to

ensure valuation methods, including any judgments made as

part of such methods, are well controlled, independently

reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. 
In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure
that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an

appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for deter-

mining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. 
The following is a brief description of the FirmÕs critical accounting
estimates involving significant management valuation judgments.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
75Allowance for Credit Losses 
JPMorgan ChaseÕs Allowance for credit losses covers the com-
mercial and consumer loan portfolios as well as the FirmÕs port-

folio of commercial lending-related commitments. The

allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the
FirmÕs loan assets for probable credit losses as of the balance

sheet date in accordance with generally accepted accounting

principles. Management also computes an allowance for lending-
related commercial commitments using a methodology similar
to that used for the commercial loan portfolio. For a further 

discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the FirmÕs

Allowance for credit losses, see Note 12 on page 100 of this

Annual Report.Commercial loans and lending-related commitments
The methodology for calculating both the Allowance for loan
losses and the Allowance for lending-related commitments

involves significant judgment. First and foremost, it involves the

early identification of credits that are deteriorating. Second, it

involves management judgment to derive loss factors. The Firm uses a risk rating system to determine the credit quality
of its loans. Commercial loans are reviewed for information

affecting the obligorÕs ability to fulfill its obligations. In assessing

the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered

include the obligorÕs debt capacity and financial flexibility, the

level of the obligorÕs earnings, the amount and sources of repay-

ment, the level and nature of contingencies, management

strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor

operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical

information and current information as well as subjective assess-

ment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factor over another

or considering additional factors that may be relevant in deter-

mining the risk rating of a particular loan, but which are not

currently an explicit part of the FirmÕs methodology, could

impact the risk rating assigned by the Firm to that loan.Management also applies its judgment to derive loss factorsassociated with each credit facility. These loss factors are deter-

mined by facility structure, collateral and type of obligor.

Wherever possible, the Firm uses independent, verifiable data or

the FirmÕs own historical loss experience in its models for esti-

mating these loss factors. Many factors can affect manage-

mentÕs estimates of specific loss and expected loss, including

volatility of default probabilities, rating migrations and loss

severity. For example, judgment is required to determine how

many years of data to include when estimating the possible
severity of the loss. If a full credit cycle is not captured in the

data, then estimates may be inaccurate. Likewise, judgment is
applied to determine whether the loss-severity factor should be
calculated as an average over the entire credit cycle or whether

to apply the loss-severity factor implied at a particular point in
the credit cycle. The application of different loss-severity factors

would change the amount of the allowance for credit losses
determined appropriate by the Firm. Similarly, there are judg-
ments as to which external data on default probabilities should

be used, and when they should be used. Choosing data that are

not reflective of the FirmÕs specific loan portfolio characteristics

could affect loss estimates.
As noted above, the FirmÕs allowance for loan losses is sensitive
to the risk rating assigned to a loan. Assuming a one-notch
downgrade in the FirmÕs internal risk ratings for all its commercial

loans, the allowance for loan losses for the commercial portfolio

would increase by approximately $470 million at December 31,

2003. Furthermore, assuming a 10% increase in the loss severity

on all downgraded non-criticized loans, the allowance for com-
mercial loans would increase by approximately $50 million at

December 31, 2003. These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical

and should be used with caution. The purpose of these analyses
is to provide an indication of the impact risk ratings and loss

severity have on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses
for commercial loans. It is not intended to imply managementÕs

expectation of future deterioration in risk ratings or changes in

loss severity. Given the process the Firm follows in determining

the risk ratings of its loans and assessing loss severity, manage-

ment believes the risk ratings and loss severities currently

assigned to commercial loans are appropriate. Furthermore, the

likelihood of a one-notch downgrade for all commercial loans

within a short timeframe is remote.
Consumer loansThe consumer portfolio is segmented into three main business

lines: Chase Home Finance, Chase Cardmember Services and

Chase Auto Finance. For each major portfolio segment within
each line of business, there are three primary factors that are

considered in determining the expected loss component of the

allowance for loan losses: period-end outstandings, expected loss
factor and average life. The various components of these factors,
such as collateral, prepayment rates, credit score distributions,

collections and the historical loss experience of a business seg-
ment, differ across business lines. For example, credit card revolv-

ing credit has significantly higher charge-off ratios than fixed

mortgage credit. Determination of each factor is based primarily

on statistical data and macroeconomic assumptions.
Residual component ManagementÕs judgments are also applied when considering

uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political

conditions, the impact of currency devaluation on cross-border

exposures, changes in underwriting standards, unexpected cor-

relations within the portfolio or other factors. For example,judgment as to political developments in a particular country
will affect managementÕs assessment of potential loss in the

credits that have exposure to that country. A separate

allowance component, the residual component, is maintained

to cover these uncertainties, at December 31, 2003, in theManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
76J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
commercial portfolio. It is anticipated that the residual compo-
nent will range between 10% and 20% of the total allowance

for credit losses.
Fair value of financial instruments A portion of JPMorgan ChaseÕs assets and liabilities are carried

at fair value, including trading assets and liabilities, AFS securi-
ties and private equity investments. Held-for-sale loans and

mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of fair value

or cost. At December 31, 2003, approximately $346 billion of

the FirmÕs assets were recorded at fair value. 
Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount atwhich the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction

between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The majority of the FirmÕs assets reported at fair value are based

on quoted market prices or on internally developed models that

are based on independently sourced market parameters, including

interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates.
The valuation process takes into consideration factors such as
liquidity and concentration concerns and, for the derivative

portfolio, counterparty credit risk. See the discussion of CVA on

page 59 of this Annual Report. Management applies judgment
in determining the factors used in the valuation process. For

example, there is often limited market data to rely on when

estimating the fair value of a large or aged position. Similarly,

judgment must be applied in estimating prices for less readily

observable external parameters. Finally, other factors such as

model assumptions, market dislocations and unexpected corre-

lations can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimat-

ing these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss

recorded for a particular position. 
Trading and available-for-sale portfolios
Substantially all of the FirmÕs securities held for trading and
investment purposes (ÒlongÓ positions) and securities that the
Firm has sold to other parties but does not own (ÒshortÓ posi-
tions) are valued based on quoted market prices. However, cer-

tain securities are less actively traded and, therefore, are not

always able to be valued based on quoted market prices. The
determination of their fair value requires management judg-

ment, as this determination may require benchmarking to similar

instruments or analyzing default and recovery rates.
As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the majority
of the FirmÕs derivative positions are valued using internally devel-

oped models that use as their basis readily observable market

parameters Ð that is, parameters that are actively quoted and can

be validated to external sources, including industry-pricing services.

Certain derivatives, however, are valued based on models with 

significant unobservable market parameters Ð that is, parameters
that may be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management

judgment to substantiate the model valuation. These instruments
are normally either less actively traded or trade activity is one-way.

Examples include long-dated interest rate or currency swaps,

where swap rates may be unobservable for longer maturities; 

and certain credit products, where correlation and recovery rates

are unobservable.
Management judgment includes recording fair value adjust-
ments (i.e., reductions) to model valuations to account for

parameter uncertainty when valuing complex or less actively
traded derivative transactions. The table below summarizes the FirmÕs trading and AFS portfo-
lios by valuation methodology at December 31, 2003:Trading assetsTrading liabilities

To ensure that the valuations are appropriate, the Firm has vari-
ous controls in place. These include: an independent review and

approval of valuation models; detailed review and explanation

for profit and loss analyzed daily and over time; decomposing

the model valuations for certain structured derivative instru-

ments into their components and benchmarking valuations,
where possible, to similar products; and validating valuation esti-

mates through actual cash settlement. As markets and products

develop and the pricing for certain derivative products becomes
more transparent, the Firm refines its valuation methodologies.
The Valuation Control Group within the Finance area is responsible

for reviewing the accuracy of the valuations of positions taken

within the Investment Bank.For a discussion of market risk management, including themodel review process, see Market Risk Management on pages

66Ð72 of this Annual Report. For further details regarding the

FirmÕs valuation methodologies, see Note 31 on pages 120Ð123

of this Annual Report.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
77Loans held-for-sale
The fair value of loans in the held-for-sale portfolio is generally
based on observable market prices of similar instruments,
including bonds, credit derivatives and loans with similar 

characteristics. If market prices are not available, fair value is

based on the estimated cash flows, adjusted for credit risk that

is discounted using a rate appropriate for each maturity that

incorporates the effects of interest rate changes.
Private equity investments Valuation of private investments held by JPMP requires signifi-
cant management judgment due to the absence of quoted
market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of

such assets. Private investments are initially valued based on

cost. The carrying values of private investments are adjusted

from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evi-

denced by financing events with third-party capital providers. In

addition, these investments are subject to ongoing impairment

reviews by JPMPÕs senior investment professionals. A variety of
factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment

including, but not limited to, operating performance and future

expectations, industry valuations of comparable public compa-
nies, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing

environment over time. The Valuation Control Group within the

Finance area is responsible for reviewing the accuracy of the
carrying values of private investments held by JPMP. For addi-
tional information about private equity investments, see the
Private equity risk management discussion on page 74 and

Note 15 on page 106 of this Annual Report.
MSRs and certain other retained interestsMSRs and certain other retained interests from securitization

activities do not trade in an active, open market with readily

observable prices. For example, sales of MSRs do occur, but the

precise terms and conditions are typically not readily available.

Accordingly, the Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs and cer-

tain other retained interests using a discounted future cash flow

model. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractu-
ally specified servicing fees and prepayment assumptions, delin-

quency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, costs to

service and other economic factors. The Firm compares its fair

value estimates and assumptions to observable market data
where available, to recent market activity and to actual portfolio

experience. Management believes that the fair values and related

assumptions are comparable to those used by other market partici-

pants. For a further discussion of the most significant assumptions
used to value these retained interests, as well as the applicable

stress tests for those assumptions, see Notes 13 and 16 on pages

100Ð103 and 107Ð109, respectively, of this Annual Report.
Nonexchange-traded commodity contracts at fair valueIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase trades 
nonexchange-traded commodity contracts. To determine the 

fair value of these contracts, the Firm uses various fair value 
estimation techniques, which are primarily based on internal

models with significant observable market parameters. The FirmÕs
nonexchange-traded commodity contracts are primarily energy-
related contracts. The following table summarizes the changes infair value for nonexchange-traded commodity contracts for the

Accounting for stock-based compensationEffective January 1, 2003, JPMorgan Chase adopted SFAS 123,
which establishes the accounting for stock-based compensation
and requires that all such transactions, including stock options,

be accounted for at fair value and be recognized in earnings.

Awards outstanding as of December 31, 2002, if not subse-
quently modified, continue to be accounted for under APB 25.
For a further discussion on the adoption of SFAS 123, see Note 7

on pages 93Ð95 of 
this Annual Report.Consolidation of variable interest entities
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46. Entities that would be
assessed for consolidation under FIN 46 are typically referred to

as Special-Purpose Entities (ÒSPEsÓ), although non-SPE-type enti-
ties may also be subject to the guidance. FIN 46 requires a vari-

able interest entity (ÒVIEÓ) to be consolidated by a company if

that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the

variable interest entityÕs activities or entitled to receive a majority

of the entityÕs residual returns, or both. Effective February 1,

2003, the Firm implemented FIN 46 for VIEs created or modified

after January 31, 2003, in which the Firm has an interest.
Effective July 1, 2003, the Firm adopted the provisions of FIN 46
for all VIEs originated prior to February 1, 2003, excluding cer-
tain investments made by JPMP. The FASB provided a specific

deferral for nonregistered investment companies until the pro-

posed Statement of Position on the clarification of the scope of
the Investment Company Audit Guide is finalized, which is
expected to occur in mid-2004. The Firm has deferred consolida-

tion of $2.7 billion of additional assets related to JPMP as of

December 31, 2003. For further details regarding FIN 46, refer

to Note 14 on pages 103Ð106 of 
this Annual Report.In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (ÒFIN
46RÓ) to address various technical corrections and implementa-

tion issues that have arisen since its issuance. The provisions of

FIN 46R are effective for financial periods ending after March 15,

2004, thus the Firm will implement the new provisions effective

March 31, 2004. As FIN 46R was recently issued and contains

provisions that the accounting profession continues to analyze,

the FirmÕs assessment of the impact of FIN 46R on all VIEs with

which it is involved is ongoing. However, at this time and based

on managementÕs current interpretation, the Firm does not

believe that the implementation of FIN 46R will have a material
impact on the FirmÕs Consolidated financial statements, earnings

or capital resources. 
Accounting for certain financial instrumentswith characteristics of both liabilities and equityIn May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, which establishes stan-
dards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement

of financial position certain financial instruments with character-
istics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify
a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or anasset in some circumstances), because that financial instrument

embodies an obligation of the issuer. Initially, SFAS 150 was

effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified

after May 31, 2003, and was otherwise effective beginning July

1, 2003. In November 2003, the FASB deferred the effective

date of the statement with respect to mandatorily redeemable

financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and for cer-

tain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The imple-

mentation of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the

FirmÕs Consolidated financial statements.
Derivative instruments and hedging activitiesIn April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which amends and

clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments, including cer-
tain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS 133. Specifically, SFAS 149 clarifies

the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net

investment meets the characteristics of a derivative, and when a
derivative contains a financing component that warrants special
reporting in the Consolidated statement of cash flows. SFAS
149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified

after June 30, 2003; implementation did not have a material
effect on the FirmÕs Consolidated financial statements in 2003. 
Accounting for costs associated with exit ordisposal activitiesIn June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, which establishes new
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS 146 requires a liability

for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be
recorded when that liability is incurred and can be measured at
fair value. Under the previous rules, if management approved an

exit plan in one quarter, the costs of that plan generally would

have been recorded in the same quarter even if the costs were

not incurred until a later quarter. In contrast, under SFAS 146,

some costs may qualify for immediate recognition, while other

costs may be incurred over one or more quarters. The impact of

SFAS 146 will generally be to spread out the timing of the

recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities.Impairment of available-for-sale and held-to-
maturity securitiesIn November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (ÒEITFÓ)
reached a consensus on certain additional quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements in connection with its 

deliberations of Issue 03-1, the impairment model for available-
for-sale and held-to-maturity securities under SFAS 115. See

Note 9 on page 97 of this Annual Report which sets forth the

disclosures now required. 
Accounting and reporting developments
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
79Goodwill and other intangible assetsEffective January 1, 2002, the Firm adopted SFAS 142 which
establishes the accounting for intangible assets (other than
those acquired in a business combination). It also addresses the

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent
to an acquisition. For a further discussion on the adoption of
SFAS 142, see Note 16 on page 107 of this Annual Report. 
Accounting for certain loans or debt securitiesacquired in a transfer
In December 2003, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 03-3
(ÒSOP 03-3Ó), Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities
Acquired in a Transfer. SOP 03-3 provides guidance on the

accounting for differences between contractual and expected

cash flows from the purchaserÕs initial investment in loans or debt

securities acquired in a transfer, if those differences are attributa-

ble, at least in part, to credit quality. Among other things, SOP

03-3: (1) prohibits the recognition of the excess of contractual

cash flows over expected cash flows as an adjustment of yield,
loss accrual or valuation allowance at the time of purchase; (2)

requires that subsequent increases in expected cash flows be rec-
ognized prospectively through an adjustment of yield; and (3)

requires that subsequent decreases in expected cash flows be rec-
ognized as an impairment. In addition, SOP 03-3 prohibits the

creation or carrying over of a valuation allowance in the initial

accounting of all loans within its scope that are acquired in a

transfer. SOP 03-3 becomes effective for loans or debt securities

acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004.
Accounting for trading derivativesIn October 2002, the EITF concluded on Issue 02Ð3, which,
effective January 1, 2003, precludes mark-to-market accounting

for energy-related contracts that do not meet the definition 

of a derivative under SFAS 133 (i.e., transportation, storage or

capacity contracts). The Firm implemented this provision of Issue

02Ð3 effective January 1, 2003; implementation did not have a

material effect on the FirmÕs Consolidated statement of income.

In November 2002, as part of the discussion of Issue 02Ð3, the
FASB staff further confirmed their view that an entity should not
recognize profit at the inception of a trade involving a derivative
financial instrument in the absence of: (a) quoted market prices
in an active market, (b) observable prices of other current mar-

ket transactions or (c) other observable data supporting a valua-
tion technique. This clarification did not have a material impact
on the FirmÕs Consolidated statements of income in 2002 and

2003. The FASB intends in 2004 to continue to focus on issues

relating to the fair value of financial instruments.Accounting for interest rate lock commitments
(ÒIRLCsÓ)IRLCs associated with mortgages (commitments to extend credit
at specified interest rates) are currently accounted for as deriva-

tive instruments in accordance with SFAS 149. IRLCs are recorded
at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the income

statement.  In October 2003, the FASB added a new project to its agenda to
clarify SFAS 133, with respect to the information that should be

used to determine the fair value of IRLCs that are accounted for

as derivatives, and whether loan commitments should be reported

as assets by the issuer of that commitment (i.e., the lender). In
December 2003, the SEC prescribed guidance that IRLCs were

deemed to be written options from the standpoint of the mort-

gage lender and, as a result, should be recorded as a liability at

inception and remain a liability until the loan is funded. This

guidance will be effective for IRLCs entered into with potential

borrowers after March 31, 2004. This guidance will impact the

timing of revenue recognition related to IRLCs. Further, the

impact of this guidance on the FirmÕs current practice will be

influenced by the volume of new IRLCs, the volume of loan
sales and the changes in market interest rates during the period.

The Firm is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its

results of operations and hedging strategies.ManagementÕs Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting In June 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adoptedfinal rules under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(ÒSection 404Ó). Commencing with its 2004 annual report,

JPMorganChase will be required to include a report of manage-

ment on the FirmÕs internal control over financial reporting. 

The internal control report must include a statement of man-

agementÕs responsibility for establishing and maintaining ade-

quate internal control over financial reporting for the Firm; of

managementÕs assessment of the effectiveness of the FirmÕs

internal control over financial reporting as of year-end; of the

framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness

of the FirmÕs internal control over financial reporting; and that

the FirmÕs independent accounting firm has issued an attesta-

tion report on managementÕs assessment of the FirmÕs internal

control over financial reporting, which report is also required to

be filed as part of the Annual Report. ManagementÕs discussion and analysis
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
80J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
JPMorgan ChaseÕs 2002 net income was $1.7 billion, relatively
flat when compared with the prior year. Net income per diluted

share was $0.80 in 2002, unchanged from 2001.
Total revenues for 2002 of $29.6 billion were up by only 1%
from 2001. The consumer businesses of the Firm contributed to

the higher revenue, benefiting primarily from the gradual reduc-

tion in interest rates in 2002. Mortgage originations at Chase

Home Finance in high-margin sectors like retail, wholesale, tele-

phone-based and e-commerce reached $113 billion, 30%

above the level reached in 2001. This exceptional growth, how-

ever, was partly offset by the sluggishness in the wholesale busi-

nesses, primarily IB, due to the continued slowdown in market
activities, a reflection of the weak economic environment and

diminished investor confidence.From a business-segment point of view, the revenue results
were mixed in 2002. CFS revenue of $13.4 billion grew by 24%

over 2001, reflecting high volumes across all consumer credit

businesses and significant gains in Chase Home Finance from

the hedging of MSRs, partially offset by the negative impact of

lower interest rates on deposits. TSS reported modest revenue

growth, as strong gains in 
Treasury Services and InstitutionalTrust Services, attributable mostly to new businesses,were offset
by a decline in Investor Services, which suffered from the lower

value of assets held under custody. These increases were offset

by declines in the FirmÕs wholesale businesses. In IB, revenue

declined 15%, driven by the reduction in capital markets and

lending revenue, as well as in Investment banking fees. The

reduction in capital markets revenue was primarily attributable
to lower portfolio management revenue related to both fixed

income and equities transactions. IMPBÕs revenue in 2002

declined 11% from 2001, reflecting the depreciation in the

equities market and institutional outflows across all asset classes.

JPMP recognized private equity losses of $733 million in 2002,

compared with losses of $1.2 billion in 2001, as a result of

lower levels of write-downs and write-offs, particularly in the

Technology and Telecommunications sectors.
The FirmÕs total noninterest expense was $22.8 billion in 2002,
down 4% from 2001, with both years incurring several large

charges. In 2002, the costs associated with merger and restruc-

turing initiatives were $1.2 billion, versus $2.5 billion in 2001. 

In addition, in 2002, the Firm recorded a $1.3 billion charge 

in connection with the settlement of its Enron-related surety 

litigation and the establishment of a reserve related to certain

material litigation, proceedings and investigations, as well as a

$98 million charge for unoccupied excess real estate. Excluding

the impact of these charges in both years, the FirmÕs full-year

2002 noninterest expense of $20.2 billion was lower than that

of 2001. Severance and related costs from expense manage-

ment initiatives, approximately 70% of which were in IB, added 

$890 million to noninterest expense for 2002. These charges

were more than offset by the continued focus on expenses,

which kept spending levels low, and by the adoption in 2002 

of SFAS 142, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill.
All business segments reported lower-to-flat noninterest expenses,
except CFS, where higher business volumes resulted in expense

growth. IB and IMPB reduced headcount in response to lower

market activity levels. At TSS, tight expense management in
2002 allowed for investments while keeping expense levels
essentially flat with 2001.The Provision for credit losses increased to $4.3 billion in 2002,
up 36% from the prior year. This was principally attributable to

troubled commercial credits in the Telecommunications and

Cable sectors and the impact of the Providian acquisition in

2002, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer provision,

reflecting the effect of credit card securitizations.
Income tax expense in 2002 was $856 million, compared with
$847 million in 2001. The effective tax rate was 34% in 2002,

versus 33% in 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate was

principally attributable to the level of income earned in certain

state and local tax jurisdictions in 2002.Comparison between 2002 and 2001 ManagementÕs report on responsibility for financial reporting
and Report of independent auditors  J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
To our stockholders:
The management of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has the responsibility
for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements

and for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared

in accordance with accounting principles generally acceptedin the

United States of America. The consolidated financial statements
include amounts that are based on managementÕs best estimates

and judgments. Management also prepared the other information

in the Annual Report and is responsible for its accuracy and con-

sistency with the consolidated financial statements.Management maintains a comprehensive system of internal con-
trol to provide reasonable assurance of the proper authorization

of transactions, the safeguarding of assets and the reliability of

the financial records. The system of internal control provides for

appropriate division of responsibility and is documented by written 

policies and procedures that are communicated to employees. 

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. maintains a strong internal auditing

program that independently assesses the effectiveness of the sys-
tem of internal control 
and recommends possible improvements.
Management believes that at December 31, 2003, J.P. Morgan

Chase & Co. maintained an effective system of internal control.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the
systems of internal control and financial reporting. The Com-

mittee, which is comprised of directors who are independent from

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., meets and consults regularly with man-

agement, the internal auditors and the independent accountants

to review the scope and results of their work.
To the Board of Directors and stockholders of 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes

in stockholdersÕ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all

material respects, the financial position of J.P. Morgan Chase &

Co. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003,

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements are 

the responsibility of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Õs management; 

our r
esponsibility is to express an opinion on these financial state-
ments based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally

accepted in the United States of America, which require that 

we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance

about whether the financial statements are free of material 

misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, PRICEWATERHOUSE

Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
Basis of Presentation
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (ÒJPMorgan ChaseÓ or the ÒFirmÓ) is 
a financial holding company for a group of subsidiaries that 

provide a wide range of services to a global client base that

includes corporations, governments, institutions and individuals.

For a discussion of the FirmÕs business segment information, see

Note 34 on pages 126Ð127 of 
this Annual Report.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (ÒGAAPÓ)
and prevailing industry practices. Additionally, where applicable,

the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines

prescribed by bank regulatory authorities.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include accounts of
JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a 
controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances

and transactions have been eliminated. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is owner-
ship of a majority of the voting interests of an entity. However, 

a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as

special purpose entities (ÒSPEsÓ), through arrangements that do

not involve voting interests.   
SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, providing
market liquidity by facilitating investorsÕ access to specific port-
folios of assets and risks. They are, for example, critical to the

functioning of the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and
commercial paper markets. SPEs may be organized as trusts,

partnerships or corporations and are typically set up for a single,

discrete purpose. SPEs are not operating entities and usually

have no employees and a limited life. The basic SPE structure

involves a company selling assets to the SPE. The SPE funds the
purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The

legal documents that govern the transaction describe how 

the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPEÕs

investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows.
SPEs can be structured to be bankruptcy-remote, thereby insu-

lating investors from the impact of the creditors of other

entities, including the seller of the assets.There are two different accounting frameworks applicable to
SPEs, depending on the nature of the entity and the FirmÕs rela-

tion to that entity; the qualifying SPE (ÒQSPEÓ) framework
under SFAS 140 and the variable interest entity (ÒVIEÓ)

framework under FIN 46. The QSPE framework is applicable
when an entity transfers (sells) financial assets to an SPE meet-
ing certain criteria. These criteria are designed to ensure that the
Note 1activities of the SPE are essentially predetermined in their

entirety at the inception of the vehicle and that the transferor

cannot exercise control over the entity. Entities meeting these

criteria are not consolidated by the transferors. The Firm prima-

rily follows the QSPE model for the securitizations of its
residential and commercial mortgages, credit card loans and
automobile loans. For further details, see Note 13 on pages
100Ð103 of this Annual Report. When the SPE does not meet the QSPE criteria, consolidation isassessed pursuant to FIN 46. A VIE is defined as an entity that:
lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial sup-

port from other parties; has equity owners who are unable to

make decisions, and/or; has equity owners that do not absorb or
receive the entityÕs losses and returns. VIEs encompass vehicles tra-
ditionally viewed as SPEs and may also include other entities or
legal structures, such as certain limited-purpose subsidiaries, trusts

or investment funds. Entities excluded from the scope of FIN 46

include all QSPEs, regardless of whether the Firm was the trans-

feror, as long as the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to

liquidate the vehicle or cause it to no longer meet the QSPE crite-
ria, and other entities that meet certain criteria specified in FIN 46. FIN 46 requires a variable interest holder (counterparty to a VIE)
to consolidate the VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the
expected losses of the VIE, receive a majority of the residual

returns of the VIE, or both. This party is considered the primary
beneficiary of the entity. The determination of whether the Firm

meets the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of a

VIE requires an evaluation of all transactions (such as investments,

liquidity commitments, derivatives and fee arrangements) with
the entity. The foundation for this evaluation is an expected-loss

calculation prescribed by FIN 46. For further details, see Note 14

on pages 103-106 of this Annual Report.Prior to the FirmÕs adoption of FIN 46, the decision of whether or
not to consolidate depended on the applicable accounting princi-
ples for non-QSPEs, including a determination regarding the

nature and amount of investment made by third parties in the

SPE. Consideration was given to, among other factors, whether a
third party had made a substantive equity investment in the SPE;

which party had voting rights, if any; who made decisions about
the assets in the SPE; and who was at risk of loss. The SPE was

consolidated if JPMorgan Chase retained or acquired control over

the risks and rewards of the assets in the SPE.
Financial assets sold to an SPE or a VIE are derecognized when:
(1) the assets are legally isolated from the FirmÕs creditors, (2)

the accounting criteria for a sale are met and (3) the SPE is a

QSPE under SFAS 140, or the SPE can pledge or exchange the

financial assets. All significant transactions and retained interests
86J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
between the Firm, QSPEs and nonconsolidated VIEs are reflected
on JPMorgan ChaseÕs Consolidated balance sheet or in the

Notes to consolidated financial statements. Investments in companies that are considered to be voting-
interest entities under FIN 46, in which the Firm has significant

influence over operating and financing decisions (generally
defined as owning a voting or economic interest of 20% to

50%), are accounted for in accordance with the equity method

of accounting. These investments are generally included in

Other assets, and the FirmÕs share of income or loss is included

in Other revenue. For a discussion of private equity investments,

see Note 15 on page 106 of this Annual Report.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by theFirm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included in

the Consolidated balance sheet.Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to 
conform to the current presentation.
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statementsThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the

reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and dis-
closures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could

be different from these estimates.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are

translated into U.S. dollars using applicable rates of exchange.
JPMorgan Chase translates revenues and expenses using

exchange rates at the transaction date. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in Other

comprehensive income (loss) within StockholdersÕ equity. Gains

and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions,

including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency 

is the U.S. dollar and operations in highly inflationary environ-

ments, are reported in the Consolidated statement of income.
Statement of cash flowsFor JPMorgan ChaseÕs Consolidated statement of cash flows,

cash and cash equivalents are defined as those amounts

included in Cash and due from banks.

Other noninterest revenue 
Investment banking feesInvestment banking fees include advisory and equity and debtunderwriting fees. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue when

related services are performed. Underwriting fees are recognized
as revenue when the Firm has rendered all services to the issuer

and is entitled to collect the fee from the issuer, as long as there

are no other contingencies associated with the fee (e.g., not

contingent on the customer obtaining financing). Underwriting
fees are presented net of syndicate expenses. In addition, the

Firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndication fees as rev-

enue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.

of credit and financial guarantees, compensating balances,

insurance products and other financial serviceÐrelated products.

These fees are recognized over the period in which the related

service is provided. Also included are credit card fees, which pri-
marilyinclude 
interchange income (transaction-processing fees),
late fees, cash advance fees, annual and overlimit fees, and serv-
icing fees earned in connection with securitization activities.

Credit card fees are recognized as billed, except for annual fees,

which are recognized over a 12-month period.

fees from mortgage origination and servicing activities, revenue

generated through loan sales and securitization activities, includ-

ing related hedges, as well as the impact from hedging mortgage

servicing rights with derivatives (both those designated and not
designated under SFAS 133). Mortgage servicing fees are recog-

nized over the period that the related service is provided net of

amortization.The valuation changes of mortgage servicing rights

and the corresponding derivatives are adjusted through earnings

in the same period. Gains and losses on loan sales and securiti-
zations are recognized in income upon sale or securitization. Net

interest income and securities gains and losses related to these

mortgage banking activities are not included in Mortgage fees

and related income.

Note 5Postretirement employee benefit plans
The FirmÕs defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 88. Its postretirement med-

ical and life insurance plans are accounted for in accordance

with SFAS 106.
JPMorgan Chase uses a measurement date of December 31 for
its postretirement employee benefit plans. The fair value of plan

assets is used to determine the expected return on plan assets

for its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For the
U.S. postretirement benefit plan, the market-related value, which

recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period, is usedto determine the expected return on plan assets. Unrecognized

net actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the average

remaining service period of active plan participants, if required.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the ÒActÓ) was signed into law on December 8,
2003. As permitted under FSP SFAS 106-1, JPMorgan Chase

elected to defer accounting for certain of the effects of the Act

pending issuance of final guidance and transition rules. The Firm

is currently reviewing the Act and the potential impact on its U.S.

postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, the accumulated postre-

tirement 
benefit obligation and net periodic benefit costs related
to this plan do not reflect the effects of the Act. Once final guid-

ance is issued, previously reported information is subject to change.
Defined benefit pension plansJPMorgan Chase has a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined
benefit pension plan that provides benefits to substantially 

all U.S. employees. The U.S. plan employs a cash balance for-
mula, in the form of service and interest credits, to determine

the benefits to be provided at retirement, based on eligible

compensation and years of service. Employees begin to accrue
plan benefits after completing one year of service, and benefits
vest after five years of service. The Firm also offers benefits

through defined benefit pension plans to qualifying employees

in certain non-U.S. locations based on eligible compensation
and years of service. It is JPMorgan ChaseÕs policy to fund its pension plans in
amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable

employee benefit and local tax laws. In 2003, the Firm made
two cash contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan:
$127 million on February 10 to fully fund the planÕs projected

benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002, and $200 million
on December 29 to fully fund the planÕs projected benefit obli-

gation as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Firm made

cash contributions totaling $87 million to fund fully the accumu-
lated benefit obligations of certain non-U.S. defined benefit
pension plans as of December 31, 2003. Based on the current

funded status of the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the Firm
does not expect to make significant fundings in 2004. Note 6Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
90J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
While the Firm owns the COLI policies, COLI proceeds (death
benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only
to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim

payments and related administrative expenses. The U.K. postre-

tirement benefit plan is unfunded.
The following tables present the funded status and amounts
reported on the Consolidated balance sheet, the accumulatedbenefit obligation and the components of net periodic benefit
costs reported in the Consolidated statement of income for the

FirmÕs U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretire-

ment benefit plans.Postretirement medical and life insurance
JPMorgan Chase offers postretirement medical and life

insurance benefits to qualifying U.S. employees. These benefits
vary with length of service and date of hire and provide for lim-

its on the FirmÕs share of covered medical benefits. The medical

benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits are

noncontributory. Postretirement medical benefits are also

offered to qualifying U.K. employees. 
JPMorgan ChaseÕs U.S. postretirement benefit obligation is
partially funded with corporate-owned life insurance (ÒCOLIÓ)
purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees.

JPMorgan Chase has a number of other defined benefit pensionplans (i.e., U.S. plans not subject to Title IV of the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act). The most significant of these

plans is the Excess Retirement Plan, pursuant to which certain

employees earn service credits on compensation amounts above

the maximum stipulated by law. This plan is a nonqualified
noncontributory U.S. pension plan with an unfunded liability 
at each of December 31, 2003 and 2002, in the amount of 
$178 million. Compensationexpense related to the FirmÕs other
defined benefit pension plans totaled $19 million in 2003, $15 million in 2002 and $22 million in 2001.Plan assumptions
JPMorgan ChaseÕs expected long-term rate of return for U.S.

defined benefit pension plan assets is a blended average of itsinvestment advisorÕs pr
ojected long-term (10 years or more)
returns for the 
various asset classes, weighted by the portfolioallocation. Asset-class returns are developed using a forward-
looking building-block approach and are not based strictly on
historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the

sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected

long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed
as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as

appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from
changing yields. Other asset-class returns are derived from their
relationship to equity and bond markets. In the United Kingdom, which represents the most significant of
the non-U.S. pension plans, procedures similar to those in the

United States are used to develop the expected long-term rate of

return on pension plan assets, taking into consideration local 
market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. The
expected long-term rate of return on U.K. plan assets is an average

of projected long-term returns for each asset class, selected by ref-

erence to the yield on long-term U.K. government bonds and

AA-rated long-term corporate bonds, plus an equity risk premium

above the risk-free rate. 
The expected long-term rate of return for the U.S. postretirement
medical and life insurance plans is computed using procedures 

similar to those used for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan.The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation underthe U.S. postretirement employee benefit plans is selected by refer-

ence to the year-end MoodyÕs corporate AA rate, as well as other

high-quality indices with similar duration to that of the respective

planÕs benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.K. postretire-

ment plans is selected by reference to the year-end iBoxx £

corporate AA 15-year-plus bond rate.

Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
92J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
At December 31, 2003, the Firm reduced the discount rate used
to determine its U.S. benefit obligations to 6.00%. The Firm also
reduced the 2004 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan
assets to 7.75% and 7.00%, respectively, for its pension and

other postretirement benefit expenses. The impact of the

changes as of December 31, 2003, to the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate is expected to

increase 2004 U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit

expenses by approximately $35 million. The impact of the

changes to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

and the discount rate on non-U.S. pension and other postretire-

ment benefit expenses is not expected to be material.JPMorgan ChaseÕs U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit
expenses are most sensitive to the expected long-term rate of

return on plan assets. With all other assumptions held constant, a
25Ðbasis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return

on U.S. plan assets would result in an increase of approximately

$15 million in 2004 U.S. pension and other postretirement bene-

fit expenses. Additionally, 
a 25Ðbasis point decline in the discountrate for the U.S. plans would result in an increase in 2004 U.S.

pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of approxima-

tely $12 million and an increase in the related benefit obligation

of approximately $143 million. The impact of a declinein the

discount rate related to the U.S. pension plan would be signifi-
cantly offset by the effect of a similar reduction in the assumed

interest rate used for crediting participant balances. 
Investment strategy and asset allocationThe investment policy for postretirement employee benefit plan

assets is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate

to the respective planÕs needs and goals, using a global portfolio

of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic
sector and issuer. Specifically, the goal is to optimize the asset

mix for future benefit obligations, while managing various risk

factors and each planÕs investment return objectives. For exam-

ple, long-duration fixed income securities are included in the

U.S. qualified pension planÕs asset allocation, in recognition of

its long-duration obligations. Plan assets are managed by a com-

bination of internal and external investment managers and, on a

quarterly basis, are rebalanced to target, to the extent economi-

cally practical. The FirmÕs U.S. pension plan assets are held in various trusts and
are invested in well diversified portfolios of equity (including

U.S. large and small capitalization and international equities),

fixed income (including corporate and government bonds),

Treasury inflation-indexed and high-yield securities, cash equiva-lents and other securities. Non-U.S. pension plan assets are

similarly invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed

income and other securities. Assets of the FirmÕs COLI policies,

which are used to fund partially the U.S. postretirement benefit

plan, are held in separate accounts with an insurance company

and are invested in equity and fixed income index funds. Assets

used to fund the FirmÕs U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pen-

sion and postretirement benefit plans do not include JPMorgan

Chase common stock, except in connection with investments in
third-party stock-index funds.

Defined contribution plansJPMorgan Chase offers several defined contribution plans in 
the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of
these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan, covering
substantially all U.S. employees. This plan allows employees to
make pre-tax contributions to tax-deferred investment

portfolios. For most employees, the Firm matches employee
contributions dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of eligi-

ble compensation per pay period, subject to plan and legal
limits. Employees begin to receive matching contributions after

completing one year of service; benefits vest after three years of

service. The FirmÕs defined contribution plans are administered in

accordance with applicable local laws and regulations.

Compensation expense related to these plans totaled $240 mil-

lion in 2003, $251 million in 2002 and $208 million in 2001.Employee stock-based incentivesEffective January 1, 2003, JPMorgan Chase adopted SFAS 123

using the prospective transition method. SFAS 123 requires all

stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, to

be accounted for at fair value. Fair value is based on a Black-
Scholes valuation model, with compensation expense
recognized in earnings over the required service period. Under
Note 7the prospective transition method, all new awards granted to
employees on or after January 1, 2003, are accounted for under

SFAS 123. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123, the

Firm decided to provide key employees, excluding members of

the Executive Committee, with the ability to elect to receive the

value of their stock-based compensation awards as stock

options, restricted stock or any combination thereof. The net

effect was to reduce net income by $0.08 per share in 2003.

Awards that were outstanding as of December 31, 2002, if not
subsequently modified, continue to be accounted for under 
APB 25. Through December 31, 2002, JPMorgan Chase

accounted for its employee stock-based compensation plans
under the intrinsic-value method in accordance with APB 25.

Under this method, no expense is recognized for stock options

granted at the stock price on the grant date, since such options
have no intrinsic value. Compensation expense for restricted

stock and restricted stock units (ÒRSUsÓ) is measured based on

the number of shares granted and the stock price at the grant

date and is recognized over the required service period. 
Key employee stock-based awards
JPMorgan Chase grants long-term stock-based incentive awards

to certain key employees under two plans (the ÒLTI PlansÓ). The

Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders in May

2000, provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation

rights (ÒSARsÓ), restricted stock and RSU awards, and the Stock

Option Plan, a nonshareholder-approved plan, provides for

grants of stock options and SARs. Through December 31, 2003,

SARs have not been granted under either of these plans.Under the LTI Plans, stock options are granted with an exercise
price equal to JPMorgan ChaseÕs common stock price on the

grant date. Generally, options cannot be exercised until at least

one year after the grant date and become exercisable over vari-

ous periods as determined at the time of the grant. Options
generally expire 10 years after the grant date. In January 2001,

JPMorgan Chase granted 82.2 million options under the LTI

Plans, pursuant to a growth performance incentive program

(ÒGPIPÓ). Forfeitures of GPIP options aggregated 23.7 million

shares through December 31, 2003.

Restricted stock and RSUs are granted by JPMorgan Chase
under the LTI Plans at no cost to the recipient. Restricted stock/

RSUs are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have

lapsed, including continued employment for a specified period.
The recipient of a share of restricted stock is entitled to voting

rights and dividends on the common stock. An RSU entitles the
recipient to receive a share of common stock after the applicable
restrictions lapse; the recipient is entitled to receive cash payments
equivalent to dividends on the underlying common stock during
the period the RSU is outstanding.During 2003, 43.5 million restricted stock/RSU awards were
granted by JPMorgan Chase under the LTI Plans. In 2002 and

2001, 24.0 million and 25.9 million awards, respectively, were

granted under these plans. All these awards are payable solely

in stock. The 2001 grants included 1.3 million restricted stock/

RSU awards that are forfeitable if certain target prices are not

achieved. The vesting of these awards is conditioned upon cer-

tain service requirements being met and JPMorgan ChaseÕs

common stock price reaching and sustaining target prices

within a five-year performance period. During 2002, it was
determined that it was no longer probable that the target stock

prices related to forfeitable awards granted in 1999, 2000 and

2001 would be achieved within their respective performance

periods, and accordingly, previously accrued expenses were
reversed. The target stock prices for these awards ranged from
$73.33 to $85.00. These awards will be forfeited in 2004
through 2006 if the target stock prices are not achieved.
A portion of certain employeesÕ cash incentive compensationthat exceeded specified levels was awarded in restricted stock/

RSU awards or other deferred investments (the Òrequired defer-

ral planÓ) issued under the LTI Plans. These restricted stock/RSU

and other deferred awards vest based solely on continued employ-

ment.During 2001, 137,500 of such restricted stock/units were
granted. The required deferral plan was discontinued in 2002.
Broad-based employee stock options
In January 2003, JPMorgan Chase granted 12.8 million

options to 
all eligible full-time (150 options each) and part-time(75 options each) employees under the Value Sharing Plan, a

nonshareholder-approved plan. The exercise price is equal to

JPMorgan ChaseÕs common stock price on the grant date. The

options become exercisable over various periods and generally

expire 10 years after the grant date.

Merger and restructuring costs associated with various programs
announced prior to January 1, 2002, were reflected in the Merger

and restructuring costs caption of the Consolidated statement

of income and had been incurred as of December 31, 2002.

Additionally, all previously recorded liabilities for merger charges

had been fully utilized as of year-end 2002: $1.25 billion in con-

nection with the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase, and $300

million in connection with the right-sizing of employee levels
beyond that planned at the time of the merger.

January 1, 2002, are reflected in the related expense category of
Note 8Comparison of the fair and intrinsic value measurement methods
Pre-tax employee stock-based compensation expense related to
these plans totaled $919 million in 2003 (which includes the 
$266million impact of adopting SF
AS 123), $590 million in 2002 and $798 million in 2001. Compensation expense for 2002
included the reversal of previously accrued expense of $120 mil-

lion related to forfeitable key employee awards granted in 1999,

2000 and 2001, as discussed above. The following table presents net income and basic and diluted
earnings per share as reported, and as if all outstanding awards

were accounted for at fair value. The lower expense from applying

SFAS 123 in 2003 compared with 2002 resulted from a decrease

in the number of outstanding stock-based compensation awards,

a lower common stock price, lower Black-Scholes option fair
values and longer vesting periods. The increase in compensation
expense after applying SFAS 123 in 2002 compared with 2001

reflects a higher level of options granted in prior years that were
not fully vested. This increase is partially offset by a decline in

the weighted-average grant-date fair 
value of options grantedin 2002. Year ended December 31,(in millions,except per share data)

SecuritiesSecurities are classified as Available-for-sale (ÒAFSÓ), Held-to-
maturity (ÒHTMÓ) or Trading. Trading securities are discussed in

Note 3 on pages 87Ð88. Securities are classified as AFS when, in

managementÕs judgment, they may be sold in response to or in

anticipation of changes in market conditions. AFS securities are

carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet.
Unrealized gains and losses after SFAS133 valuation adjustments

are reported as net increases or decreases to Accumulated other

comprehensive income (loss). Impairment is evaluated consider-

ing numerous factors, and their relative significance varies from

case to case. Factors considered in the analysis include the

length of time and extent to which the market value has been
less than cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects

of the issuer; and the intent and ability to retain the security in
order to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. If,

based on the analysis, it is determined that the impairment is
other-than-temporary, the security is written down and a loss is

recognized. The specific identification method is used to deter-mine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are

included in Securities gains (losses) on the Consolidated statement
of income. Securities that the Firm has the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM and are carried

at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheet.The following table presents realized gains and losses from AFS

the effect of related derivatives on AFS securities and the amortization of 
premiums and accretion of discounts) by total amortized cost.Taxable-equivalent yields are used where applicable.
(b)Includes securities with no stated maturity.Substantially all of JPMorgan ChaseÕs MBSs and CMOs are due in 10 years or more 
based on contractual maturity.The estimated duration,which reflects 
anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market,is approximately five years for MBSs and CMOs.
Included in the $799 million of unrealized losses on available-
for-sale securities at December 31, 2003 is $46 million of

unrealized losses that have existed for a period greater than

12 months. These losses primarily relate to $1.5 billion of asset-

backed securities held by commercial paper conduits that were

consolidated by the Firm in accordance with FIN 46 on July 1,

2003. The securities held by the conduits are of high credit

quality, predominantly rated AA or better. Upon adoption of FIN

46, the securities were measured at the amounts at which such

interests would have been carried had the Firm consolidated the

conduits when it first met the conditions to be considered the

primary beneficiary; this resulted in an initial transition adjust-

ment to Other comprehensive income as described in Note 14

on page 106. The overall depreciation in fair value is attributable
to the illiquid secondary market for these securities and is con-sidered temporary, as the Firm has the intent and ability to hold

these investments with the expectation that the unrealized mar-

ket value loss will be recovered.
In calculating the effective yield for mortgage-backed securities
(ÒMBSÓ) and collateralized mortgage obligations (ÒCMOÓ),
JPMorgan Chase actively monitors the likelihood of principal
prepayment through its portfolio management function.

Management regularly performs simulation testing to determine

the impact that market conditions would have on its MBS and
CMO portfolios. MBSs and CMOs that management believes
have high prepayment risk are included in the AFS portfolio

and are reported at fair value.

Securities financing activitiesJPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase
agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities

loaned transactions primarily to finance the FirmÕs inventory

positions, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle

other securities obligations. The Firm also enters into these
transactions to accommodate customersÕ needs.Securities purchased under resale agreements (Òresale
agreementsÓ) and securities sold under repurchase agreements

(Òrepurchase agreementsÓ) are generally treated as collateralized

financing transactions and are carried on the Consolidated bal-

ance sheet at the amounts the securities will be subsequently
sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Where appropriate,

resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty
are reported on a net basis in accordance with FIN 41.

JPMorgan Chase takes possession of securities purchased under

resale agreements. On a daily basis, JPMorgan Chase monitors
the market value of the underlying collateral received from its

counterparties, consisting primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. govern-

ment and agency securities, and requests additional collateral

from its counterparties when necessary.
Similar transactions that do not meet the SFAS 140 definition 
of a repurchase agreement are accounted for as ÒbuysÓ and

ÒsellsÓ rather than financing transactions. These transactions are

accounted for as a purchase (sale) of the underlying securities

with a forward obligation to sell (purchase) the securities. The

forward purchase (sale) obligation, a derivative, is recorded on

the Consolidated balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in
fair value recorded in Trading revenue. Notional amounts of

these transactions accounted for as purchases under SFAS 140

were $15 billion and $8 billion at December 31, 2003 and

2002, respectively. Notional amounts of these transactions

accounted for as sales under SFAS 140 were $8 billion and 

$13 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Based

on the short-term duration of these contracts, the unrealized

gain or loss is insignificant. Securities borrowed and securities lent are recorded at the
amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities bor-

rowed consist primarily of government and equity securities.
JPMorgan Chase monitors the market value of the securities
borrowed and lent on a daily basis and calls for additional col-

lateral when appropriate. Fees received or paid are recorded in

Interest income or Interest expense.

ings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the

secured party are identified as financial instruments owned

(pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, the Firm had received securities as col-
lateral that can be repledged, delivered or otherwise used with a

fair value of approximately $210 billion. This collateral was gen-

erally obtained under resale or securities-borrowing agreements.

Of these securities, approximately $197 billion was repledged,

delivered or otherwise used, generally as collateral under repur-

chase agreements, securities-lending agreements or to cover

short sales.Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
LoansLoans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of

the allowance for loan losses, unearned income and any net

deferred loan fees. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower

of aggregate cost or fair value. Loans are classified as ÒtradingÓ

for secondary market trading activities where positions are

bought and sold to make profits from short-term movements

in price. Loans held for trading purposes are included in Trading
assets and are carried at fair value, with the gains and losses

included in Trading revenue. Interest income is recognized using

the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of

return over the term of the loan.
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest 
is discontinued. Loans (other than certain consumer loans 
discussed below) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately 

if, in the opinion of management, full payment of principal or
interest is in doubt, or when principal or interest is 90 days or

more past due and collateral, if any, is insufficient to cover prin-

cipal and interest. Interest accrued but not collected at the date

a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against Interest

income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees

is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized

only to the extent it is received in cash. However, where there 

is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of loan principal, 

all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying

value of the loan. Loans are restored to accrual status only when

interest and principal payments are brought current and future

payments are reasonably assured.
Consumer loans are generally charged to the Allowance for loan
losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accor-

dance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council

(ÒFFIECÓ) policy. For example, credit card loans are charged off

at the earlier of 180 days past due or within 60 days from

receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy. Residential
mortgage products are generally charged off to net realizable

value at 180 days past due. Other consumer products are gener-

ally charged off (to net realizable value if collateralized) at 120

days past due. Accrued interest on residential mortgage products,

automobile financings and certain other consumer loans are

accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy 
Note 11discussed above. Accrued interest on all other loans is generally
reversed against interest income when the consumer loan is
charged off.
A collateralized loan is considered an in-substance foreclosure
and is reclassified to assets acquired in loan satisfactions, within
Other assets, only when JPMorgan Chase has taken physicalpossession of the collateral. This is regardless of whether formal

foreclosure proceedings have taken place.

JPMorgan Chase accounts for and discloses nonaccrual commer-cial loans as impaired loans and recognizes their interest income

as discussed previously for nonaccrual loans. The Firm excludes

from impaired loans its small-balance, homogeneous consumer

loans; loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair
value; debt securities; and leases. The table below sets forth information about JPMorgan ChaseÕs
impaired loans. The Firm primarily uses the discounted cash flow

Loan securitizationsJPMorgan Chase securitizes, sells and services various consumerloans originated by Chase Financial Services (residential

mortgage, credit card and automobile loans), as well as certain

commercial loans (primarily real estate) originated by the

Investment Bank. Interests in the sold and securitized loans may

be retained as described below.
JPMorgan Chase records a loan securitization as a sale when
the transferred loans are legally isolated 
from the FirmÕs creditors
and the accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses

recorded on loan securitizations depend, in part, on the carrying
amount of the loans sold and are allocated between the loans

sold and the retained interests, based on their relative fair values

at the date of sale. Since quoted market prices are generally not

Allowance for credit losses
JPMorgan ChaseÕs Allowance for loan losses is intended to cover
probable credit losses for which either the asset is not specifically

identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.
Within the allowance, there are specific and expected loss com-
ponents and a residual component. 
The specific loss component covers those commercial loans
deemed by the Firm to be criticized. The Firm internally catego-

rizes its criticized commercial loans into three groups: doubtful,

substandard and special-mention. 
Criticized nonperforming commercial loans (excluding leases) are
considered to be impaired loans. The allowance for impaired

loans is computed using the methodology under SFAS 114. An

allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or col-
lateral value or observable market price) of an impaired loan are

lower than the carrying value of that loan. To compute the spe-

cific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are

evaluated individually, and smaller impaired loans are evaluated

as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective class

of assets. Criticized but performing loans also are evaluated as a

pool, using historical loss rates. The expected loss component covers performing commercial
loans (except criticized loans) and consumer loans. Expected
losses are the product of default probability and loss severity.

These factors are differentiated by risk rating and maturity for

commercial loans. The expected loss estimates for each

consumer loan portfolio are based primarily on the FirmÕs histori-

cal loss experience for the applicable product portfolio. 
Finally, a residual component is maintained to cover uncertain-
ties that could affect managementÕs estimate of probable losses.

The residual component of the allowance reflects the margin of

imprecision in the underlying assumptions used for estimating

specific losses and expected losses. It is anticipated that the
residual component of the allowance will range between 10%and 20% of the total Allowance for loan losses. JPMorgan ChaseÕs Risk Management Committee reviews, at least
quarterly, the Allowance for credit losses relative to the risk pro-

file of the FirmÕs credit portfolio and current economic conditions.

The allowance is adjusted based on that review if, in manage-

mentÕs judgment, changes are warranted. As of December 31,
2003, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance to be appropriate

(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio

but not yet identifiable).To provide for the risk of loss inherent in the credit extension
process, management also computes specific and expected loss

components, as well as a residual component, for lending-

related commitments using a methodology similar to that usedfor the loan portfolio.Note 12J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
101available, the Firm usually estimates fair value of these retained
interests by determining the present value of future expected cash

flows using modeling techniques. Such models incorporate man-
agementÕs best estimates of key variables, such as expected credit

losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates appropriate for the

risks involved. Gains on securitizations are reported in Other rev-

enue. Retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk, such

that JPMorgan Chase may not recover substantially all of its invest-

ment, are recorded at fair value, with subsequent adjustments

reflected in Other comprehensive income or in earnings, if the fair
value of the retained interest has declined below its carrying amount

and such decline has been determined to be other-than-temporary. 
JPMorgan ChaseÐsponsored securitizations utilize SPEs as part of
the securitization process. These SPEs are structured to meet the

definition of a QSPE (as discussed in Note 1); accordingly, the

assets and liabilities of securitization-related SPEs are not reflected

in the FirmÕs Consolidated balance sheet (except for retained inter-

ests as described below) but are included on the balance sheet of

the SPE purchasing the assets. Assets held by securitization-related

SPEs as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, were as follows:
December 31,(in billions)
20032002Credit card receivables

21.120.6Commercial loans33.825.2Automobile loans6.54.5Other receivables
Ñ0.1Total$104.0$90.6Interests in the securitized loans are generally retained by the
Firm in the form of senior or subordinated interest-only strips,

subordinated tranches, escrow accounts and servicing rights,

and they are primarily recorded in Other assets. In addition,

credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a

minimum undivided interest in the trusts, representing the

FirmÕs interests in the receivables transferred to the trust that

have not been securitized. These interests are not represented

by security certificates. The FirmÕs undivided interests are car-

ried at historical cost and are classified in Loans.
JPMorgan Chase retains servicing responsibilities for all 
residential mortgage, credit card and automobile loan securi-
tizations and for certain commercial loan securitizations it

establishes. The Firm receives annual servicing fees based on

the securitized loan balance plus certain ancillary fees. It also
retains the right to service the residential mortgage loans it
sells in connection with mortgage-backed securities transac-
tions with the Government National Mortgage Association

(ÒGNMAÓ), Federal National Mortgage Association (ÒFNMAÓ)
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (ÒFreddie

MacÓ). For a discussion of mortgage servicing rights, see

In addition, the Firm sold residential mortgage loans totaling
$123 billion and $62.2 billion during 2003 and 2002,
respectively, primarily as GNMA, FNMA and Freddie Mac 
mortgage-backed securities; these sales resulted in gains of

$564 million in 2003 and $388 million in 2002. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Firm had, with respect to
its credit card master trusts, $7.3 billion related to its undivided

interest, and $1.1 billion and $978 million, respectively, related

to its subordinated interest in accrued interest and fees on the

securitized receivables.
The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined
limits for some of its credit card and automobile securitizations,

in the unlikely event of deficiencies in cash flows owed to
investors. The amounts available in such escrow accounts are

recorded in Other assets and, as of December 31, 2003,
amounted to $456 million and $137 million for credit card and

automobile securitizations, respectively; as of December 31, 
2002,these amounts were $510 million and $94 million for credit card and
automobile securitizations, respectively.

The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical.
Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in
assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because

the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change

in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that

a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality,

changes in one factor may result in changes in another assump-

tion, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. Expected static-pool net credit losses include actual incurred
losses plus projected net credit losses, divided by the original

balance of the outstandings comprising the securitization pool.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report

Variable interest entities 
JPMorgan ChaseÕs business segments are involved with VIEs in
the following manner: ¥ Investment Bank Ð Utilizes VIEs, such as multi-seller conduits, toassist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient

manner, by providing clients the structural flexibility to meet the

needs of investors relating to factors such as price, yield and

desired risks. The Firm also acts as a financial intermediary to

tailor products for investors. Finally, the IB securitizes commer-

cial mortgages through QSPEs, which are not considered VIEs,

to create commercial mortgage-backed securities, as further 

discussed in Note 13 on pages 100-103 of this Annual Report.¥ Treasury & Securities Services Ð Provides trustee and custodial
services to a number of VIEs. These services are similar to those

provided to non-VIEs. TSS earns market-based fees for services

provided. Such relationships are not considered significant

interests under FIN 46 for disclosure purposes. 
Note 14¥ Investment Management & Private Banking Ð Provides invest-
ment management services to a limited number of the FirmÕs

mutual funds deemed VIEs. The services provided are similar

to the services provided to non-VIEs, as asset manager to the

FirmÕs mutual funds. IMPB earns a fixed fee based on assets

managed; such fee varies with each fundÕs investment objec-

tive and is industry-competitive. The majority of the residual

returns and expected losses are for the account of the fundsÕ
investors. The Firm generally does not hold an equity interest

in the funds, although in certain instances, it may hold a 
nominal interest. For the limited number of funds that qualify

as VIEs, the FirmÕs interest is not considered significant under

FIN 46 for disclosure purposes.  
¥ JPMorgan Partners Ð JPMP, the FirmÕs private equity business, 
is involved with entities that may be deemed VIEs. JPMP
accounts for its activities in accordance with the Investment

Company Audit Guide (ÒAudit GuideÓ). The FASB deferred

adoption of FIN 46 for non-registered investment companies

that apply the Audit Guide. See the FIN 46 Transition section

of this Note.¥ Chase Financial Services Ð Primarily utilizes SPEs to securitize
consumer assets; these entities meet the QSPE criteria as dis-
cussed in Note 1 on pages 86Ð87 and Note 13 on pages
100Ð103 of this Annual Report, and they are not considered

VIEs. CFS is primarily involved with VIEs as part of its middle
market business. This involvement includes: (1) synthetic lease
transactions, in which the Firm provides financing to a VIE; 

in turn, the VIE purchases assets, which are then leased by 

the VIE to the FirmÕs customer; and (2) structuring and admin-

istering independent, member-owned finance entities for

companies with dedicated distribution systems, where the

Firm may also provide some liquidity, letters of credit and/or

derivative instruments. Chase Middle Market earns market-

based fees for providing such services. The VIEs that the Firm

either has an investment in or lends to neither meet the
requirements for consolidation nor are considered significant
for disclosure purposes, since the significant first-loss position

is held by third parties.
As noted above, there are two broad categories of transactions
involving VIEs with which the IB is involved: multi-seller conduits
and client intermediation. These are discussed more fully below.
Multi-seller conduitsJPMorgan Chase serves as the administrator, and provides con-

tingent liquidity support and limited credit enhancement, for

several commercial paper conduits. These conduits give clients

access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing

them to sell assets to the conduit, which then issues commercial

paper to investors to fund the purchases. The Firm does not sell

assets to or service the assets held by these commercial paper
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
104J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
conduits. Commercial paper issued by conduits for which the Firm
acts as administrator aggregated $11.7 billion at December 31,

2003, and $17.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The commercial

paper issued is backed by sufficient collateral, credit enhance-

ments and commitments to provide liquidity to support receiving

at least an A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, an F1 rating.The Firm had commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-
specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to $18.0 billion
at December 31, 2003, and $23.5 billion at December 31,
2002. Third-party banks had commitments to provide liquidity

on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to
$700 million at December 31, 2003, and up to $900 million 
at December 31, 2002. Asset-specific liquidity is the primary
source of liquidity support for the conduits. In addition,

program-wide liquidity is provided by JPMorgan Chase to these

vehicles in the event of short-term disruptions in the commer-
cial paper market; these commitments totaled $2.6 billion and
$2.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For

certain multi-seller conduits, JPMorgan Chase also provides lim-

ited credit enhancement, primarily through the issuance of

letters of credit. Commitments under these letters of credit

totaled $1.9 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and

2002, respectively. 
JPMorgan Chase applies the sameunderwriting standards in making liquidity commitments to

conduits as the Firm would with other extensions of credit.
If JPMorgan Chase were downgraded below A-1, P-1 and, in
certain cases, F1, the Firm could also be required to provide

funding under these liquidity commitments, since commercial

paper rated below A-1, P-1 or F1 would generally not be
issuable by the vehicle. Under these circumstances, the Firm

could either replace itself as liquidity provider or facilitate the

sale or refinancing of the assets held in the VIE in other

markets. JPMorgan ChaseÕs maximum credit exposure to these vehicles 
at December 31, 2003, is $18.7 billion, as the Firm cannot be
obligated to fund the entire notional amounts of asset-specific

liquidity, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement facili-

ties at the same time. However, the Firm views its credit

exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited. This is

because, for the most part, the Firm is not required to fund

under the liquidity facilities if the assets in the VIE are in default.

Additionally, the FirmÕs obligations under the letters of credit are

secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the client or other

third parties Ð for example, by the overcollateralization of the

VIE with the assets sold to it.JPMorgan Chase consolidated these asset-backed commercial
paper conduits at July 1, 2003, in accordance with FIN 46

and recorded the assets and liabilities of the conduits on its

Consolidated balance sheet. In December 2003, one of the
multi-seller conduits was restructured with the issuance of

preferred securities acquired by an independent third-party

investor, who will absorb the majority of the expected losses
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
of the conduit. In deter
mining the primary beneficiary of theconduit, the Firm leveraged an existing rating agency model
that is an independent market standard to size the expected

losses and considered the relative rights and obligations of each

of the variable interest holders. As a result of the restructuring,

JPMorgan Chase deconsolidated approximately $5.4 billion of

the vehicleÕs assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2003.
The remaining conduits continue to be consolidated on the 
FirmÕs balance sheet at December 31, 2003: $4.8 billion of 

assets recorded in Loans, and $1.5 billion of assets recorded in

Available-for-sale securities. 
Client intermediationAs a financial intermediary, the Firm is involved in structuring 
VIE transactions to meet investor and client needs. The Firm inter-
mediates various types of risks (including, for example, fixed
income, equity and credit), typically using derivative instruments.

In certain circumstances, the Firm also provides liquidity and

other support to the VIEs to facilitate the transaction. The FirmÕs

current exposure to nonconsolidated VIEs is reflected in its

Consolidated balance sheet or in the Notes to consolidated 
financial statements. The risks inherent in derivative instruments

or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit,

market and liquidity risks to which the Firm is exposed. Assets held by certain client intermediationÐrelated VIEs at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, were as follows: 
December 31,(in billions)
20032002Structured commercial loan vehicles$5.3$7.2Credit-linked note vehicles
17.79.2Municipal bond vehicles5.55.0Other client intermediation vehicles5.87.4The Firm has created structured commercial loan vehicles
managed by third parties, in which loans are purchased from

third parties or through the FirmÕs syndication and trading func-

tions and funded by issuing commercial paper. Investors provide

collateral and have a first risk of loss up to the amount of collat-
eral pledged. The Firm retains a second-risk-of-loss position for

these vehicles and does not absorb a majority of the expected
losses of the vehicles. Documentation includes provisions intended,

subject to certain conditions, to enable JPMorgan Chase to termi-
nate the transactions related to a particular loan vehicle if the

value of the relevant portfolio declines below a specified level.

The amount of the commercial paper issued by these vehicles

totaled $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2003, and $7.2 billion as
of December 31, 2002. JPMorgan Chase was committed to pro-

vide liquidity to these VIEs of up to $8.0 billion at December 31,
2003, and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2002. The FirmÕs maxi-

mum exposure to loss to these vehicles at December 31, 2003,

was $5.5 billion, which reflects the netting of collateral and other

program limits.
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
105The Firm structures credit-linked notes in which the VIE
purchases highly-rated assets (such as asset-backed securities)

and enters into a credit derivative contract with the Firm to

obtain exposure to a referenced credit not held by the VIE.

Credit-linked notes are issued by the VIE to transfer the risk of

the referenced credit to the investors in the VIE. Clients and

investors often prefer a VIE structure, since the credit-linked

notes generally carry a higher credit rating than they would if

issued directly by JPMorgan Chase. The FirmÕs derivative contract

is not considered a significant variable interest in the VIE,

because it does not absorb risk but rather adds risk to the 
vehicle, which is ultimately absorbed by the investors. The fair
value of the FirmÕs derivative contracts with credit-linked notes

vehicles was not material at December 31, 2003. Assets of 
$2.1 billion and $1.3 billion reported in the table above were

recorded on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, due to other

contractual relationships held by the Firm that relate to the col-

lateral held by the VIE. The Firm is involved with municipal bond vehicles for the pur-pose of creating a series of secondary market trusts that allow

tax-exempt investors to finance their investments at short-term
tax-exempt rates. The VIE purchases fixed-rate, longer-term

highly rated municipal bonds by issuing puttable floating-rate
certificates and inverse floating-rate certificates; the investors in
the inverse floating-rate certificates are exposed to the residual

losses of the VIE (the Òresidual interestsÓ). The Firm often serves

as remarketing agent for the VIE and provides liquidity to support

the remarketing; total liquidity commitments were $1.8 billion

and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In circumstances where the Firm owns the residual interests, the

Firm consolidates the VIE; total amounts consolidated were 

$2.5 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, which are reported in the table above. In circum-
stances where third party investors own the residual interests,

the Firm's exposure is limited because of the high credit quality

of the underlying municipal bonds, the market-value triggers
based on the value of the underlying collateral and the residual

interests held by third parties. The Firm's maximum credit 

exposure to all municipal bond vehicles was $4.3 billion at

December 31, 2003.Additionally, JPMorgan Chase structures, on behalf of clients,
other client intermediation vehicles in which the Firm transfers
the risks and returns of the assets held by the VIE, typically debt

and equity instruments, to clients through derivative contracts.

The FirmÕs net exposure arising from these intermediation trans-

actions is not significant. The FirmÕs current exposure to all of

these vehicles is reflected in its Consolidated financial

statements, as the fair value of the derivative contracts are

recorded in Trading assets or Trading liabilities, and changes in
fair value are recognized in Trading revenue.
Finally, the Firm may enter into transactions with VIEs structured
by other parties. These transactions can include, for example, act-

ing as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,

underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These trans-

actions are conducted at armÕs length, and individual credit

decisions are based upon the analysis of the specific VIE, taking

into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. JPMorgan
Chase records and reports these positions similarly to any other

third-party transaction. For example, derivative contracts are

recorded at fair value and reported in Note 31 on pages 120Ð123
of this Annual Report, whereas liquidity facilities are included

within the FirmÕs lending-related commitments, described in more

detail in Note 29 on pages 117Ð119 of this Annual Report. Fees
received when the Firm operates in an administrative capacity,
such as underwriter, trustee or custodian, are recorded in Fees

and commissions. These activities do not cause JPMorgan Chase
to absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIEs or receive

a majority of the residual returns of the VIE, and they are not con-

sidered significant for disclosure purposes.
FIN 46 Transition 
Effective February 1, 2003, JPMorgan Chase implemented FIN 46

for VIEs created or modified after January 31, 2003, in which the

Firm has an interest. Effective July 1, 2003, the Firm implemented

FIN 46 for all VIEs originated prior to February 1, 2003, excluding
certain investments made by its private equity business, as
discussed below. The effect of adoption was an incremental

increase in the FirmÕs assets and liabilities of approximately $17

billion at July 1, 2003, and $10 billion at December 31, 2003.
The increase primarily related to Firm-sponsored multi-seller 

asset-backed commercial paper conduits and other entities in

which the FirmÕs trading and investment functions have interests

that absorb a majority of the expected losses in the structures. 

In addition, certain VIEs with assets of approximately $2 billion 

at December 31, 2003 that had been consolidatedunder prioraccounting literature continue to be consolidated in accordance

with FIN 46. As a result of its adoption of FIN 46, the Firm also

deconsolidated certain vehicles, primarily the wholly-owned
Delaware statutory business trusts further discussed in Note 18

on pages 110Ð111 of this Annual Report.
The FirmÕs private equity business is involved with entities that
may be deemed VIEs. The FASB permitted nonregistered invest-

ment companies to defer consolidation of VIEs with which they
are involved until the proposed Statement of Position on the clar-

ification of the scope of the Investment Company Audit Guide is
finalized, which is expected in mid-2004. Following issuance of
the Statement of Position, the FASB will consider further modifi-

cation to FIN 46 to provide an exception for companies that

qualify to apply the revised Audit Guide. The Firm applied this

deferral provision and did not consolidate $2.7 billion of
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
106J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
additional assets in potential VIEs with which JPMP is involved asof December 31, 2003. Following issuance of the revised Audit

Guide and further modification, if any, to FIN 46, the Firm will

assess the effect of such guidance on its private equity business.
Upon adoption of FIN 46, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling
interests of VIEs were generally measured at the amounts at

which such interests would have been carried had FIN 46 been

effective when the Firm first met the conditions to be considered

the primary beneficiary. For certain VIEs, the initial carrying

amount of the assets and liabilities (approximately $1.7 billion)

was based on fair value at July 1, 2003, due to limited historical
information. The difference between the net amount added to

the balance sheet and the amount of any previously recognized

interest in the newly consolidated entity was recognized as a

cumulative effect of an accounting change at July 1, 2003, which

resulted in a $2 million (after-tax) reduction to the FirmÕs consoli-
dated earnings. The Firm also recorded a $34 million (after-tax)

reduction in Other comprehensive income, related to Available-
for-sale securities and derivative cash flow hedges; these were

related to entities measured at the amount at which such
interests would have been carried had FIN 46 been effective when

the Firm first met the conditions of being the primary beneficiary.

this Annual Report and is not included herein.
(b) Primarily relates to the consolidated multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduits.

(c) Includes securities and derivatives.
In the third quarter of 2003, the Firm classified the interest-bearing
beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs in a new

line item titled ÒBeneficial interests issued by consolidated variable

interest entities.Ó The holders of these beneficial interests do not

have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note

18 on page 110 of this Annual Report for the maturity profile of

the FIN 46 long-term beneficial interests. 
In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (ÒFIN
46RÓ) to address various technical corrections and implementa-

tion issues that have arisen since the issuance of FIN 46. The
provisions of FIN 46R are effective for financial periods ending

after March 15, 2004. The Firm will adopt FIN 46R at the effec-

tive date and is currently assessing the impact of FIN 46R on all

VIEs with which it is involved. Private equity investmentsPrivate equity investments are primarily held by JPMorgan

Partners (ÒJPMPÓ), the FirmÕs global private equity investment

business segment. JPMP invests in buyouts, growth equity and

venture opportunities in the normal course of business. These

investments are accounted for under investment company guide-

lines. Accordingly, these investments, irrespective of the percent-

age of equity ownership interest held by JPMP, are carried on the

Consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Realized and unrealized

gains and losses arising from changes in value are reported in

Private equity gains (losses) in the Consolidated statement of
income in the period that the gain or loss occurs.Private investments are initially valued based on cost. The carrying
values of private investments are adjusted from cost to reflect

both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events

with third-party capital providers. In addition, these investments

are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by JPMPÕs senior

investment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and

monitored to assess impairment Ð including, but not limited to,

operating performance and future expectations, comparable

industry valuations of public companies, changes in market out-
look and changes in the third-party financing environment.The

Valuation Control Group within the Finance area is responsible
for reviewing the accuracy of the carrying values of private

investments held by JPMP.
JPMP also holds public equity investments, generally obtainedthrough the initial public offering of private equity investments.

These investments are marked to market at the quoted public

value. To determine the carrying values of these investments,

JPMP incorporates the use of discounts to take into account the
fact that it cannot immediately realize or hedge the quoted 

public values as a result of regulatory, corporate and/or contrac-

tual sales restrictions imposed on these holdings.

Note 15Goodwill and other intangible assetsEffective January 1, 2002, the Firm adopted SFAS 142, reclassi-
fying certain intangible assets from Goodwill to Other intangible

assets. There was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of

SFAS 142.
Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment atthe reporting-unit segment (which is one level below the five

major business segments as described in Note 34 on pages 126-
127 of this Annual Report). Goodwill is tested annually (during
the fourth quarter) or more often if events or circumstances,

such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there

may be impairment. Other acquired intangible assets deter-

mined to have finite lives, such as core deposits and credit card

relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the

intangible asset. In addition, impairment testing is performed
periodically on these amortizing intangible assets.The following table presents the impact of SFAS 142 on net
income and earnings per share had the accounting standard

been in effect for 2001:

507507Total goodwill$8,511$8,096Mortgage servicing rightsJPMorgan Chase recognizes as intangible assets Mortgage servic-
ing rights (ÒMSRsÓ), which represent the right to perform speci-

fied residential mortgage servicing activities for others. MSRs are

either purchased from third parties or retained upon sale or

securitization of mortgage loans. Servicing activities include col-
lecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from borrowers;

making tax and insurance payments on behalf of the borrowers;

monitoring delinquencies and executing foreclosure proceed-

ings; and accounting for and remitting principal and interest

payments to the investors of the mortgage-backed securities. The amount capitalized as MSRs represents the amount paid to
third parties to acquire MSRs or is based on fair value if retained

upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans. The Firm esti-
mates the fair value of MSRs using a discounted future cash

flow model. The model considers portfolio characteristics, con-
tractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions,

delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, costs 

to service and other economic factors. The Firm compares its 

fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data
where available and to recent market activity and actual port-

folio experience. Management believes that the assumptions
used to estimate fair values are supportable and reasonable.
The Firm accounts for its MSRs at the lower of cost or market,in accordance with SFAS 140. MSRs are amortized as a reduc-

tion of the actual servicing income received in proportion to,

and over the period of the estimated future net servicing

income stream of, the underlying mortgage loans. For purposes
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
107Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
108J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
of evaluating and measuring impairment of MSRs, the Firmstratifies its portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk char-

acteristics: loan type and interest rate. Any indicated impairment

is recognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation

allowance to the extent that the carrying value of an individual
stratum exceeds its estimated fair value. The Firm evaluates other-than-temporary impairment by review-
ing changes in mortgage and other market interest rates over

historical periods and then determines an interest rate scenario

to estimate the amounts of the MSRsÕ gross carrying value and

the related valuation allowance that could be expected to be

recovered in the foreseeable future. Any gross carrying value
and related valuation allowance amount that are not expected

to be recovered in the foreseeable future, based upon the inter-

est rate scenario, are considered to be other-than-temporary.
The carrying value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest
rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. The Firm 

offsets this interest rate risk by designating certain derivatives

(e.g., a combination of swaps, swaptions and floors that pro-

duces an interest rate profile opposite to the designated risk of

the hedged MSRs) as fair value hedges of specified MSRs under
SFAS 133. SFAS 133 hedge accounting allows the carrying value

of the hedged MSRs to be adjusted through earnings in the

same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives
is recognized through earnings. Both of these valuation adjust-

ments are recorded in Mortgage fees and related income. 
When applying SFAS 133, the loans underlying the MSRs being
hedged are stratified into specific SFAS 133 similar-asset group-

ings that possess similar interest rate and prepayment risk expo-

sures. The documented hedge period for the Firm is daily. Daily

adjustments are performed to incorporate new or terminated

derivative contracts and to modify the amount of the correspon-

ding similar asset grouping that is being hedged. The Firm has

designated changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) as

the hedged risk. In designating the benchmark interest rate, the

Firm considers the impact that the change in the benchmark
rate has on the prepayment speed estimates in determining the

fair value of the MSRs. The Firm performs both prospective and

retrospective hedge effectiveness evaluations, using a regression
analysis, to determine whether the hedge relationship is expected

to be highly effective. Hedge effectiveness is assessed by 
comparing the change in the value of the MSRs as a result of
changes in benchmark interest rates to the change in the value

of the designated derivatives. For a further discussion on deriva-
tive instruments and hedging activities, see Note 28 on pages
116-117 of this Annual Report.AFS securities are also used to manage the risk exposure of
MSRs. These instruments are accounted for as stand-alone

instruments, because AFS securities do not qualify as hedges
under SFAS 133. Accordingly, the securities are accounted for as

AFS securities under SFAS 115, with realized gains and losses

recognized in earnings in Securities gains (losses); interest
income on the AFS securities is recognized in earnings in Net

interest income. Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities

are reported in Other comprehensive income. In addition, cer-

tain nonhedge derivatives, which have not been designated by
management in SFAS 133 hedge relationships, are used to man-

age the economic risk exposure of MSRs and are recorded in

Mortgage fees and related income.
The following table summarizes MSR activity and related amorti-
zation for the dates indicated. It also includes the key assumptions
and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs at December 31,
2003, to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in each of

Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.

JPMorgan Chase generally computes depreciation using the

straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset.
For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line

method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased

facility or the estimated economic life of the improvement. 
JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with theacquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the

software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized

on a straight-line basis over the softwareÕs expected useful life.
Long-term debtJPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various
currencies, although predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed

and variable interest rates. The following table is a summary of

long-term debt (net of unamortized original issue debt discount

and SFAS 133 valuation adjustments):
Note 18Note 17The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and

should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes 

in fair value based on a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions

generally cannot be easily extrapolated because the relationship

of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value
may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change 

in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated
without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in

one factor may result in changes in another, which might mag-

nify or counteract the sensitivities.The valuation allowance represents the extent to which the 
carrying value of MSRs exceeds its estimated fair value. Changes
in the valuation allowance are the result of the recognition of

impairment or the recovery of previously recognized impairment

charges due to changes in market conditions during the period.
The changes in the valuation allowance for MSRs for the dates
indicated were as follows:
Year ended December 31,(in millions)200320022001

Other-than-temporary impairment
(283)ÑÑImpairment adjustment274641,071
Balance at end of year$1,378$1,634$1,170
During 2003, the Firm recorded an other-than-temporary impair-
ment of its MSRs of $283 million, which permanently reduced

the gross carrying value of the MSRs and the related valuation

allowance. The permanent reduction precludes subsequent rever-

sals. This write-down had no impact on the results of operations

or financial condition of the Firm.Purchased credit card relationships and other 
intangible assetsNo purchased credit card relationships were acquired during
2003. Other intangibles (primarily customer relationships)

increased by approximately $428 million, principally due to the

businesses acquired by Treasury & Securities Services. All of the

FirmÕs acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization. For

the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, intangible asset
amortization expense was $294 million and $323 million, respec-

tively. Amortization expense for 2002 included a $12 million

impairment write-down on purchased credit card relationships

related to a small credit card portfolio previously acquired.

(e)At December 31,2003,long-term debt aggregating $2.0 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase,in whole or in pa
rt,prior to maturity,based on the terms specified in the respective notes.
(f)The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2003 is $6.6 billion in 2004,$9.
3 billion in 2005,$5.8 billion in 2006,$6.7 billion in 2007 and $5.9 billion 
in 2008.
(g)Includes $1.1 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31,2003.The aggregate principal amount of these notes at 
their respective maturities is $4.6 billion.The weighted-average contractual interest rate for total long-
term debt was 4.71% and 5.51% as of December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest

rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase

utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-

currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its

debt issues. The use of these instruments modifies the FirmÕs

interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weight-

ed-average interest rate for total long-term debt, including the

effects of related derivative instruments, was 2.79% and 3.42%

as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
JPMorgan Chase has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries,including both long-term debt and structured notes sold as part

of the FirmÕs trading activities. These guarantees rank on a pari-

ty with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of

JPMorgan Chase. Guaranteed liabilities totaled $509 million and
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures
held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt

securitiesAt December 31, 2003, the Firm had previously established
wholly-owned Delaware statutory business trusts (Òissuer

trustsÓ) that issued guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in

the FirmÕs junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures.

Prior to FIN 46, these issuer trusts were consolidated subsidiaries

of JPMorgan Chase; the preferred securities were included in

JPMorgan ChaseÕs Consolidated balance sheet in the Liabilities

section, under the caption ÒGuaranteed preferred beneficial

interests in capital debt securities issued by consolidated trusts,Ó

and the retained common capital securities of the issuer trusts

were eliminated against the FirmÕs investment in the issuer

trusts. Distributions on the preferred securities were recorded as

Interest expense on the Consolidated statement of income. 
As a result of the adoption of FIN 46, JPMorgan Chase decon-
solidated all the issuer trusts. As a result, the junior subordinat-

ed deferrable interest debentures issued by JPMorgan Chase 

to the issuer trusts, totaling $6.8 billion, are reflected in the

FirmÕs Consolidated balance sheet in the Liabilities section at

Preferred stock
JPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 200 million shares of 
preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1

per share. Outstanding preferred stock at both December 31,

2003 and 2002 was 17.8 million shares. The Firm did not issue,

redeem or repurchase any preferred stock during 2003 or 2002. 
Dividends on shares of each outstanding series of preferred
stock are payable quarterly. All the preferred stock outstanding

have preference over JPMorgan ChaseÕs common stock for the

payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event
of a liquidation or dissolution of JPMorgan Chase. Note 20December 31, 2003, under the caption ÒJunior subordinated

deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaran-

teed capital debt securities.Ó JPMorgan Chase records interest

expense on the corresponding junior subordinated debentures in

its Consolidated statements of income. The Firm also recorded

the common capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in Other
assets in its Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003.
The debentures issued by the issuer trusts to JPMorgan Chase, less
the capital securities of the issuer trusts, continue to qualify as Tier 1

capital under interim guidance issued by the Board of Governors

of the Federal Reserve System (the ÒFederal Reserve BoardÓ).

Note 21The Firm did not repurchase shares of its common stock during
2003 or 2002. During 2001, the Firm repurchased 21.9 million

shares of common stock under a plan which began on July 19,

2001. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 462 million unissued
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under 

various employee incentive, option and stock purchase plans. 
Earnings per share
SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings

per share (ÒEPSÓ) in the income statement. Basic EPS is computed

by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for

the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the same method as
basic EPS, but, in the denominator, common shares outstanding

reflect the potential dilution that could occur if convertible secu-rities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted

or exercised into common stock. Net income available for com-

mon stock is the same computation for basic EPS and diluted
EPS as JPMorgan Chase had no convertible securities, and,
therefore, no adjustments to net income available for common

stock were necessary.

unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, cash flow hedging

activities and foreign currency translation adjustments (including

the impact of related derivatives).

and liability method required by SFAS 109 to provide income

taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated financial

statements. This requires that income taxes reflect the expected

future tax consequences of temporary differences between the

carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes.
Accordingly, a deferred tax liability or asset for each temporary

difference is determined based on the tax rates that JPMorgan

Chase expects to be in effect when the underlying items of

income and expense are to be realized. JPMorgan ChaseÕs

expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred por-

tions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount JPMorgan Chase
expects to be realized. 
Note 24Deferred income tax expense (benefit) results from differences

between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting

and for income tax return purposes. The significant compo-

nents of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the

directly in StockholdersÕ equity. StockholdersÕ equity increased by

$898 million and $541 million in 2003 and 2001, respectively, and

decreased by $1.1 billion in 2002 as a result of these tax effects.
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
114J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on the undis-
tributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent

such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period

of time. For 2003, such earnings approximated $326 million on a

pre-tax basis. At December 31, 2003, the cumulative amount of

undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries approximated $2.3 bil-

lion. It is not practicable at this time to determine the income tax
liability that would result upon repatriation of these earnings.
The tax expense applicable to securities gains and losses for theyears 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $477 million, $531 million and
$286 million, respectively.

sidiaryÕs total capital. JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates were
well within these limits throughout the year.
The principal sources of JPMorgan ChaseÕs income (on a parent
company-only basis) are dividends and interest from JPMorgan

Chase Bank and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries
of JPMorgan Chase. In addition to dividend restrictions set 

forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve Board, the

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (ÒOCCÓ) and the

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (ÒFDICÓ) have authority
under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to

limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations
they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries
that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking

regulatorÕs opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of
the banking organization.At January 1, 2004 and 2003, JPMorgan ChaseÕs bank sub-
sidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $4.4 billion and $1.3 bil-

lion, respectively, in dividends to their respective bank holding

companies without prior approval of their relevant banking reg-

ulators. Dividend capacity in 2004 will be supplemented by the
banksÕ earnings during the year.
In compliance with rules and regulations established by U.S. and
non-U.S. regulators, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, cash

in the amount of $3.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, and

securities with a market value of $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion,
respectively, were segregated in special bank accounts for the
benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers.
CapitalThere are two categories of risk-based capital: core capital

(referred to as Tier 1 capital) and supplementary capital (referred

to as Tier 2 capital). Tier 1 capital includes common stockhold-

ersÕ equity, qualifying preferred stock and minority interest less

goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of pre-

ferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1, long-term debt and other

instruments qualifying as Tier 2, the aggregate allowance for

credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets,

less investments in certain subsidiaries. Under the risk-based
capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board, JPMorgan Chase

is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total (Tier 1

plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as minimum

leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital to average

adjusted on-balance sheet assets). Failure to meet these mini-

mum requirements could result in actions taken by the Federal

Reserve Board. Bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital

requirements by their respective primary regulators. Manage-
ment believes that as of December 31, 2003, JPMorgan Chase
and each of its banking subsidiaries met all capital requirements

to which each was subject and is not aware of any subsequent

events that would alter this classification. The Firm revised its

calculation of risk-weighted assets during the third-quarter of

2003; capital ratios for periods prior to June 2003 have not
been recalculated.
Note 26Restrictions on cash and 
intercompany funds transfers
The Federal Reserve Boardrequires depository institutions to
maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average

amount of reserve balances deposited by JPMorgan ChaseÕs

bank subsidiaries with various Federal Reserve Banks was
approximately $2.6 billion in 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2002.
Restrictions imposed by federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase
and certain other affiliates from borrowing from banking subsid-

iaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such

secured loans to JPMorgan Chase or to other affiliates generally

are limited to 10% of the banking subsidiaryÕs total capital, as

determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate

amount of all such loans is limited to 20% of the banking sub-Note 25J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report

estate taxes, they may also contain other operating expenses
and renewal option clauses calling for increased rents. No lease

agreement imposes any restrictions on the FirmÕs ability to pay

Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
116J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
Derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes mustbe considered highly effective at reducing the risk associated

with the exposure being hedged. Each derivative must be desig-

nated as a hedge, with documentation of the risk management
objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging

instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, and how

effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and retrospectively.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value ofthe derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item
for the risk being hedged are recognized in earnings. If the

hedge relationship is terminated, then the fair value adjustment

to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis

of the item and is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.

For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the

change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in Other

comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement

when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. The ineffective

portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in

earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the

change in fair value of the derivative recorded in Other compre-

hensive income is recognized when the cash flows that were

hedged occur, consistent with the original hedge strategy. For

hedge relationships discontinued because the forecasted trans-

action is not expected to occur according to the original strategy,

any related derivative amounts recorded in Other comprehensive

income are immediately recognized in earnings. For qualifying

net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the deriva-
tive or the revaluation of the foreign currencyÐdenominated

debt instrument are recorded in the translation adjustments

account within Other comprehensive income.
JPMorgan ChaseÕs fair value hedges primarily include hedges 
of fixed-rate long-term debt, loans, AFS securities and MSRs.
Interest rate swaps are the most common type of derivative 

contract used to modify exposure to interest rate risk, convert-

ing fixed-rate assets and liabilities to a floating rate. Interest rate

options and swaptions are also used in combination with inter-

est rate swaps to hedge the fair value of the FirmÕs MSRs. For a

further discussion of hedging, see Note 16 on page 108 of this
Annual Report. All amounts have been included in earnings

consistent with the classification of the hedged item, primarily
Net interest income, Mortgage fees and related income and

Other revenue. JPMorgan Chase did not recognize any gains or

losses during 2003 on firm commitments that no longer qualify
as fair value hedges.JPMorgan Chase also enters into derivative contracts to hedgeexposure to variability in cash flows from floating-rate financial

instruments and forecasted transactions, primarily the rollover of

short-term assets and liabilities, foreign currency denominated

revenues and expenses and anticipated securities transactions.Interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts are the

most common instruments used to reduce the impact of interest

rate and foreign exchange rate changes on future earnings. All

amounts have been included in earnings consistent with the

classification of the hedged item, primarily Net interest income.
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in
a number of legal actions and governmental proceedings arising

in connection with their respective businesses. Additional

actions, investigations or proceedings may be brought from time

to time in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of pre-

dicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where the

claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where

the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number

of parties, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the even-
tual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of
the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the

eventual loss related to each pending matter will be. Subject to

the foregoing caveat, JPMorgan Chase anticipates, based upon

its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and 

after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the

outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations

currently pending against it should not have a material adverse

effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Firm.

However, the outcome of a particular proceeding or the imposi-

tion of a particular fine or penalty may be material to the FirmÕs

operating results for a particular period depending upon,

among other factors, the size of the loss or liability and the level
of the FirmÕs income for that period.
Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
Derivative instruments enable end-users to increase, reduce or
alter exposure to credit or market risks. The value of a derivative

is derived from its reference to an underlying variable or combi-

nation of variables such as equity, foreign exchange, credit,

commodity or interest rate prices or indices. JPMorgan Chase

makes markets in derivatives for its customers, and also is an
end user of derivatives in order to manage the FirmÕs exposure

to credit and market risks.
SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 138 and SFAS 149, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,

including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
used for trading and hedging activities. All derivatives, whether
designated for hedging relationships or not, are required to 

be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting

for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether the
contract is for trading purposes or has been designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting. In order to qualify for hedge

accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the

risk associated with the exposure being hedged. The majority of

JPMorgan ChaseÕs derivatives are entered into for trading pur-

poses. The Firm also uses derivatives as an end-user to hedge
market exposures, modify the interest rate characteristics of

related balance sheet instruments or meet longer-term invest-
ment objectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives are

recorded at fair value in Trading assets and Trading liabilities.
Note 28J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
117JPMorgan Chase uses forward foreign exchange contracts and
foreign currencyÐdenominated debt instruments to protect the

value of its net investments in its non-U.S. subsidiaries in foreign

currencies. The portion of the hedging instruments excluded

from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (forward points) is

recorded in Net interest income.
The following table presents derivative instrument- and hedg-
ing-related activities for the period indicated:

Over the next 12 months, it is expected that $124 million (after-
tax) of net losses recorded in Other comprehensive income at

December 31, 2003, will be recognized in earnings. The maximum

length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is

10 years, related to core lending and borrowing activities.
In 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in an after-tax
reduction to net income of $25 million and an after-tax reduc-
tion to Other comprehensive income of $36 million. Due to

SFAS 133, JPMorgan Chase changed certain hedging strategies

and elected not to designate some derivatives utilized to man-
age economic exposure as accounting hedges. For example, to

moderate its use of derivatives, the mortgage business began
using AFS securities as economic hedges of mortgage servicing
rights. Changes in the fair value of credit derivatives used to

manage the FirmÕs credit risk are recorded in Trading revenue

because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges

of loans and commitments.Off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments and guaranteesJPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments
(e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing
needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these finan-
cial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk

should the counterparty draw down the commitment or the

Firm fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and the counter-
party were to subsequently fail to perform according to the

terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guaran-
tees expire without a default occurring or without being drawn.

As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is

not, in the FirmÕs view, representative of its actual future credit

exposure or funding requirements. Further, certain commit-

ments, primarily related to consumer financings, are cancelable,

upon notice, at the option of the Firm. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in commercial-related
contracts, an allowance for credit losses is maintained. See Note

12 on page 100 of this Annual Report for a further discussion of
the Allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.

FIN 45 establishes guarantorÕs accounting and disclosure require-
ments for guarantees, requiring that a guarantor recognize, 

at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal 
to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. FIN 45 defines a guarantee as a contract that contin-
gently requires the Firm to pay a guaranteed party, based on: 

(a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of
the guaranteed party, or (b) a third partyÕs failure to perform

under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following

off-balance sheet lending arrangements to be guarantees under

FIN 45: certain asset purchase agreements, standby letters of

credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifica-

tions, certain indemnification agreements included within

third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative con-

tracts. These guarantees are described in further detail below.
Note 29Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
118J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
As of January 1, 2003, newly issued or modified guaranteesthat are not derivative contracts have been recorded on the

FirmÕs Consolidated balance sheet at their fair value at inception.

The fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guar-
antee at inception is typically equal to the net present value of

the future amount of premium receivable under the contract.

The Firm has recorded this amount in Other Liabilities with an

offsetting entry recorded in Other Assets. As cash is received

under the contract, it is applied to the premium receivable recorded

in Other Assets, and the fair value of the liability recordedat

inception is amortized into income as Fees and Commissions
over the life of the guarantee contract. The amount of the 
liability r
elated to guarantees recorded at December 31, 2003,
excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related

commitments and derivative contracts discussed below, was

approximately $59 million.
Unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend
only when a customer has complied with predetermined condi-

tions, and they generally expire on fixed dates. The allowance

forcredit losses on commercial lending-related commitments

includes $155 million at December 31, 2003, related to unfunded

commitments to extend credit. The majority of the FirmÕs

unfunded commitments are not guarantees as defined in FIN

45, except for certain asset purchase agreements of $21 billion

at December 31, 2003. These agreements are primarily used as

a mechanism to provide liquidity to SPEs. Of the $21 billion of

asset purchase agreements at December 31, 2003, $18 billion

related to multi-seller conduits and structured commercial loan
vehicles described in Note 14 on pages 103-106 of this Annual
Report. It does not include $6 billion of asset purchase agree-

ments to multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduits

consolidated in accordance with FIN 46 at December 31, 2003,

as the underlying assets of the conduits are reported on the

Consolidated balance sheet.Certain asset purchase agreements can be exercised at any 
time by the SPEÕs administrator, while others require a triggering

event to occur. Triggering events include, but are not limited to,

a need for liquidity, a market value decline of the assets or a

downgrade in the rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank. These agree-

ments may cause the Firm to purchase an asset from the SPE at

an amount above the assetÕs fair value, in effect providing a

guarantee of the initial value of the reference asset as of the

date of the agreement. In most instances, third-party credit

enhancements of the SPE mitigate the FirmÕs potential losses on

these agreements. The allowance for credit losses on commer-

cial lending-related commitments related to these agreements

was insignificant at December 31, 2003. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional
lending commitments issued by JPMorgan Chase to guarantee
the performance of a customer to a third party under certain

arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financ-

ings, acquisition financings and similar transactions. More than

80% of these arrangements mature within three years. The Firm
typically has recourse to recover from the customer any amounts
paid under these guarantees; in addition, the Firm may hold
cash or other highly liquid collateral to support these guaran-
tees. At December 31, 2003, the Firm held collateral relating to

$7.7 billion of these arrangements. The allowance for credit

losses on lending-related commitments included $167 million

related to standby letters of credit and financial guarantees.
JPMorgan Chase holds customersÕ securities under custodialarrangements. At times, these securities are loaned to third 

parties, and the Firm issues securities lending indemnification
agreements to the customer that protect the customer against

the risk of loss if the third party fails to return the securities. 

To support these indemnification agreements, the Firm generally
obtains from the third party cash or other highly liquid collateral

with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the loaned
securities. At December 31, 2003, the Firm held $146.7 billion
in collateral in support of these agreements.
In connection with issuing securities to investors, the Firm mayenter into contractual arrangements with third parties that may

require the Firm to make a payment to them in the event of a
change in tax law or an adverse interpretation of tax law. In

certain cases, the contract may also include a termination clause,which would allow the Firm to settle the contract at its fair
value, thus, such a clause would not require the Firm to make 

a payment under the indemnification agreement. Even without

the termination clause, management does not expect such
indemnification agreements to have a material adverse effect 

on the consolidated financial condition of JPMorgan Chase. 
The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses when it
sells a business or assets to a third party, pursuant to which it

indemnifies that third party for losses they may incur due to

actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale. See below for more

information regarding the FirmÕs loan securitization activities. 

It is difficult to estimate the FirmÕs maximum exposure under

these indemnification arrangements, since this would require 

an assessment of future changes in tax laws and future claims

that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.

However, based on historical experience, management expects

the risk of loss to be remote.
As part of the FirmÕs loan securitization activities, as described 
in Note 13 on pages 100-103 of this Annual Report, the Firm
provides representations and warranties that certain securitized

loans meet specific requirements. The Firm may be required to

repurchase the loans and/or indemnify the purchaser of the loans
against losses due to any breaches of such representations or

warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments

the Firm would be required to make under such repurchase

and/or indemnification provisions would be equal to the current

amount of assets held by such securitization-related SPEs as of

December 31, 2003, plus, in certain circumstances, accrued and

unpaid interest on such loans and certain expenses. The potential

loss due to such repurchase and/or indemnity is mitigated by the

due diligence the Firm performs to ensure that the assets comply
J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
119with the requirements set forth in the representations and war-
ranties. Historically, losses incurred on such repurchases and/or

indemnifications have been insignificant, and therefore manage-

ment expects the risk of material loss to be remote. 
In connection with Chase Cardmember Services, the Firm is a
50% partner with one of the leading companies in electronic

payment services in a joint venture, known as Chase Merchant

Services (the Òjoint ventureÓ) that provides merchant processing

services in the United States. The joint venture is contingently

liable for processed credit card sales transactions in the event of

a dispute between the cardmember and a merchant. If a dispute

is resolved in the cardmemberÕs favor, the joint venture will cred-

it or refund the amount to the cardmember and charge back

the transaction to the merchant. If the joint venture is unable 

to collect the amount from the merchant, the joint venture will

bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the card-

member. The joint venture mitigates this risk by withholding 

settlement or obtaining escrow deposits from certain merchants.

However, in the unlikely event that: 1) a merchant ceases 

operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a

refund; 2) the joint venture does not have sufficient withhold-
ings or escrow deposits to provide customer refunds; and 

3) the joint venture does not have sufficient financial resources

to provide customer refunds, the Firm would be liable to refund

the cardholder in proportion to its equity interest in the joint

venture. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the joint 

venture incurred aggregate credit losses of $2.0 million on 

$260 billion of aggregate volume processed. At December 31,

2003, the joint venture held $242 million of collateral. The Firm

believes that, based on historical experience and the collateral
held by the joint venture, the fair value of the guarantee would

not be materially different from the credit loss allowance recorded

by the joint venture; therefore, the Firm has not recorded any

allowance for losses in excess of the allowance recorded by the

joint venture.
The Firm is a member of several securities and futures
exchanges and clearinghouses both in the United States and
overseas. Membership in some of these organizations requires

the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the

organization as a result of the default of another member. Such

obligation varies with different organizations. It may be limited

to members who dealt with the defaulting member or to the
amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the FirmÕs contribution

to a membersÕ guaranty fund, or, in a few cases, it may be

unlimited. It is difficult to estimate the FirmÕs maximum exposure

under these membership agreements, since 
this would require
an assessment of future claims that may be made againstthe

Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical

experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.
In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain
derivative contracts to which the Firm is a counterparty that
meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. These
derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet at
fair value. These contracts include written put options thatrequire the Firm to purchase assets from the option holder at 
a specified price by a specified date in the future, as well as

derivatives that effectively guarantee the return on a counter-

partyÕs reference portfolio of assets. The total notional value 

of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was
$50 billion at December 31, 2003. The Firm reduces its expo-

sures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions

or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related

to these contracts. The fair value related to these contracts was

a derivative receivable of $163 million and a derivative payable

of $333 million at December 31, 2003. Finally, certain written put options and credit derivatives permit
cash settlement and do not require the option holder or the

buyer of credit protection to own the reference asset. The Firm

does not consider these contracts to be guarantees as described
in FIN 45.Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers

are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same

geographic region, or when they have similar economic features

that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its
credit risk portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and 
to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. In the FirmÕs com-

mercial portfolio, risk concentrations are primarily evaluated by

industry, and also by geographic region. In the consumer portfo-

lio, concentrations are primarily evaluated by product, and by

U.S. geographic region.

centrations by major product and geography, see Note 11 on

page 99 of this Annual Report. For information regarding 

concentrations of offÐbalance sheet lending-related financial

instruments by major product, see Note 29 on page 117 of this

Fair value of financial instrumentsThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at whichthe instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction

between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The accounting for an asset or liability may differ based on the
type of instrument and/or its use in a trading or investing strategy.

Generally, the measurement framework recorded in financial

statements is one of the following: ¥at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet, withchanges in fair value recorded each period in the

Consolidated statement of income¥at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet, withchanges in fair value recorded each period in a separate

component of stockholdersÕ equity and as part of Other
comprehensive income
¥at cost (less other-than-temporary impairments), with
changes in fair value not recorded in the financial statements

but disclosed in the notes thereto
¥at the lower of cost or fair value.The Firm has a well-established and well-documented process
for determining fair values. Fair value is based on quoted market
prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available,

fair value is based on internally developed models that primarily

use market-based or independent information as inputs to the
valuation model. Valuation adjustments may be necessary to

ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.
Note 31Valuation adjustments include amounts to reflect counterparty
credit quality, liquidity and concentration concerns and are based

on defined methodologies that are applied consistently over time. 
¥Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market
price (or parameter) is not indicative of the credit quality of

the counterparty. As few derivative contracts are listed on 

an exchange, the majority of derivative positions are valued

using internally developed models that use as their basis

observable market parameters. Market practice is to quote
parameters equivalent to a AA credit rating: thus, all coun-

terparties are assumed to have the same credit quality. An

adjustment is therefore necessary to reflect the credit quality

of each derivative counterparty and to arrive at fair value.
Without this adjustment, derivative positions would not beappropriately valued. 
¥Liquidity adjustments are necessary when the Firm may 
not be able to observe a recent market price for a financial

instrument that trades in inactive (or less active) markets.
Thus, valuation adjustments for risk of loss due to a lack of
liquidity are applied to those positions to arrive at fair value.

The Firm tries to ascertain the amount of uncertainty in the
initial valuation based upon the liquidity or illiquidity, as the

case may be, of the market in which the instrument trades
and makes liquidity adjustments to the financial instruments.
The Firm measures the liquidity adjustment based on the

following factors: (1) the amount of time since the last rele-
vant pricing point; (2) whether there was an actual trade or

relevant external quote; and (3) the volatility of the principal
component of the financial instrument.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
121¥Concentration valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect
the cost of unwinding larger-than-normal market size risk

positions. The cost is determined based on the size of the
adverse market move that is likely to occur during the
extended period required to bring a position down to a non-

concentrated level. An estimate of the period needed to
reduce, without market disruption, a position to a noncon-centrated level is generally based on the relationship of the

position to the average daily trading volume of that position.
Without these adjustments, larger positions would be valuedat a price greater than the price at which the Firm could exit

the positions. Valuation adjustments are determined based on established poli-
cies and are controlled by a price verification group independent

of the risk-taking function. Economic substantiation of models,
prices, market inputs and revenue through price/input testing,

as well as backtesting, is done to validate the appropriateness 

of the valuation methodology. Any changes to the valuation

methodology are reviewed by management to ensure the changes

are justified. 
The methods described above may produce a fair value calcula-
tion that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflec-

tive of future fair values. Furthermore, the use of different

methodologies to determine the fair value of certain financial
instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at

the reporting date. 
Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instrumentsare excluded from the scope of SFAS 107. Accordingly, the fair

value disclosures required by SFAS 107 provide only a partial

estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the
Firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers

through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly

referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relation-
ships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggre-

gate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair
value is not disclosed in this Note.The following captions describe the methodologies and assump-tions used, by financial instrument, to determine fair value.Financial assetsAssets for which fair value approximates carrying value
The Firm considers fair values of certain financial assets carriedat cost Ð including cash and due from banks, deposits with

banks, securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued

interest receivable Ð to approximate their respective carrying

values, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible
credit risk.
Assets where fair value differs from cost
JPMorgan ChaseÕs debt, equity and derivative trading instru-

ments are carried at their estimated fair value. Quoted market

prices, when available, are used to determine the fair value of

trading instruments. If quoted market prices are not available,

then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted

prices of instruments with similar characteristics or discounted
cash flows.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agree-
ments are typically short-term in nature, and as such, for a 

significant majority of the FirmÕs transactions, cost approximates

carrying value. This balance sheet item also includes structured

resale agreements and similar products with long-dated maturi-
ties. To estimate the fair value of these instruments, the cash

flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates for the

applicable maturity. 
SecuritiesFair values of actively traded securities are determined by the

secondary market, while the fair values for nonactively traded
securities are based on independent broker quotations.
DerivativesFair value for derivatives is determined based on the following:¥position valuation, principally based on liquid market pricingas evidenced by exchange-traded prices, broker-dealer 

quotations or related input parameters which assume all

counterparties have the same credit rating;
¥credit valuation adjustments to the resulting portfolio valua-
tion, to reflect the credit quality of individual counterparties;

and¥other fair value adjustments to take into consideration liquidity, concentration and other factors. 
LoansFair value for loans is determined using methodologies suitable
for each type of loan: ¥Fair value for the commercial loan portfolio is based on the
assessment of the two main risk components of the portfo-
lio: credit and interest. The cost of credit derivatives is used

to estimate the fair value of commercial loans.
Notes to consolidated financial statementsJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
122J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report
¥Fair values for consumer installment loans (including auto-mobile financings) and 1Ð4 family residential mortgages, for

which market rates for comparable loans are readily avail-

able, are based on discounted cash flows, adjusted for pre-

payments. The discount rates used for consumer installment
loans are current rates offered by commercial banks. For 1Ð4

family residential mortgages, secondary market yields for com-

parable mortgage-backed securities, adjusted for risk, are used.
¥Fair value for credit card receivables is based on discounted
expected cash flows. The discount rates used for credit card

receivables incorporate only the effects of interest rate
changes, since the expected cash flows already reflect an

adjustment for credit risk.
¥The fair value of loans in the held-for-sale and trading port-
folios is generally based on observable market prices and
prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit deriva-

tives and loans with similar characteristics. Otherwise, if 
market prices are not available, the fair value is based on 

the estimated cash flows adjusted for credit risk; that risk is

discounted, using a rate appropriate for each maturity that

incorporates the effects of interest rate changes. 
Other assets This caption includes private equity investments and MSRs. For a discussion of the fair value methodology for private equityinvestments, see Note 15 on page 106 of this Annual Report.For a discussion of the fair value methodology for MSRs, seeNote 16 on pages 107-109 of this Annual Report.Financial liabilitiesLiabilities for which fair value approximates 
carrying valueSFAS 107 requires that the fair value disclosed for deposit liabili-
ties with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain
money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value. SFAS

107 does not allow for the recognition of the inherent funding

value of these instruments.Fair value of commercial paper, other borrowed funds, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities is considered to approximate their

respective carrying values due to their short-term nature.
Interest-bearing deposits
Fair values of interest-bearing deposits are estimated by dis-
counting cash flows based on the remaining contractual maturi-

ties of funds having similar interest rates and similar maturities.
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements are typically short-term in nature, and as such, for a 

significant majority of the FirmÕs transactions, cost approximates

carrying value. This balance sheet item also includes structured

repurchase agreements and similar products with long-dated
maturities. To estimate the fair value of these instruments, the

cash flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates

for the applicable maturity. 
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs (Òbeneficial

interestsÓ) are 
generally short-term in nature, and as such, for 
a significant majority of the FirmÕs transactions, cost approxi-

mates carrying value. The Consolidated balance sheet also
includes beneficial interests with long-dated maturities. The fair

value of these instruments is based on current market rates. 
Long-term debt-related instruments
Fair value for long-term debt, including the guaranteed preferred

beneficial interests in the FirmÕs junior subordinated deferrable

interest debentures, is based on current market rates and is

adjusted for JPMorgan ChaseÕs credit quality.
Lending-related commitments
The Firm estimates the fair value of its commercial commitments

to extend credit based on the cost of credit derivatives. The Firm

estimates the fair value of its consumer commitments to extend
credit based on the primary market prices to originate new com-

mitments. It is the change in current primary market prices that

provides the estimate of the fair value of these commitments.
On this basis, at December 31, 2003, the fair value of the FirmÕs
lending-related commitments approximated the Allowance for

lending-related commitments of $324 million. At December 31,

2002, the fair value of the FirmÕs lending-related commitments

was approximately $1.3 billion, compared with the Allowance

for lending-related commitments of $363 million.

International operations 
The following table presents income statement information of
JPMorgan Chase by major geographic areas. The Firm defines

international activities as business transactions that involve cus-

tomers residing outside the United States, and the information

presented below is based primarily on the domicile of the cus-

tomer. However, many of the FirmÕs U.S. operations serve inter-

national businesses.Note 32As the FirmÕs operations are highly integrated, estimates and

subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue

and expense between U.S. and international operations. The

estimates and assumptions used to apportion revenue and

expense are consistent with the allocations used for JPMorgan

ChaseÕs segment reporting as set forth in Note 34 on pages

126-127 of this Annual Report. The FirmÕs long-lived assets for the periods presented are not
considered by management to be significant in relation to total

assets. The majority of the FirmÕs long-lived assets are located in

the United States.J.P.Morgan Chase & Co./2003 Annual Report

Operating revenue and expense directly associated with each
segment are included in determining the segmentÕs operating

earnings. Guidelines exist for allocating to the segments expenses

that are not directly incurred by them, such as corporate over-

head. In addition, management has developed a risk-adjusted
capital methodology that quantifies the different types of risk Ð

credit, market, operational, business and private equity Ð within

the various businesses and assigns capital accordingly. Each

business segment is responsible for its credit costs, including

actual net charge-offs and changes in the specific and 
Segment informationJPMorgan Chase is organized into five major businesses. These
businesses are segmented based on the products and services

provided, or the type of customer served, and reflect the man-

ner in which financial information is evaluated by management. JPMorgan Chase uses shareholder value added (ÒSVAÓ) and
operating earnings as its principal measures of segment 

profitability. For a definition of these measurements, see the

expected components of the Allowance for credit losses. The
residual component of the Allowance for credit losses, available
for losses in any business segment, is maintained at the corpo-
rate level.A summary of the business segment results is shown in the 
following table. The Corporate/reconciling items column reflects

revenue and expense excluded from the determination of the
segmentsÕ operating earnings. This column includes the

accounting effects remaining at the corporate level after the
application of management accounting policies, includingincome tax expenses (the difference between the amounts allo-

cated to business units and JPMorgan ChaseÕs consolidated

income tax expense). For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan ChaseÕs business
segments, see Segment results in the MD&A on pages 27-44 of

this Annual Report. Additionally, financial information relating to

JPMorgan ChaseÕs operations by geographic area is provided in

AICPA:
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.APB:Accounting Principles Board Opinion.
APB 25: ÒAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees.ÓAsset capital tax: Capital allocated to each business segmentbased on its average asset level and certain off-balance sheet

credit-related exposures; reflects the need for the Firm to main-

tain minimum leverage ratios to meet bank regulatory defini-

tions of Òwell capitalized.Ó Assets Under Management: Represent assets managed by
Investment Management & Private Banking on behalf of institu-
tional, retail and private banking clients. 
Assets Under Supervision: Represent assets under management
as well as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts.
Average Allocated Capital:Represents the portion of average
common stockholdersÕ equity allocated to the business segments,
based on their respective risks. The total average allocated capi-

tal of all business segments equals the total average common
stockholdersÕ equity of the Firm.Average Managed Assets: Includes credit card receivables that
have been securitized.Basis point value (ÒBPVÓ): This measurement quantifies the
change in the market value of assets and liabilities (that are not

part of trading activities) that would result from a one-basis-

point change in interest rates or a one-basis-point widening of

interest rate spreads. BPV shows whether an increase of 1/100

of 1% (or one basis point) in a market rate will yield a profit or

loss, and of what magnitude. bp:Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.Credit derivatives
are contractual agreements that provide
protection against a credit event of one or more referenced

credits. The nature of a credit event is established by the protec-

tion buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transac-

tion, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure

to meet payment obligations when due. The buyer of the credit

derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the

protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event. 
Credit risk: 
Risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. 
Criticized:An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan
ChaseÕs internal risk assessment system. ÒCriticizedÓ assets gen-

erally represent a risk profile similar to a rating of a CCC+/Caa1

or lower, as defined by the independent rating agencies.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
are contracts that involve
the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two dif-

ferent currencies. Also see Interest rate swaps in this glossary.

Foreign exchange contracts
are contracts that provide for 
the future receipt and delivery of foreign currency at previously

agreed-upon terms.
Interest rate options
, including caps and floors, are contracts
to modify interest rate risk in exchange for the payment of a pre-

mium when the contract is initiated. A writer of interest rate

options receives a premium in exchange for bearing the risk of

unfavorable changes in interest rates. Conversely, a purchaser of

an option pays a premium for the right, but not the obligation,

to buy or sell a financial instrument or currency at predetermined

terms in the future. 
Interest rate swaps 
are contracts in which a series of interest
rate payments in a single currency are exchanged over a pre-

scribed period. An example of a situation in which an interest

rate swap would be used would be to convert fixed-rate debt to

a variable rate. By entering into the swap, the principal amount
of the debt would remain unchanged, but the interest streams

would change from fixed to variable. 
Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on
JPMorgan ChaseÕs internal risk assessment system. ÒInvestment-

gradeÓ generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a

BBB-/Baa3 or better, as defined by independent rating agencies. 
Liquidity risk: 
The risk of being unable to fund a portfolio ofassets at appropriate maturities and rates, and the risk of being

unable to liquidate a position in a timely manner at a reasonable

price. Managed credit card receivables
or managed basis: 
Refersto credit card receivables on the FirmÕs balance sheet plus credit

card receivables that have been securitized.

Mark-to-market exposure is a 
measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative or for-

eign exchange contract in the open market. When the mark-to-

JPMorgan Chase and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the

Firm. When the mark-to-market value is negative, JPMorgan
Chase owes the counterparty. In this situation, the Firm does

not have repayment risk. 
Market risk: The potential loss in value of portfolios and finan-cial instruments caused by movements in market variables, such
as interest and foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity

and commodity prices. Master netting agreement: 
An agreement between two
counterparties that have multiple derivative contracts with 
each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts

through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of

Enron surety litigation and the establishment of a litigation

reserve, and a $98 million charge for excess real estate capacity
