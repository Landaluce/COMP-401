   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   3Performance, governance and compensation highlights
1 JPMorgan Chase & Co. continued its strong performance in 2015 under the leadership of Mr. Dimon and the Firm™ssenior management and the oversight of our Board of Directors. Below are highlights relating to the Firm™s performance
and compensation program, including key changes made taking into account feedback from shareholder engagement.Strong 2015
performance
continues to
support sustained
shareholder valueWe generated 13% return on tangible common equity (ﬁROTCEﬂ), as well as record net 
income and record earnings per share (ﬁEPSﬂ) in 2015. Each of our leading client franchises 

exhibited strong performance and together delivered significant value.
We delivered 8% total shareholder return (ﬁTSRﬂ) in 2015, following 10% in 2014, and 
continued our record of outperforming the financial services industry TSR since 2008.
We reduced expenses by over $2 billion and delivered significant operating leverage, while 
continuing to invest in marketing, technology and people to grow the business.
We continued to simplify and de-risk our balance sheet, reducing our global systematically 
important bank (ﬁGSIBﬂ) surcharge by 100 basis points (ﬁbpsﬂ) during 2015 and helping us 
optimize capital return to shareholders.
We maintain
fortress operating
principles with a
focus on risk,
controls and
culturee maintained our fortress balance sheet, growing our Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In 
common equity Tier 1 (ﬁCET1ﬂ) capital ratio by 140 bps and our tangible book value per 

share (ﬁTBVPSﬂ) by 8%, and maintaining $496 billion of high quality liquid assets.
Since 2011, our total headcount associated with controls has gone from 24,000 people to 
43,000 people, and our total annual control spend has gone from $6 billion to approximately 

$9 billion over that same time period. We have more work to do, but a strong and permanent 
foundation is in place.
We continued to strengthen and reinforce our culture and business principles.
We are committed
to good corporate
governance and are
engaged with our
shareholdersSince 2011, four independent directors have joined the Board; the Board maintains a robust
Lead Independent Director role.
Our Board has endorsed the Shareholder Director Exchange (SDX) Protocol as a guide for 
engagement; in 2015, our shareholder engagement initiatives included:
  more than 90 calls and meetings on strategy, governance and compensation topics with
    shareholders representing over 40% of our shares
  presentations by Firm senior management at 13 investor conferences
  separate outreach sessions regarding our Corporate Responsibility initiatives 
Since the 2015 annual meeting, our engagement process, and the feedback gained from it, 
was a significant factor in the Board™s adoption of: (i) a clawback disclosure policy; (ii) a proxy 
access By-law amendment; and (iii) a Performance Share Unit (ﬁPSUﬂ) program for members 
of the Operating Committee (ﬁOCﬂ).
Our compensation 

program is rigorous 

and long-term 
focused 
Our compensation program reflects the Board™s philosophy of linking compensation to the 
Firm™s long-term performance including: (i) Business Results; (ii) Risk & Control; (iii) Customer 
& Clients; and (iv) People Management & Leadership.
In January 2016, the Board approved the grant of PSUs to OC members under the Firm™s 
variable compensation program. PSUs will be earned based on the Firm™s ROTCE over a 3-year 

performance period (see page 49 for details).
The majority of OC members™ pay is delivered in equity with multi-year vesting.
We have strong stock ownership and retention requirements and long-standing clawback 
provisions applicable to both cash incentives and equity awards.
CEO pay level
reflects our
performance. Dimon and the other Named Executive Officers (ﬁNEOsﬂ) delivered strong Firm, line of 
business and individual performance in 2015, continuing their momentum from 2014.
xceptional multi-year performance and outstanding performance in 2015, the 
Compensation & Management Development Committee (ﬁCMDCﬂ) and Board awarded Mr. 

Dimon total compensation of $27.0 million, with $20.5 million of the variable portion in the 

form of PSUs, which will not vest unless a threshold performance level is achieved over a 
    3-year period.

reflects his outstanding performance against four broad performance categories, which the Board uses to assess his 

performance, including:
Business Results: 
 Exceptional multi-year performance, including strong financial results and substantial progress 
on long-term objectives such as business simplification, optimization of the balance sheet, reduction of the GSIB 

surcharge and expense reduction. Additionally, the Firm achieved strong 2015 performance, including 13% 

ROTCE, record net income, and record EPS.
Risk & Control:  
Significant enhancements to our control environment, improving both the effectiveness and 

efficiency, and reinforcement of our Firm culture, by embedding our corporate standards throughout the 

employee life cycle.
Customer & Clients: 
 Market leadership of our four franchises through significant investments in product 

innovation and leading edge technologies.
People Management & Leadership:
  Significant investment in our
 people, including  enhancing diversity programs, 
building a pipeline of leaders, and developing outstanding talent across the organization.   
The Board considered several other factors
, some of which are set forth on pages 50-52 of this proxy statement.
CEO COMPENSATION IS ALIGNED WITH LONG-TERM PERFORMANCEVariability in Mr. Dimon™s pay over the last eight years illustrates our commitment to paying for performance

Proposal 1 Š Election of directors
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYOur Board has nominated 11 directors for election at 
this year™s annual meeting to hold office until the next 

annual meeting. All of the nominees are currently 

directors and were elected to the Board by our 

shareholders at our 2015 annual meeting, each with 

the support of more than 95% of votes cast. Each has 

agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to 

serve if elected. All of the nominees are expected to 

attend our May 17, 2016, annual meeting. 
We know of no reason why any of the nominees would 
be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if 

any of our nominees is unavailable for election, the 

proxies intend to vote your common stock for any 

substitute nominee proposed by the Board of Directors.
We believe that each nominee has the skills, experience 
and personal qualities the Board seeks in its directors 

and that the combination of these nominees creates an 

effective and well-functioning Board with a diversity of 

backgrounds, experiences and skill sets that together 

serve the best interests of the Firm and our 

shareholders.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing 
management and providing sound governance on 

behalf of shareholders. Risk management oversight is a 

key priority. The Board carries out its responsibilities 

through, among other things, highly capable 

independent directors, the Lead Independent Director, 

a strong committee structure and adherence to our 

Corporate Governance Principles. The Board conducts 

an annual assessment aimed at enhancing its 

effectiveness, as described on page 26 of this proxy 

statement. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESSAs specified in its charter, the Board™s Corporate 

Governance & Nominating Committee (ﬁGovernance 

Committeeﬂ) oversees the candidate nomination 

process, which includes the evaluation of both existing 

Board members and new candidates for Board 

membership. The Governance Committee recommends 

to the Board a slate of candidates for election at each 

annual meeting of shareholders. The Governance 

Committee™s goal is to put forth a diverse slate of 
candidates with a combination of skills, experience and 

personal qualities that will well serve the Board and its 

committees, our Firm and our shareholders. The 

Governance Committee considers all relevant attributes 

of each Board candidate, including professional skills, 

experience and knowledge, as well as gender, race, 

ethnicity, nationality and background.
Director succession is also a focus of the Governance 
Committee and the Board. The Governance Committee 

seeks to maintain an appropriate balance of Board 

refreshment and Firm experience. In service of this 

goal, the Firm maintains a director retirement policy 

that requires any director to offer not to stand for re-

election in each calendar year following a year in which 

the director will be 72 or older. The Board (other than 

the affected director) then determines whether or not 

to accept the offer. In 2015, the Board updated this 

policy by affirmatively stating its view that directors 

may make very meaningful contributions to the Board 

and the Firm well beyond the age of 72. The Board 

believes that, while refreshment is an important 

consideration in assessing Board composition, the best 

interests of the Firm are served by being able to take 

advantage of all available talent and the Board should 

not make determinations with regard to membership 

based solely on age. 
Consistent with the director retirement policy described 
above, two of our director nominees, Lee R. Raymond 

and Laban P. Jackson, Jr., offered not to stand for re-

election this year. The Board reviewed the offers of Mr. 

Raymond and Mr. Jackson, taking into account ongoing 

succession planning for the Board and the contributions 

of each of them to the Firm™s governance. This review 

also took into account the results of the annual Board 

and Committee self-assessment processes. The Board 

determined that Mr. Raymond and Mr. Jackson each 

reflects the capability and judgment the Board looks for 

in a director, that each has broad experience both 

within and outside the Firm that has been and 

continues to be of great value to the Board and that 

their continued service as directors would be in the 

interests of the Firm™s shareholders. Mr. Raymond 

brings strong leadership skills as Lead Independent 

Director and as Chairman of the Compensation & 

Management Development Committee. Mr. Jackson is 

active as Chairman of the Audit Committee and takes a

   11leading role in liaising with regulators worldwide. Both 
are also active in shareholder engagement. Following 

this review, the Board determined (with the affected 

director abstaining with respect to himself) that both 

Mr. Raymond and Mr. Jackson should be re-nominated 

for election as directors and therefore not accept either 

offer. For specific information on each of Mr. Raymond™s 

and Mr. Jackson™s qualifications and their individual 

contributions to the Board, including their Board 

Committee roles, please see pages 18 and 17, 

respectively, of this proxy statement. For a description 

of the annual Board and Committee self-assessment 
process, please see page 26 of this proxy statement
.As part of planning for director succession, the 
Governance Committee engages in frequent 

consideration of potential Board candidates and is 

assisted in identifying potential Board candidates by a 

third-party advisor. Of the Board™s 10 independent 

directors, four have joined the Board since 2011.
Candidates for director may be recommended by 
current Board members, our management, 

shareholders or third-party advisors. Shareholders who 

want to recommend a candidate for election to the 

Board may do so by writing to the Corporate Secretary 

at: JPMorgan Chase & Co., 270 Park Avenue, New York, 

NY 10017; or by sending an e-mail to the Office of the 

Secretary at corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com. The 

Governance Committee considers shareholder-

recommended candidates on the same basis as 

nominees recommended by Board members, 

management and third-party advisors. 
In addition to the nomination process described above, 
pursuant to new By-law Section 1.10 adopted in 

January 2016, shareholders meeting certain minimum 

ownership requirements now have the right, under 

specified conditions, to include nominees for director in 

the Firm™s proxy statement. This right of ﬁproxy accessﬂ 

is described in more detail on page 33 of this proxy 

statement and was adopted by the Board after 

consideration of a variety of views on the topic, 

including views gained through the Firm™s engagement 

with shareholders.

Corporate governance
Our commitment to good corporate governance is 
integral to our business. Our key governance practices 

are described below.
PRINCIPLESIn performing its role, our Board of Directors is guided 

by our Corporate Governance Principles, which 

establish a framework for the governance of the Board 

and the management of our Firm. The principles are 

approved by the Board and reflect appropriate and 

broadly recognized governance practices and 

regulatory requirements, including the New York Stock 

Exchange (ﬁNYSEﬂ) corporate governance listing 

standards. They are reviewed periodically and updated 

as appropriate. The full text of the Corporate 

Governance Principles is posted on our website at 

jpmorganchase.com, under the heading Governance, 

which is under the About Us tab.
BOARD STRUCTURE AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight 

of management on behalf of our Firm™s shareholders. 

The Board and its committees meet throughout the 

year to: (i) review and, where appropriate, approve 

strategy, business and financial planning and 

performance, risk, control and financial reporting and 

audit matters, compensation and management 

development, corporate culture and public 

responsibility matters; and (ii) provide oversight and 

guidance to, and regularly assess the performance of, 

the Chief Executive Officer (ﬁCEOﬂ) and other senior 

executives. 
The Board™s leadership structure, described below, is 
designed to promote Board effectiveness and to ensure 

that authority and responsibility are effectively 

allocated between the Board and management. The 

Board considers its leadership structure frequently as 

part of its succession planning process for senior 

management and the Board. The Board formally 

reviews its leadership structure not less than annually 

as part of its self-assessment process. 
The Board believes it is important to retain flexibility to 
determine the best leadership structure for any 

particular set of circumstances and personnel. These 

decisions should not be mechanical; they should be 
contextual and based on the particular composition of 

the Board, the individual serving as CEO and the needs 

and opportunities of the Firm as they change over time. 
Factors the Board may consider as part of its review of 
its leadership structure include:
A review of the respective responsibilities for the
positions of Chairman, Lead Independent Director

and CEO
Evaluation of the policies and practices in place to

provide independent Board oversight of

management (including Board oversight of CEO

performance and compensation; regularly held

executive sessions of the independent directors;

Board input into agendas and meeting materials;

and Board self-assessment)
The people currently in leadership roles
The Firm™s circumstances at the time, including

performance
The potential impact of particular leadership

structures on the Firm™s performance
The Firm™s ability to attract and retain qualified

individuals for Firm and Board leadership positions
The views of our shareholders
Legislative and regulatory developments regarding

board leadership structures
Trends in corporate governance, including practices

at other companies, and academic studies on board

leadership structures and the impact of leadership

structures on shareholder value
Such other factors as the Board may determine
We continue to address shareholder views about Board 

leadership structure in our shareholder outreach 

program and regularly share the information gathered 

through this program with the Board.
Our Board, early in 2016, reviewed its leadership 
structure, taking into consideration the factors outlined 

above and feedback from shareholders, and 

determined that, at the present time, combining the 

roles of Chairman and CEO, together with a strong Lead 

Independent Director role, continues to provide the 

appropriate leadership for and oversight of the Firm 

and facilitates effective functioning of both the Board

more than three audit committees.
Our Board™s Corporate Governance Principles provide 
that Board members have complete access to 

management, and that the Board and its committees 

have the authority and the resources to seek legal or 

other expert advice from sources independent of 

management. The committees report their activities to, 

and discuss their recommendations with, the full Board.
The following highlights some of the key responsibilities 
of each standing committee. For additional information 

on the role of certain of the standing committees in 

connection with risk management oversight see page

Public Responsibility Committee

Assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm™s positions

and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm™s 

values and character and impact the Firm™s reputation, 

including:
Community investment
Fair lending

responsibilities to assess and manage:
The Firm™s credit risk, market risk, structural interest 
rate risk, principal risk, liquidity risk, country risk 

and model riskThe governance frameworks or policies for 

operational risk, compliance risk including fiduciary 

risk, and reputational risk
Capital and liquidity planning and analysis and 

approve the Firm™s Risk Appetite Policy and other 

policies it designates as Primary Risk Policies 
The Board has two additional standing committees and 
may establish additional such committees as needed:
Stock Committee 
The committee is responsible for implementing the 

declaration of dividends, authorizing the issuance of 

stock, administering the dividend reinvestment plan 

and implementing share repurchase plans. The 

committee acts within Board-approved limitations and 

capital plans.Executive Committee
The committee may exercise all the powers of the 

Board that lawfully may be delegated, but with the 
expectation that it would not take material actions 

absent special circumstances.
Specific Purpose Committees
The Board establishes committees as appropriate to 

address specific issues (ﬁSpecific Purpose 

Committeesﬂ). The Board currently has four such 

committees to provide required oversight in connection 

with certain regulatory orders (ﬁConsent Ordersﬂ) 

issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (ﬁFederal Reserveﬂ) and the Office of 

the Comptroller of the Currency (ﬁOCCﬂ):
 BSA/AML (Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering) 
Compliance Committee
FX (Foreign Exchange)/Markets Orders Compliance 

Committee
 Sworn Documents Compliance Committee
 Trading Compliance Committee
Each Specific Purpose Committee formed to provide 

Consent Order oversight is comprised of two to four 

independent directors. They meet to provide oversight 

for specific aspects of our control agenda and to 

monitor progress under action plans developed by 

management to address the issues identified under the 

applicable Consent Order.
Additional Specific Purpose Committees may be 
established from time to time to address other issues. 

The Omnibus Demand Committee is a Specific Purpose 

Committee established to review shareholder demands 

made in connection with pending or potential 

shareholder derivative litigation. 
As the Firm achieves its objectives in a specific area, we 
expect the relevant Specific Purpose Committee will 

meet less frequently and eventually their work will be 

concluded, at which time, subject to regulatory consent 

where applicable, the committee will be disbanded. 
In January 2016, the OCC terminated its mortgage-
related Consent Order and as a result, the Mortgage 

Compliance Committee work, including oversight 

required for the related Federal Reserve Consent Order, 

has been transitioned to the Audit Committee.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
BOARD™S ROLE IN RISK MANAGEMENTOVERSIGHTRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase™s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or 

wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment 

decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 

products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of 

risk. The Firm™s overall objective is to manage its 

businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that 
balances serving the interests of our clients, customers 

and investors and protects the safety and soundness of 

the Firm.
The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk 
principally through the Directors™ Risk Policy 

Committee, Audit Committee and, with respect to 

compensation and other management-related matters, 

Compensation & Management Development Committee. 

Each committee of the Board oversees reputation risk 

issues within its scope of responsibility.
Directors™ Risk Policy Committee
The DRPC oversees the Firm™s global risk management 

framework and approves the primary risk-management 

policies of the Firm. The DRPC™s responsibilities include 

oversight of management™s exercise of its responsibility 

to assess and manage risks of the Firm, as well as its 

capital and liquidity planning and analysis. Breaches in 

risk appetite tolerances, liquidity issues that may have 

a material adverse impact on the Firm and other 

significant risk-related matters are escalated to the 

DRPC.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight 

of management™s responsibilities to assure that there is 

an effective system of controls reasonably designed to 

safeguard the assets and income of the Firm, assure 

the integrity of the Firm™s financial statements and 

maintain compliance with the Firm™s ethical standards, 

policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and 

regulations. In addition, the Audit Committee assists 

the Board in its oversight of the Firm™s independent 

registered public accounting firm™s qualifications and 

independence. The independent Internal Audit function 

at the Firm is headed by the General Auditor, who 

reports to the Audit Committee.
Compensation & Management Development 

Committee

The CMDC assists the Board in its oversight of the 

Firm™s compensation programs and reviews and 

approves the Firm™s overall compensation philosophy, 

incentive compensation pools, and compensation 

practices consistent with key business objectives and 

safety and soundness. The CMDC reviews Operating 

Committee members™ performance against their goals, 

and approves their compensation awards. The CMDC 

also periodically reviews the Firm™s diversity programs 

and management development and succession 

planning, and provides oversight of the Firm™s culture 

and conduct programs.
BOARD ASSESSMENTThe Board conducts an annual self-assessment aimed 

at enhancing its effectiveness. Through regular 

assessment of its policies, procedures and 

performance, the Board identifies areas for further 

consideration and improvement. In assessing itself, the 

Board takes a multi-year perspective.
The assessment is led by the independent directors and 
guided by the Lead Independent Director. Each director 

is expected to participate and provide feedback on a 

range of issues, including: the Board™s overall 

effectiveness; Board composition; the Lead 

Independent Director™s performance; committee 

structure; the flow of information received from Board 

committees and management; the nature and scope of 

agenda items; and shareholder communication. 
In 2015, the Board™s self-assessment also considered 
actions taken to fulfill responsibilities under the OCC™s 

ﬁHeightened Standardsﬂ for large national banks, 

including: the requirement that the board of directors 

require management to establish and implement an 

effective risk governance framework; provide active 

oversight of the banking subsidiaries™ risk-taking 

activities; exercise independent judgement; and provide 

ongoing training to directors.
Each of the principal standing committees also 
conducts an annual self-assessment. These 

assessments are led by the respective committee chairs 

and generally include, among other topics, a review of 

the committee charter, the agenda for the coming year 

and the flow of information received from 

management.

BOARD COMMUNICATIONThe Board plays a key role in communicating our Firm™s 

strategy and commitment to doing business in 

accordance with our corporate standards. The Board, 

as a group or a subset of one or more of its members, 

meets throughout the year with the Firm™s senior 

executives, shareholders, regulators and organizations 

interested in our strategy, performance or business 

practices. 
Shareholder engagement
Engagement and transparency with our shareholders 

help the Firm gain useful feedback on a wide variety of 

topics, including corporate governance, compensation 

practices, shareholder communication, Board 

composition, shareholder proposals, business 

performance and the operation of the Firm. This 

information is shared regularly with the Firm™s 

management and the Board and is considered in the 

processes that set the governance practices and 

strategic direction for the Firm. We also focus on 

shareholder feedback to better tailor the public 

information we provide to address the interests and 

inquiries of our shareholders and other interested 

parties.
The Firm interacts and communicates with 
shareholders in a number of forums, including 

quarterly earnings presentations, SEC filings, the 

Annual Report and proxy statement, the annual 

meeting, the annual Investor Day presentation, investor 

conferences and web communications. We also conduct 

a formal shareholder outreach program twice a year. 

This program covers a wide array of topics with a broad 

group of shareholders and shareholder feedback is 

regularly provided to the Board and the Firm™s 

management. Discussions during the lead up to our 

annual meeting in the Spring are usually focused on 

specific issues related to the proxy statement while 

discussions at other times of the year are typically 

focused on corporate governance and other topics of 

interest to our shareholders. This engagement process, 

including the feedback gained from it, was a significant 

factor in the Board™s adoption of several new 

compensation and governance measures since the 
2015 annual meeting. These new measures included a 

clawback disclosure policy, a Performance Share Unit 

plan for members of the Operating Committee and a 

proxy access By-law, each of which is described in more 

detail elsewhere in this proxy statement.
In 2015, management outreach efforts included the 
following:
Hosted more than 90 shareholder outreach 
discussions, covering shareholders representing in 

the aggregate over 40% of our outstanding 

common stock - similar to our 2014 outreach 

program. Topics included:
company strategy and performance
management and Board compensation
Board structure and composition
Corporate Governance Principles and By-laws, 

including proxy access
succession planning
disclosures - proxy format and content, including 

clawback disclosure
Members of senior management participated in 

more than 50 investor meetings and presented at 

13 investor conferences in 2015. Members of 

senior management also held 10 investor trips 

during 2015 throughout the U.S., as well as 

international trips to Asia and Europe, during which 

they met in person with shareholders and other 

interested parties.
In addition, the Board has endorsed the Shareholder-

Director Exchange (SDX) Protocol as a guide for 

effective, mutually beneficial engagement between 

shareholders and directors. During 2015, members of 

the Board met with shareholders to discuss a variety of 

topics, including the Firm™s strategy, performance, 

governance and compensation practices.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
Relationship with regulators
We are committed to transparency and responsiveness 

in our extensive interactions with our regulators. That 

means providing them with complete, accurate and 

timely information and maintaining an open, ongoing 

dialogue. Our senior leaders, including our Board, 

continued to commit significant time to meet with our 

regulators in 2015. Such frequent interaction helps us 

hear firsthand from regulators and gives us a forum for 

keeping them well-informed on our businesses. 
Our primary U.S. regulators meet with various Board 
committees and individual Board members to discuss 

regulators™ expectations on effective Board oversight. 

In 2015, certain of our independent Board members 

met with several of our U.S. regulators, including: the 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

(ﬁFederal Reserveﬂ); the Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency (ﬁOCCﬂ); the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (ﬁFDICﬂ), as well as the U.S. Securities and 

Exchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ), the Financial Industry 

Regulatory Authority (ﬁFINRAﬂ) and the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau (ﬁCFPBﬂ). Certain of our 

independent Board members also met with 

international regulators, including: the Prudential 

Regulation Authority (ﬁPRAﬂ) and the Financial Conduct 

Authority (ﬁFCAﬂ) in the United Kingdom; the Hong 

Kong Monetary Authority (ﬁHKMAﬂ); the China Banking 

Regulatory Commission (ﬁCBRCﬂ); the Japan Financial 

Services Agency (ﬁFSAﬂ); and the Monetary Authority of 

Singapore (ﬁMASﬂ); as well as with various additional 

regulators in these countries and others.
Communication of our corporate standards
The Board has been engaged with management on the 

importance of strong corporate standards and the need 

to reinforce the Firm™s commitment to doing business 

the right way and to establish a clear and common 

vocabulary for communicating this commitment.
Our directors frequently engage on the topic of culture 
and conduct in Board and Board committee meetings, 

including in the Specific Purpose Committees, in their 

oversight of progress addressing regulatory order 

issues. Recognizing the increasing importance of these 

issues, in 2015, the Compensation & Management 

Development Committee charter was amended to 

provide that the committee has primary responsibility 

for Board oversight of the Firm™s Culture and Conduct 

programs. Board level engagement on culture and 

conduct also includes the Audit Committee™s oversight 
of the Code of Conduct program and the CMDC™s review 

and approval of the Firm™s compensation and 

performance management processes.
Directors also highlight the importance of our 
corporate standards through participation in less 

formal settings, such as town hall and other meetings 

held by our lines of business and other functions for 

employees and/or leadership teams, annual meetings 

with the Firm™s senior leaders, and regularly scheduled 

informal sessions with members of the Firm™s Operating 

Committee and other senior leaders. For more 

information on the Firm™s corporate standards see ﬁOur 

business principlesﬂ on page 
32 of this proxy 
statement.
Shareholders and interested parties who wish to 
contact our Board of Directors, any Board member, 

including the Lead Independent Director, any 

committee chair, or the independent directors as a 

group, may mail their correspondence to: JPMorgan 

Chase & Co., Attention (name of Board member(s)), 

Office of the Secretary, 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 

10017, or e-mail the Office of the Secretary at 

corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCEThe Board™s commitment to independence begins with 

the individual directors. All of our non-management 

Board members are independent under the standards 

established by the NYSE and the Firm™s independence 

standards. Directors are determined to be independent 

if they have no disqualifying relationship, as defined by 

the NYSE, and if the Board has affirmatively 

determined they have no material relationship with 

JPMorgan Chase, directly or as a partner, shareholder 

or officer of an organization that has a relationship 

with JPMorgan Chase.
In determining the independence of each director, the 
Board uses the following criteria:
The Corporate Governance Principles adopted by 
the Board and published on our website at 
jpmorganchase.com, under the heading 
Governance, which is under the About Us tab
The NYSE corporate governance listing standards
The Board has reviewed the relationships between the 

Firm and each director and determined that in

director (Linda B. Bammann, James A. Bell, Crandall C. 

Bowles, Stephen B. Burke, James S. Crown, Timothy P. 

Flynn, Laban P. Jackson, Jr., Michael A. Neal, Lee R. 

Raymond and William C. Weldon) has only immaterial 

relationships with JPMorgan Chase. Accordingly, all 

directors other than Mr. Dimon are independent. 
Because of the nature and broad scope of the services 
provided by the Firm, there may be ordinary course of 

business transactions between the Firm and any 

independent director, his or her immediate family 

members or principal business affiliations. These may 

include, among other things, extensions of credit and 

other financial and financial advisory products and 

services; business transactions for property or services; 

and charitable contributions made by the JPMorgan 

Chase Foundation or the Firm to any nonprofit 

organization of which a director is employed as an 

officer. 
In making its determinations regarding director 
independence, the Board considered:
Consumer credit: extensions of credit provided to 
directors Bell and Jackson; and credit cards issued 

to directors Bammann, Bell, Bowles, Crown, Flynn, 

Jackson, Neal, Raymond, and Weldon, and their 

immediate family members
Wholesale credit: extensions of credit and other 

financial and financial advisory services provided to 

NBCUniversal, LLC and Comcast Corporation and 

their subsidiaries, for which Mr. Burke is Chief 

Executive Officer and a senior executive, 

respectively; and Henry Crown and Company, for 

which Mr. Crown is President, and other Crown 

family-owned entities
Goods and services: commercial office space leased 

by the Firm from subsidiaries of companies in which 

Mr. Crown and members of his immediate family 

have indirect ownership interests; and national 

media placements with NBCUniversal and Comcast 

outletsThe Board reviewed these relationships in light of its 

independence standards and determined that none of 

them creates a material relationship between the Firm 

and the applicable director or would impair the 

independence or judgment of the applicable director. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATIONThe Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing 

director compensation and making recommendations 

to the Board. In making its recommendation, the 

Governance Committee annually reviews the Board™s 

responsibilities and also the compensation practices of 

the firms in the peer groups used by the CMDC for 

benchmarking as part of assessing compensation 

practices and pay levels for Operating Committee 

members. For more information on these peer groups 

see ﬁEvaluating market practicesﬂ on page 46 of this 

proxy statement. In addition, the Board believes it is 

desirable that a significant portion of director 

compensation be linked to the Firm™s common stock. In 

2015, the Board determined that no changes should be 

made to director compensation.
Annual compensation
For 2015, each non-management director received an 

annual cash retainer of $75,000 and an annual grant, 

made when annual employee incentive compensation 

was paid, of deferred stock units valued at $225,000, 

on the date of grant. Additional cash compensation was 

paid for certain committees and other services as 

described on page 30 of this proxy statement.
Each deferred stock unit included in the annual grant to 
directors represents the right to receive one share of 

the Firm™s common stock and dividend equivalents 

payable in deferred stock units for any dividends paid. 

Deferred stock units have no voting rights. In January 

of the year immediately following a director™s 

termination of service, deferred stock units are 

distributed in shares of the Firm™s common stock in 

either a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 

15 years as elected by the director.

   31Stock ownership: no hedging, no pledging
As stated in the Corporate Governance Principles and 

further described in ﬁNo Hedging/Pledgingﬂ on page 64 

of this proxy statement, each director agrees to retain 

all shares of the Firm™s common stock he or she 

purchased on the open market or received pursuant to 

their service as a Board member for as long as they 

serve on our Board. 
Shares held personally by a director may not be held in 
margin accounts or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor 

may the economic risk of such shares be hedged. 
As detailed at page 75 of this proxy statement under 
ﬁSecurity ownership of directors and executive 

officers,ﬂ Mr. Crown has the ownership of certain 

shares attributed to him that arise from the business of 

Henry Crown and Company, an investment company 

where Mr. Crown serves as President, and trusts of 

which Mr. Crown serves as trustee (the ﬁAttributed 

Sharesﬂ). Mr. Crown disclaims beneficial ownership of 

such shares, except to the extent of his pecuniary 

interest. The Attributed Shares are distinct from shares 

Mr. Crown or his spouse own individually, or shares held 

in trusts for the benefit of his children (the ﬁCrown 

Personally Held Sharesﬂ). The Firm has reviewed the 

potential pledging of the Attributed Shares with Mr. 

Crown, recognizes Mr. Crown™s distinct obligations with 

respect to Henry Crown and Company and the trusts, 

and believes such shares may be prudently pledged or 

held in margin loan accounts. Crown Personally Held 

Shares are not and may not be held in margin accounts 

or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor may the 

economic risk of such shares be pledged.
Deferred compensation

Each year non-management directors may elect to 

defer all or part of their cash compensation. A 

director™s right to receive future payments under any 

deferred compensation arrangement is an unsecured 

claim against JPMorgan Chase™s general assets. Cash 

amounts may be deferred into various investment 

equivalents, including deferred stock units. Upon 

retirement, compensation deferred into stock units will 

be distributed in stock; all other deferred cash 

compensation will be distributed in cash. Deferred 

compensation will be distributed in either a lump sum 

or in annual installments for up to 15 years as elected 

by the director commencing in January of the year 

following the director™s retirement from the Board.
Reimbursements and insurance
The Firm reimburses directors for their expenses in 

connection with their Board service or pays such 

expenses directly. The Firm also pays the premiums on 

directors™ and officers™ liability insurance policies and 

on travel accident insurance policies covering directors 

as well as employees of the Firm.

Our business principles As a Firm we have worked to strengthen our corporate 
culture, including by rededicating ourselves to the 

Firm™s mission and business principles. We aligned our 

efforts under the ﬁHow We Do Businessﬂ framework 

and launched a global Culture and Conduct program 

focused on maintaining a strong corporate culture that 

instills and enhances a sense of personal accountability. 

As part of our efforts to continue to embed culture into 

our business-as-usual operating environment, the Firm 

has named senior executives to serve as the Executive 

Sponsors of the Culture and Conduct program on behalf 

of the Operating Committee. This executive sponsorship 

will help the program remain a business-driven key

It is important that corporate standards be clearly

Culture and Conduct program work, our Firm™s 

standards are documented in our Business Principles, 

Code of Conduct (ﬁCodeﬂ) and Code of Ethics for

Business Principles We have a clearly articulated set of 20 core business 

principles, representing four central corporate tenets: 

exceptional client service; operational excellence; a 

commitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility; 

and a great team and winning culture. The full set of 

Business Principles is included in our report ﬁHow We 

Do Business Š The Report,ﬂ which is posted on our 

website at jpmorganchase.com under the Investor 

Relations tab. These principles provide the road map 

for how all employees at JPMorgan Chase are expected 

to behave in their work and will continue to guide the 

Firm as we move forward.
Code of Conduct
The Code is our core conduct policy document and is 

designed to provide the direction for essential elements 

of the Business Principles road map. All new hires must 

complete Code training shortly after their start date 

with the Firm. All employees are required to complete 

additional Code training and provide a new affirmation
 
of their compliance with the Code annually. 
Employees can report any known or suspected 

violations of the Code via the Code Reporting Hotline by 

phone, web, e-mail, mail or fax. The Hotline is 

anonymous, except in certain non-US jurisdictions 

where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is 

available 24/7 globally, with translation services. It is 

maintained by an outside service provider to enhance 

employee confidentiality. 
We maintain country-specific whistleblower policies as 
appropriate, as well as firmwide human resources 

policies affording protection for the good faith 

reporting of concerns raised by employees. We also 

provide guidelines to employees in our Human 

Resources, Global Investigations and Legal departments 

regarding the review and treatment of employee-

initiated complaints, including the proper escalation of 

suspected or known violations of the Code, other Firm 

policy or the law. 
Suspected violations of the Code, Firm policy or the law 
are investigated by the Firm and may result in an 

employee being cleared of the suspected violation or 

an escalating range of actions depending upon the facts 

and circumstances. A Chief Compliance Officer and a 

Human Resources executive annually report to the 

Audit Committee on the Code of Conduct program and 

review the record of compliance.
Code of Ethics for Finance Professionals
The Code of Ethics for Finance Professionals applies to 

the CEO, CFO, Controller and all other professionals of 

the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, 

line of business treasury, tax or investor relations role. 

The purpose of our Code of Ethics is to promote honest 

and ethical conduct and compliance with the law in 

connection with the maintenance of the Firm™s financial 

books and records and the preparation of our financial 

statements.

   33Certain key governance policies
SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS ANDACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENTThe Firm™s By-laws permit shareholders holding at least 
20% of the outstanding shares (net of hedges) of our 

common stock to call special meetings. In addition, the 

Firm™s Certificate of Incorporation permits shareholders 

holding at least 20% of the outstanding shares of our 

common stock to act by written consent on terms 

substantially similar to the terms applicable to call 

special meetings.
PROXY ACCESSNew in 2016 - 
In January 2016, the Board amended 

the Firm™s By-laws by adding Section 1.10 to provide 

for a right of proxy access. This right enables eligible 

shareholders to include their nominees for election as 

directors in the Firm™s own proxy statement. The By-law 

amendment was adopted following extensive 

discussions with our shareholders and reflects their 

expressed desire to have additional access to the 

director nomination process. The terms of the proxy 

access By-law permit a shareholder to nominate up to 

20% of the Board (but in any event at least two 

directors) and include a shareholder ownership 

threshold requirement of 3% for at least 3 consecutive 

years. In addition, the By-law allows up to 20 

shareholders to form a group to reach the required 

threshold. The complete text of new By-law Section 

1.10 is available on our website at jpmorganchase.com, 

under the heading Governance, which is under the 

About Us tab.
PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENTOur business is subject to extensive laws and 

regulations at the international, federal, state and local 

levels. Changes in such laws can significantly affect how 

we operate, our revenues and the costs we incur. 

Because of the potential impact public policy can have 

on our businesses, employees, communities and 

customers, we engage in the political process regularly 

to advance and protect the long-term interests of the 

Firm. Information about our approach, policies and 

procedures regarding political and legislative activities 

is posted on our website at jpmorganchase.com/

policyengagement. 
Our political activities are subject to oversight by the 
Board™s Public Responsibility Committee, which 

provides guidance to the Board and management on 
significant policies and practices regarding political 

activities, including major lobbying priorities, and 

principal trade association memberships that relate to 

the Firm™s public policy objectives. The Global 

Government Relations department implements these 

policies and manages all political activities conducted 

by the Firm. The department reports to the Head of 
Corporate Responsibility and prepares an annual 
review for the Board™s Public Responsibility Committee. 
This leadership provides a continued focus on the 

public policy issues that are most relevant to the long-

term interests of our business, clients and 

shareholders.
Our policies prohibit contributions of corporate funds 
to candidates, political party committees or political 

action committees (ﬁPACsﬂ). Contributions by the Firm™s 

PACs are supported entirely by voluntary contributions 

made by employees and are used to support 

candidates, parties or committees whose views on 

specific issues are consistent with the Firm™s priorities. 

The Firm™s PACs contribute to candidates and political 

committees on a bi-partisan basis and do not make 

contributions in connection with U.S. presidential 

elections. Contributions made by the PACs are subject 

to legal disclosure requirements and are reported in 

filings with the Federal Election Commission and the 

relevant state or local election commissions, and are 

publicly available on our website. 
We may, from time to time, use corporate funds to 
support or oppose state or local ballot initiatives that 

affect our business. No corporate funds are used to 

make contributions to broad-based groups organized 

under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 

Firm™s PACs may make contributions to ballot 

committees and 527 groups; however, contributions to 

527s are primarily membership dues and are not used 

to support the election of any specific candidate or for 

the purpose of funding specific expenditures or 

communications. We voluntarily provide information 

about these contributions on our website at 

jpmorganchase.com/policyengagement.
We may occasionally support groups organized under 
Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code on 

public policy matters, but not for electoral purposes. 

When we do support such groups on public policy 

matters, we will seek to disclose that information.
We do not use corporate funds to make independent 
political expenditures, including electioneering 
communications. In addition, we restrict the trade 

associations to which we belong from using our funds 

for any election-related activity.

Proposal 2 Š Advisory resolution to approve executive compensation
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYAs discussed in the Compensation Discussion and 
Analysis section of the proxy statement on pages 

37-64, the Board of Directors believes that JPMorgan 

Chase™s long-term success as a premier financial 

services firm depends in large measure on the talents 

of our employees, and a proper alignment of their 

compensation with performance and sustained 

shareholder value. The Firm™s compensation system 

plays a significant role in our ability to attract, retain 

and properly motivate the highest quality workforce. 

The principal underpinnings of our compensation 

system are an acute focus on performance within a well 

controlled environment, shareholder alignment, 

sensitivity to the relevant marketplace, and a long-term 

orientation. 
ADVISORY RESOLUTIONAs required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange 

Act of 1934, as amended, this proposal seeks a 

shareholder advisory vote to approve the 

compensation of our Named Executive Officers as 

disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K 

through the following resolution:
ﬁResolved, that shareholders approve the Firm™s 
compensation practices and principles and their 

implementation for 2015 for the compensation of the 

Firm™s Named Executive Officers as discussed and 

disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and 

Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related 

material contained in this proxy statement.ﬂ
Because this is an advisory vote, it will not be binding 
upon the Board of Directors. However, the 

Compensation & Management Development Committee 

(ﬁCMDCﬂ) will take into account the outcome of the vote 

when considering future executive compensation 

arrangements. We will include an advisory vote on 

executive compensation on an annual basis at least 

until the next shareholder advisory vote on the 

frequency of such votes, to be held not later than 

2017.The Board of Directors recommends a vote
 FOR
 this advisory resolution to approve 
executive compensation.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe Firm has generated strong ROTCE while growing its capital base over a long-term horizon. Since 2008, the Firm 
has more than doubled its average tangible common equity (ﬁTCEﬂ) from $80 billion to $170 billion Š a compound 
annual growth rate of 11% and an increase of $90 billion. Over the same period, the Firm has generated nearly $140 
billion of cumulative net income and an average ROTCE of 12%. In 2015, the Firm generated ROTCE of 13%, flat to 
2014, but on $9 billion higher average TCE, which reflects higher net income, higher common dividends and higher 
share repurchases. The exhibit below sets forth our ROTCE and average TCE over the 2008Œ2015 period.
STRONG ROTCE ON INCREASING CAPITALThe Firm has also delivered consistently strong growth in both Tangible Book Value Per Share (ﬁTBVPSﬂ) and EPS over 
a sustained period of time. We increased our TBVPS from $22.52 to $48.13 Š an 11% compound annual growth rate 
from December 31, 2008, through December 31, 2015. Over the same period, we also substantially increased diluted 

EPS each year, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 24%. The exhibit below sets forth our TBVPS and EPS over 
the 2008Œ2015 period.SUSTAINED GROWTH IN BOTH TBVPS AND EPS40    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    2016 PROXY ST

illustrated in the exhibit, every $100 invested in JPMorgan Chase as of December 31, 2007 would be valued at $183 
as of December 31, 2015, significantly outperforming the financial services industry over the period, as measured by 
the S&P Financial Index and the KBW Bank Index. The exhibit below also shows our strong relative TSR performance 
over a one-year, three-year, and five-year period, relative to the S&P Financial Index and the KBW Bank Index.
SUSTAINED SHAREHOLDER VALUE (ﬁTSRﬂ)1 Total shareholder return (ﬁTSRﬂ) assumes reinvestment of dividends
2.  SUSTAINED PROGRESS IN REINFORCINGOUR CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND OURCULTUREBecause we believe that a strong and sustainable 
control environment is vital to minimizing legal, 

regulatory and control issues, it continues to be a 

priority for the Firm. We have continued to focus on 

addressing outstanding regulatory and litigation 

matters including, among others, those pertaining to 

the December 2015 resolution concerning written 

client disclosures, as well as other resolutions of 

investigations and/or litigation involving foreign 

exchange trading and losses suffered in 2012 by the 

Chief Investment Office. 
Since 2011, our total headcount associated with 
controls has gone from 24,000 people to 43,000 

people, and our total annual control spend has gone 

from $6 billion to approximately $9 billion over that 

same time period. We have more work to do, but a 

strong and permanent foundation is in place.
We have also implemented training and education 
programs that have touched all of our approximately 
235,000 employees throughout the Firm, working in 

more than 60 countries and nearly 2,100 U.S. cities. 
To enhance the Firm™s defense capabilities, we have 
increased cybersecurity spending from approximately 
$250 million in 2014 to approximately $500 million in 

2015, as there is no investment more important than 

protecting the data and assets of the Firm, and our 

customers and clients. Worldwide, thousands of 

employees are focused on cybersecurity 
Š working 
across the Firm and with many partners to maintain 

our defenses to enhance our resilience against cyber 

threats. 
Further Strengthening Our Culture 
Over the past few years, we have undertaken a 

significant effort to examine how we can more 

rigorously and consistently adhere to the high ethical 

standards that our shareholders, regulators and others 

expect of us and that we expect for ourselves. This 

includes clearly articulating business principles, 

promoting sound governance and the right tone from 

the top, having in place strong leadership and 

management processes, and providing a management 

development and compensation framework that 

properly incents appropriate behaviors. We have

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
continued to reinforce our Business Principles in order 
to support a culture that instills a sense of personal 

accountability through broad, deep integration of 

common standards across businesses and geographies. 

Taken together, these efforts represent our 

commitment to the Firm™s culture and reflect the long-

term approach we are taking to enhance it.  
Actions taken in 2015 included rolling out a global, 
firmwide Culture and Conduct Program, which 

leverages what we learned from a pilot program 

undertaken in the EMEA region and the Corporate & 

Investment Bank. We obtained feedback from 

thousands of employees via focus groups, surveys and 

polls, identified key themes and established actions, 

where appropriate. In addition, Conduct Risk 

Assessments were performed by each line of business 

and function, also with appropriate action items 

identified. 
We established explicit Board oversight of the Culture 
and Conduct program through the Compensation & 

Management Development Committee and rolled out a 

comprehensive suite of management training programs 

that embed culture and conduct throughout the Firm. 

So that the Culture and Conduct program remains a key 

business-driven priority for every line of business and 

function, the Firm has named senior executives to serve 

as the Executive Sponsors of the Culture and Conduct 

program on behalf of the Operating Committee. The 

program will be further enhanced by operational 

oversight from our Human Resources department.
In addition, we have focused our attention on 
embedding our standards throughout the employee life 

cycle, starting with the recruiting and onboarding 

process and extending to training, compensation, 

promoting and disciplining employees. 
3.  ENHANCING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE TODELIVER SUSTAINED PERFORMANCEOur performance reflects our commitment to invest in 

our businesses and further strengthen the market 

leadership of our franchises. We believe that our future 

success rests on our ability to continually improve upon 

our clients™ and customers™ experience. The following 

are examples of actions taken by our LOBs during 2015 

to enhance our clients™ and customers™ experience:
Consumer & Community Banking (ﬁCCBﬂ)
 Š We 

enhanced our customers™ digital experience by 

redesigning the Chase online home page to deliver a 

more personalized and user-friendly experience. We 

also added new functionality to our award-winning 

mobile app with Touch ID for the iPhone.  We™ve 

invested to provide simple, secure and personalized 

experiences for our customers through our Chase 

mobile app, Chase Quick Pay
SM and our announcement 
of Chase Pay.
Corporate & Investment Bank (ﬁCIBﬂ) Š
 We made 

major investments in electronic trading technology, 

particularly within the fixed income business; a good 

example is our enhancements to our FX trading 

capabilities on J.P. Morgan Markets, including mobile 

execution launched for FX spot and algorithmic 

execution tools. We also engaged with emerging 

financial technology companies to design and test next-

generation products. In addition, we are building out 

our Treasury Services and Paymentech products to 

offer our clients the ability to engage in foreign 

exchange transactions from any branch, through any 

channel, at any time through our ACCESS platform.
Commercial Banking (ﬁCBﬂ) 
Š We developed 

specialized industry group teams in our Commercial 

and Industrial client segment that have deep expertise 

in particular industries, including healthcare, life 

sciences, media and entertainment, energy, 

agribusiness and food, apparel and footwear, and 

technology. We are seeing early success with this 

segmented approach Œ in 2015, approximately 50% of 

our new Middle Market clients were in one of our 

specialized industry groups.
Asset Management (ﬁAMﬂ)
 Š We improved our client 

experience across several dimensions. In Global Wealth 

Management we developed a proprietary, goals-based 

investing tool and implemented more efficient client 

onboarding processes to reduce account opening time. 

In Global Investment Management we continued to 

deliver innovative products with 40 fund launches, and 

we published our ﬁGuide to the Marketsﬂ in 12 

languages and 25 countries to share our thought 

leadership globally. Digital wealth management, 

process reengineering, product innovation and 

intellectual capital helped us to continue to improve 

our service to institutional and individual clients in over 

130 countries around the world.

   434.  INVESTMENT IN OUR PEOPLEOur employees™ effectiveness, career development, and 
ability to adapt to a changing landscape are critical for 

us to continue to deliver sustained shareholder value. 

In addition, maintaining our corporate standards and 

strong financial performance for the long term requires 

a pipeline of high-caliber talent. We believe the most 

effective workforce is a diverse workforce, and as such, 

we maintain firmwide inclusion and diversity initiatives 

to attract and retain the highest quality talent. 
Employee development
From the moment employees join the Firm and 

throughout their careers, it is our responsibility to 

provide opportunities to help them build their 

knowledge, skills and experience. We spend 

approximately $300 million per year on learning 

programs. Programs range from entry-level to 

experienced skills to management, with courses 

tailored to individual functions, lines of business or 

geographic regions. 
Leadership development
Throughout the organization, we work to develop a 

steady pipeline of strong leaders through on the job 

experiences, learning and development programs and 

mobility opportunities.
In 2015, we enhanced the Firm™s learning and 
development initiatives by launching JPMorgan Chase™s 

Leadership Edge Š a firmwide suite of leadership and 

management learning programs rooted in the Firm™s 

Business Principles (see page 32 of this proxy 

statement). Leadership Edge is designed to help 

develop outstanding leaders at all levels of 

management across each line of business, function and 

region and strengthen our leadership culture.
Leadership Edge delivers training to managers and 
leaders at key transition points Œ from joining the Firm 

as a new-hire manager or becoming a first-time 

manager of others to managing large global teams. 

Internal certified faculty and senior line leaders deliver 

the programs to managers from across businesses, 

functions and regions.
This year, we opened our flagship facility dedicated to 
management and leadership learning Œ the Pierpont 

Leadership Center, in New York City. This dedicated 

facility provides an opportunity for our faculty and 

senior leaders to engage with managers at all levels 
and reinforce the importance of our leadership 

attributes.
JPMorgan Chase™s Leadership Edge is comprised of 9 
core programs:
Succession planning

Succession planning is a top priority for the Board and 

the Firm™s senior leadership, with the objective of 

having a pipeline of leaders for the immediate and long 

term future. To achieve this objective, the Board and 

management take a proactive approach. 
The CMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO 
followed by Board discussion led by the Lead 

Independent Director. The CMDC also reviews the 

succession plan for members of the Operating 

Committee other than the CEO, which is then discussed 

by the Board of Directors. These processes enable the 

Board to address both short-term unexpected events, 

as well as long-term, planned occurrences, such as 

retirement or change in roles.

Similar processes, led by the relevant management 
team, occur within each of the Firm™s lines of business 

and functions.
Diversity
Diversity and inclusion are important to the Firm. We 

are committed to a culture of openness and  

meritocracy, and believe in giving all individuals an 

opportunity to succeed while bringing their whole 

selves to work. Our diverse employee base and 

inclusive environment are strengths that lead to the 

best solutions for our customers and for every 

community that we serve. Our diversity and inclusion 

strategy has three pillars Œ Workforce, Workplace and 

Marketplace Œ with management accountability being 

critical to our ability to hire, train and retain great and 

diverse employees whose unique perspectives help us 

realize our business objectives.
We continue to invest significant time and effort toward 
our diversity and inclusion strategy, including 

expanding our diversity scholarship program, 

increasing marketing and events on college and 

university campuses, and leveraging and executing best 

practices more consistently firmwide. Our Business 

Resource Groups (ﬁBRGsﬂ) also encourage employees 

to use their unique perspectives to advance the Firm™s 

priorities in the global marketplace. One in every four 

employees is a BRG member. 
We also maintain diversity advisory councils that meet 
monthly to review the Firm™s progress toward our 

diversity objectives globally.
As part of our mission to hire top talent, we enhanced 
our firmwide campus recruiting process and improved 

the candidate experience by simplifying our offerings, 

providing efficient and cost effective online interview 

opportunities, and by arranging virtual events to reach 

broader users. We also refreshed our campus recruiting 

website to better communicate about opportunities 

offered by the Firm.
The Firm is committed to providing benefits programs 
and policies that support the needs of our employees 

and their families. Our incentives for wellness and 

healthy behaviors include free preventive screenings 

and 29 free onsite clinics. In 2015, we increased 

parental leave time in the U.S. from 12 weeks to 16 

weeks for the primary caregiver, and from one week to 

two weeks for the non-primary caregiver (effective 

January 1, 2016). Our benefits spending, directed 
more than proportionately to lower wage earners, 

includes higher insurance subsidies and greater 

retirement benefits, such as a competitive 401(k) 

dollar for dollar match on 5% of pay, as well as a 

special award to lower paid employees which we 

increased in 2015. We are also one of less than 20% of 

Fortune 500 companies that continue to offer a well-

funded defined benefit pension plan to employees.
As a founding member of the Veteran Jobs Mission, a 
coalition of approximately 220 employers that have 

collectively hired over 314,000 veterans and whose 

ultimate goal is to hire 1 million veterans, the Firm has 

hired more than 10,000 veterans since 2011, with 

48% of our 2015 veteran hires coming from diverse 

backgrounds. Additionally, we committed $14 million 

through 2020 to the Institute for Veterans and Military 

Families at Syracuse University; donated 113 mortgage 

free homes, valued at more than $20 million, to 

veterans and their families; and laid plans to support 

veteran-owned small businesses in 2016. We take pride 

in the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace Œ 

World™s Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine, 

America™s Ideal Employers by Universum, Best for Vets 

by Military Times, Best Employer for Healthy Lifestyles 

by the National Business Group on Health, Best 

Companies for Multicultural Women by Working Mother 

Magazine, and we are proud to have received a 100% 

rating on the Corporate Equality Index (14 consecutive 

years) and a 100% rating on the Disability Equality 

Index.
Accessibility
As part of our ongoing commitment to be an employer 

of choice, in 2015, we laid the foundation for the Office 

of Accessibility Affairs to increase the Firm™s focus on 

matters related to accessibility, including the 

Americans with Disability Act (ﬁADAﬂ). The Office of 

Accessibility Affairs will be responsible for partnering 

with senior management to identify opportunities to 

develop and drive engagement, policy and strategy for 

accessibility matters across the Firm, including 

collaboration with various departments such as 

Regulatory Capital Management, Risk Management, 

Technology, Real Estate and Human Resources.

make informed decisions
   Assessments of performance, over a multi-year period, against four broad performance categories that drive 
sustained shareholder value
   Adoption of PSU Program introduces a formulaic component in Operating Committee members™ compensation 
(i.e., number of PSUs earned at vest is based on formula), while maintaining risk and control features
PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORKThe CMDC reviews and approves the Firm™s 
compensation philosophy, which guides how the Firm™s 

compensation plans and programs are designed for the 

Operating Committee, as well as all other employees at 

the Firm.
The CMDC uses a disciplined pay-for-performance 
framework to make executive compensation decisions 

commensurate with the Firm, line of business (ﬁLOBﬂ), 

function, and individual performance, while considering 

other relevant factors, including market practices. 
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FACTORSIn determining Operating Committee members™ 

compensation, the CMDC uses a balanced approach to 

assess performance against four broad categories: 
1. Business and financial results
2. Risk and control objectives

3. Customer and client goals

4. People management and leadership objectives
These performance categories appropriately consider 
short-, medium- and long-term goals that drive 

sustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk 

and control objectives.
To promote a proper pay-for-performance alignment, 
the CMDC relies on its business judgment to determine 

appropriate compensation and does not assign relative 

weightings to these categories.
 In addition, feedback 

from the Firm™s risk and control professionals is 

considered in assessing Operating Committee 

members™ performance. The performance of Operating 

Committee members against these categories is 

discussed in detail on pages 52-56 of this proxy 

statement. 
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT PROCESSWe believe our balanced approach in assessing Firm, 
LOB, function, and individual performance enables the 

CMDC and the Board to make informed compensation 

decisions regarding our Operating Committee 

members. 
Our comprehensive performance review process 
includes the following key features:
The Board regularly reviews Firm and LOB budgets 
and business plansThe CEO and other Operating Committee members 

establish individual performance priorities, which are 

reviewed with the CMDC
Throughout the year, the Board and CMDC review 

Firm, LOB, function, and individual performance
All LOBs and regions conduct quarterly control 

forums to discuss any identified risks that may 

materially impact the Operating Committee 

members™ performance reviews and related 

compensation
Feedback from the Firm™s risk and control 

professionals 
In parallel with the performance review process, the 

CMDC engages in regular discussions with the CEO and 

the Director of Human Resources on Operating 

Committee members™ performance throughout the 

year. The CMDC believes that this proactive process (vs. 

determining pay levels during a single year-end 

process) results in pay decisions that are more 

commensurate with performance.

EVALUATING MARKET PRACTICESIn order to effectively attract, properly motivate and retain our senior executives, the CMDC regularly reviews 
market data relating to both pay levels and pay practices.
Given the diversity of the Firm™s businesses, the CMDC developed a set of peers that includes both Financial Services 
companies and General Industry companies. The Financial Services peers are comprised of large financial services 

companies with which the Firm directly competes, for both talent and business. The General Industry peers are 

comprised of large, global leaders across multiple industries. In evaluating market practices and pay levels for 

Operating Committee members, the CMDC uses market data from both peer groups, and considers the size of the 

firms and the nature of their businesses in using this data. 
Specific factors considered in determining companies for inclusion in the Firm™s peer groups include:
Financial services industry
Significant global presence
Global iconic brand
Industry leader
Comparable size
Recruits top talent
The table below sets forth the composition of our peer groups.
The CMDC also references other financial firms for comparison, including Barclays, BNY Mellon, BlackRock, Capital 
One Financial, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS. 
To illustrate the reasonableness of the CMDC™s peer selection, the following table provides a summary of the 
financial attributes of our Financial Services and General Industry peers, and our relative positioning based on these 

attributes.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   47DETERMINING PAY LEVELSIn determining total compensation levels for Operating 
Committee members, the CMDC considers the following 

factors in an effort to make pay commensurate with 

sustained performance, and to attract and retain top 

talent:
Performance, including risk and control objectives, 
as detailed above
Value of the position to the organization and 

shareholders over time (i.e., ﬁvalue of seatﬂ)
Leadership, including setting an example for others 

by acting with integrity and strengthening our 

culture
External talent market (i.e., market data)
Internal equity among Operating Committee 

members, as appropriate
While market data provides the CMDC with useful 

information regarding our competitors, the CMDC 

does not target specific positioning (e.g., 50
th percentile), nor does it use a formulaic approach in 

determining competitive pay levels. Instead, the CMDC 

uses a range of data as a reference, which is considered 

in the context of each executive™s performance over a 

multi-year period, as well as the value the individual 

delivers to the Firm. In addition, since the Firm rotates 

some of its executive officers among the leadership 

positions of its businesses and key functions as part of 

development and succession planning, and considers 

each Operating Committee member to be a part of the 

Firm's leadership beyond his or her discreet line of 

business or function responsibilities, the CMDC also 

places importance on the internal pay relationships 

among members of the Operating Committee.
DETERMINING PAY MIXOnce the CMDC determines Operating Committee 

members' total incentive compensation, the CMDC then 

establishes the appropriate mix between annual cash 

incentives and long-term equity (including PSUs and 

RSUs). For Mr. Dimon, the CMDC deferred 80% of his 

incentive compensation in PSUs (with the remaining 

20% in cash incentives) in order to more closely align 

his interest with those of shareholders. PSUs are 100% 

at risk, and will result in no payout unless a threshold 

performance level is achieved. For the remaining 

Operating Committee members, the CMDC deferred 

60% of Operating Committee members' incentive 

compensation into long-term equity (30% in PSUs and 

30% in RSUs), with the remaining 40% paid in cash 

incentives. The CMDC believes that this 60% equity/ 

40% cash mix encourages Operating Committee 

members to focus on the long-term success of the Firm 

while avoiding excessive risk-taking, and provides a 

competitive annual cash incentive opportunity. 
FORMULA USED IN DETERMINING ULTIMATENUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS
EARNED AT VESTINGIn January 2016, the CMDC approved a new long-term 
incentive compensation program Œ Performance Share 

Units (ﬁPSUsﬂ), which introduces a formula-based 

component into the determination of the level of 

compensation ultimately received by Operating 

Committee members. 
Specifically, while the grant 

value of PSUs is based on our discretionary approach 

in assessing performance, the ultimate number of 

PSUs earned at vesting is based on a formula using 

absolute and relative ROTCE performance, with the 

value of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%.
  
Awards are made only if the Board concludes they are 

appropriate based on all performance considerations, 

including risk and control. PSUs are also subject to risk 

and control features, including cancellation based on 

protection based vesting, as well as recovery pursuant 

to our clawback provision. Additional details on the 

PSUs are provided on page 49 of this proxy statement.

MR. DIMON™S 2015 COMPENSATION REFLECTS EXCEPTIONAL MULTI-YEAR PERFORMANCEThe Board™s decision to award Mr. Dimon annual compensation of $27.0 million (vs. $20.0 million in 2014) reflects his 
exceptional performance over a sustained period of time, including outstanding performance in 2015. The Firm delivered 

record net income and record EPS, and generated ROTCE of 13% in 2015, all while exceeding capital and expense targets, 
adapting and streamlining the business, and further strengthening and optimizing our fortress balance sheet. 
The Board recognized the Firm™s exceptional financial performance in the most recent 6 years since the financial crisis:
Strong annual ROTCE on increasing levels of capital 
(13% ROTCE or higher in 5 of the last 6 years); 
Record Net Income
 (5 of the last 6 years);
Record EPS
 (4 of the last 6 years); and 
Strong TBVPS growth rate of 10% 
(compounded annually over the last 6 years)
Concurrent with delivering outstanding financial results, Mr. Dimon has led a multi-year effort to fortify our controls, 
which includes addressing issues that resulted in supervisory and enforcement actions, as well as 
reinforcing our Firm™s 
culture by embedding our corporate standards throughout the employee life cycle
. These enhancements have
 culminated in a more effective and efficient control environment.
Mr. Dimon has also facilitated the market leadership of our four franchises, through significant investments in product 
innovation and leading edge technologies, which has continuously enhanced our customers™ experiences. Furthermore, 

Mr. Dimon led a significant effort towards investing in our people, enhancing diversity programs, building a pipeline of 
leaders, and developing outstanding talent across the organization.
Finally, in assessing Mr. Dimon™s performance and 
determining his pay, the CMDC and independent members 
of our Board also considered CEO pay for our financial 
services peers over multiple years as a reference. 
The exhibit to the right illustrates the reasonableness of 

Mr. Dimon™s compensation relative to these peers (based 
on three-year average total compensation), particularly in 
light of the Firm™s strong absolute and relative 
performance over multiple years.
Prior 3-Year Average CEO Total Compensation (
2012Œ2014)1 1 Total compensation is comprised of base salary, actual cash bonus paid in connection with the performance year, and long-term incentive compensation, including 
cash and equity-settled awards (the target value of long-term incentives awarded in connection with the performance year). The most recently used compensation 
data is 2014 since not all of our Financial Services peers will have filed their proxy statements before the preparation of our own proxy statement. Source: Proxy

 Interpreting 2015 NEO compensation
The table above is presented to show how the CMDC and Board viewed compensation awarded for 2015. It differs 

from how compensation is reported in the SCT on page 66, which is required by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (ﬁSECﬂ), and is not a substitute for the information required by the SCT. There are two principal 

differences between the SCT and the table above:
1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance year is completed. In both 
the table above and the SCT, cash incentive compensation paid in 2016 for 2015 performance is shown as 
2015 compensation. The table above treats equity awards (restricted stock units and performance share 

units) similarly, so that equity awards granted in 2016 for 2015 performance are shown as 2015 

compensation. The SCT reports the value of equity awards in the year in which they are made. As a result, 

awards granted in 2015 for 2014 performance are shown in the SCT as 2015 compensation.
2. The SCT reports the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation and all other 
compensation. These amounts are not shown above.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
PAY PRACTICES SUPPORT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS  Sound compensation philosophy drives compensation program and related decision-making at every level of the Firm
  Executives do not receive any special benefits, special severance, golden parachutes, or guaranteed bonuses
  Strong stock ownership guidelines and retention requirements create long-term alignment with shareholders
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHYOur compensation philosophy provides guiding principles that drive compensation-related decision-making across 
all levels of the Firm. We believe that a well-established and clearly communicated compensation philosophy drives 

fairness and consistency across the Firm. The table below sets forth a summary of our compensation philosophy. 
KEY TENETS OF COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHYTying pay to
performance andaligning withshareholders™ interests  In making compensation related decisions, we focus on long-term, risk-adjusted performance 
(including assessment of performance by the Firm™s risk and control professionals) and reward 
behaviors that generate sustained value for the Firm. This means compensation should not be 
overly formulaic, rigid or focused on the short term.
  A majority of NEO incentive compensation should be in equity that vests over multiple years.
Encouraging a sharedsuccess culture  Teamwork should be encouraged and rewarded to foster a ﬁshared successﬂ culture.
  Contributions should be considered across the Firm, within business units, and at an individual 
level when evaluating an employee™s performance.
Attracting and
retaining top talent  Our long-term success depends on the talents of our employees. Our compensation system plays 
a significant role in our ability to attract, properly motivate and retain top talent.
  Competitive and reasonable compensation should help attract and retain the best talent to grow 
and sustain our business.Integrating risk
management andcompensation  Risk management, compensation recovery, and repayment policies should be robust and 
disciplined enough to deter excessive risk-taking.
  HR control forums should generate honest, fair and objective evaluations and identify 
individuals responsible for meaningful risk-related events and their accountability.
  Recoupment policies include recovery of cash and equity compensation.
  Our pay practices must comply with applicable rules and regulations, both in the U.S. and 
worldwide.
No special perquisitesand non-performancebased compensation  Compensation should be straightforward and consist primarily of cash and equity incentives.
  We do not have special supplemental retirement or other special benefits just for executives, nor 
do we have any change in control agreements, golden parachutes, merger bonuses, or other 
special severance benefit arrangements for executives.
Maintaining stronggovernance  Our CMDC is comprised entirely of independent directors.  We believe independent director 
oversight of the Firm™s compensation practices and principles and their implementation fosters 
proper governance and regulatory compliance.
  The CMDC defines the Firm™s compensation philosophy, reviews and approves the Firm™s overall 
incentive compensation pools, and approves compensation for our Operating Committee, 
including the terms of compensation awards; CEO compensation is subject to Board ratification.
Transparency withshareholders  We
 believe that transparency to shareholders relating to our executive compensation program is 
essential. In order to provide shareholders with enough information and context to assess our 
program and practices, and their effectiveness, we disclose all material terms of our executive 
pay program, and any actions on our part in response to significant events, as appropriate.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.   
   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   59PAY PRACTICES ARE ALIGNED WITH COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHYWe believe the effectiveness of our compensation program is dependent upon the alignment of our pay practices 
with our compensation philosophy. The table below illustrates this strong alignment and further underscores our 

commitment to maintaining an executive compensation program  that is consistent with best practice. 
STRONG ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS (WHAT WE DO)Compensation philosophy
We believe our compensation philosophy promotes a best 
practice approach to compensation, including: (i) tying 
pay to performance and aligning with shareholder 
interests; (ii) attracting, retaining, and properly 
motivating top talent; (iii) integrating risk with 
compensation; (iv) maintaining strong governance; and 

(v) transparency.
Hedging/pledging policy

Operating Committee members and directors are 
prohibited from any hedging or pledging of our shares, 
including: short sales; unvested RSUs/PSUs; unexercised 
options or stock appreciation rights (ﬁSARsﬂ); and 
hedging of any shares personally owned outright or 
through deferred compensation.
Pay at risk
The majority of Operating Committee compensation is 
ﬁat-riskﬂ and contingent on achievement of business goals 
that are integrally linked to shareholder value and safety 
and soundness.Strong clawback policy
Comprehensive recovery provisions enable us to cancel or 
reduce unvested awards, or require repayment of cash or 
equity compensation already paid. In 2015, the CMDC 
adopted a mandatory disclosure policy for clawbacks 
taken against any of the Firm™s Operating Committee 

Members or the Firm™s Corporate Controller.
Majority of variable compensation in deferred equity
The majority of Operating Committee members™ variable 
compensation is deferred in JPMorgan Chase common 
stock (in the form of PSUs and RSUs) that vests over a 
3-year period. Value of equity at vesting is based on stock 
price at that time (in addition to achievement against pre-
established goals for PSUs). 
Competitive benchmarking
To make informed decisions on pay levels and pay 
practices, we benchmark ourselves against our peer 
groups. We believe external market data is an important 
component of maintaining pay practices that will attract 
and retain top talent, while driving shareholder value.
Risk events impact pay
In making pay decisions, we consider material risk and 
control issues, at both the Firm and line-of-business 
levels, and make adjustments to compensation, when 
appropriate.
Responsible use of equity
We manage our equity program responsibly, using only 
approximately 1% of weighted average diluted shares in 
2015. In addition, our share buyback program 

significantly reduces shareholder dilution.
Strong share ownership guidelines
Operating Committee members, including NEOs, are 

required to own a minimum of 200,000 to 400,000 
shares of our common stock; the CEO must own a 
minimum of 1,000,000 shares.
Shareholder outreach 
Each year, we solicit feedback from our shareholders on 
our compensation programs and practices. The CMDC 
considers this feedback when making compensation 
decisions.SOUND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES (WHAT WE DON™T DO)No golden parachute agreements
We do not provide additional payments or benefits in 
connection with a change-in-control event.
No guaranteed bonuses

We do not provide guaranteed bonuses, except for select 
individuals at hire, for one year
No special severance
We do not provide special severance. All employees, 
including NEOs, participate at the same level of 
severance, based on years of service, capped at 52 weeks 
up to a maximum credited salary.
No special executive benefits

- No private club dues, financial planning or tax 
   gross-ups for benefits
- No special health or medical benefits- No 401(k) Savings Plan matching contribution
- No special pension credits

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND RETENTION REQUIREMENTSOperating Committee members, including our NEOs, 
are subject to both ownership guidelines and holding 

requirements. 
Ownership Guidelines
While on the Operating Committee, each member is 

required to own a minimum of between 200,000 to 

400,000 shares of the Firm™s common stock, with the 

CEO required to own a minimum of 1,000,000 shares.  

Shares that count toward the required ownership levels 

include shares owned outright and 50% of unvested 

RSUs and PSUs (but do not include stock options or 
stock appreciation rights). Operating Committee 

members have six years from the effective date of the 

policy (or, if later, their date of appointment to the 

Operating Committee) to meet their required 

ownership guideline.
Retention Requirements
In addition to the ownership guidelines, Operating 

Committee members are required to hold 75% of the 

net shares they receive from awards, until they achieve 
their respective ownership guideline, and 50% 

thereafter (75% for the CEO). This policy is designed to 

increase share ownership above required levels for 

long-tenured members of our Operating Committee, 

thus further aligning their interests with those of 

shareholders. The policy was updated in 2015 to clarify 

that the retention requirements do not apply to shares 

received in connection with employment pre-dating 

appointment to the Operating Committee (applicable 

only to executives who joined the Operating Committee 

in 2013 or later). Any exceptions are subject to 

approval by the General Counsel. 
Mr. Dimon not only complies with all of these 
ownership guidelines and retention requirements, but 

has not sold a single share of JPMorgan Chase common 

stock or, prior to the merger, Bank One Corporation 

common stock, whether acquired as part of his 

compensation or on the open market, since he became 

CEO of Bank One in March of 2000.  
Our Retention Requirements Create Strong Alignment with Shareholders
1   Share ownership includes shares owned outright + 50% of unvested RSUs and PSUs.
2   Assumes individual has achieved minimum ownership requirement of 300K shares, otherwise must retain 75% of shares vesting (37.5K shares).

  Active engagement, transparency and assessments of risk and control issues by control function heads, leaders 
and subject matter experts across the Firm
  Cancellation and clawback provisions cover all forms of incentive compensation combined with formal and 
disciplined processes for review and determinations
 New for 2015, Board approved clawback disclosure policy to further enhance our transparency 
GOVERNANCE PROCESSThe CMDC oversees our firmwide compensation 
programs. Key responsibilities of the CMDC relating to 

compensation include:    
Defining the Firm™s compensation philosophy
Reviewing and approving overall incentive 
compensation pools (including percentage paid in 

equity/cash)
Reviewing and approving compensation for our 

Operating Committee and, for the CEO, making a 

recommendation to the Board for consideration and 

ratification by the independent directors
Reviewing and approving the terms of compensation 

awards, including recovery/clawback provisions
Reviewing the Firm™s compensation practices as they 

relate to risk and control (including the avoidance of 

practices that could encourage imprudent and 

excessive risk taking) 
Adopting pay practices that comply with applicable 

rules and regulations, both in the U.S. and worldwide
Approving the formula, pool calculation and 

performance goals for the shareholder approved Key 

Executive Performance Plan (ﬁKEPPﬂ) as required by 

Section 162(m)(1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
The CMDC performs the aforementioned roles on an 

ongoing basis so that our compensation program is 

proactive in addressing both current and emerging 

challenges. In addition, we have Control Forums 

facilitated by Human Resources at the Firm, line of 

business and regional levels (ﬁHR Control Forumsﬂ), the 

outcomes of which are factored into our compensation 

decisions. These processes are further discussed below.
RISK & CONTROL REVIEW PROCESSOur executive compensation program is designed to 

hold executives accountable, when appropriate, for 

meaningful actions or issues that negatively impact 

business performance in current or future years. 
The Firm conducts reviews through HR Control Forums 
to discuss meaningful risk and control issues that may 

have surfaced in other committees (e.g., Risk 

Committees and Business Control Committees), and 

review potential individual accountability and discuss 

any attendant group, people or proposed compensation 

pool impact. HR Control Forums are conducted on a 

quarterly basis in a number of regions and at various 

levels of the Firm and geographies including:
Line of Business/Corporate Control Forums 
Š Each line of business (ﬁLOBﬂ) and Corporate reviews 

meaningful risk and control issues related to its 

specific line of business and firmwide that may have 

potential individual or group accountability. 
Regional Control Forums
 Š Issues that arise in a 
given geography (both within and across LOBs/

Corporate) are also identified and assessed in 

Regional Control Forum meetings. Issues are referred 

to LOB/Corporate forums or escalated to the 

firmwide forums, as appropriate. 
Firmwide Control Forums
 Š Aggregate findings, 

including actions recommended or taken by LOB, 

Corporate, and Regional Forums, are reviewed and 

the CMDC is provided a summary of overall items and 

receives more detailed information on significant 

items.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    2016 PROXY ST

Performance management reviews for Designated 
Employees
 In addition to the HR Control Forums, the Firm also 
conducts performance management reviews for all 

material risk takers (including Operating Committee 

members), identified under Federal Reserve and/or 

European Union standards Š a group we refer to as 

ﬁDesignated Employees.ﬂ We solicit feedback directly 

from the Firm™s risk and control professionals who 

independently assess employees™ risk and control 

behavior. This feedback is used to assess whether our 

Designated Employees are meeting our risk/control 

behavior expectations and to hold individuals 

accountable for this aspect of their performance. The 

feedback from the risk and control process is critical in 

helping to identify individuals responsible for 

significant risk and control behavior or conduct issues, 

supervisory issues (e.g., failure to supervise, anticipate 

a material issue, or take appropriate action when the 

issue arose), and other risk and control related issues 

that impact the Firm. This input is used in managers™ 

evaluations of Designated Employees™ performance and 

is considered in determining annual compensation, and 

when appropriate, any recovery or clawback actions 

taken by the Firm. Components of the independent risk 

and control evaluation apply to over 15,000 employees 

of the Firm in an effort to more formally assess risk and 

control behaviors. We also conduct online training for 

risk and control reviewers and training for managers in 

order to further strengthen the process.
 HOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLETo hold individuals responsible for taking risks 

inconsistent with the Firm™s risk appetite and to 

discourage future imprudent behavior, the Firm has 

policies and procedures that enable us to take prompt 

and proportionate actions with respect to accountable 

individuals including:
1. Reduction of annual incentive compensation (in full 
or in part);
2. Cancellation of unvested awards (in full or in part);

3. Recovery of previously paid compensation (cash 
and/or equity); and
4. Taking appropriate employment actions (e.g., 
termination of employment, demotion, negative 
performance rating).
The precise actions we take with respect to accountable 

individuals are based on the nature of their 

involvement, the magnitude of the event and the 

impact on the Firm. A description of our recovery 

provisions (#2 and #3 above) is provided in the 

following section. 
CLAWBACK/RECOVERY PROVISIONSWe maintain clawback/recoupment provisions on both 

cash incentives and equity awards, which enable us to 

reduce or cancel unvested awards and recover 

previously paid compensation in certain situations. 

Incentive awards are intended and expected to vest 

according to their terms, but strong recovery provisions 

permit recovery of incentive compensation awards in 

appropriate circumstances. The following table 

provides details on the clawback provisions that apply 

to our Operating Committee Members and the Firm™s 

Corporate Controller (including the NEOs).
In 2015, the CMDC formally adopted a clawback 
disclosure policy that requires the Firm to disclose 

whether or not there has been any recoupment or 

recovery of previously paid compensation from a senior 

executive, so long as the underlying event has already 

been publicly disclosed in an SEC filing or similar public 

communication. During 2015, we did not take any 

actions to recover or clawback any incentive 

compensation from an Operating Committee member 

or the Firm™s Corporate Controller.

   631  Unexercisable SARs may be cancelled or deferred if the CEO determines that such action is appropriate based on a set of determination factors, including net 
income, net revenue, return on equity, earnings per share and capital ratios of the Firm, both on an absolute basis and, as appropriate, relative to peer firms.
2  Provisions apply to PSUs and to RSUs granted in 2012 and after to members of the Operating Committee and may result in cancellation of up to a total of 50% of 
the award.
UK clawback provisions
The Prudential Regulation Authority (ﬁPRAﬂ) and Financial Conduct Authority (ﬁFCAﬂ) require that discretionary 
incentive compensation awards made by regulated firms to certain employees identified under local regulations as 

material risk takers ("Identified Staff"), including Mr. Pinto, are subject to potential clawback/recovery for a 

minimum period of seven years following the date of the award.  
In accordance with these rules, the Firm has a Clawback Policy for relevant Identified Staff that enables us to cancel 
and/or recover incentive compensation in certain circumstances, including when: (1) an individual participated in or 

was responsible for conduct which resulted in significant loss(es) to the Firm; (2) an individual failed to meet 

appropriate standards of fitness and propriety set down by the FCA and/or PRA for regulatory purposes; (3) there is 

reasonable evidence of misbehavior or misconduct, or material error that would justify, or would have justified, 

termination of employment for cause; and/or (4) any LOB in which the individual is employed (or for which the 

individual is responsible) suffers a material failure of risk management by reference to the Firm™s risk management 

standards. 
Incentive compensation awards made to relevant Identified Staff on or after January 1, 2015, including Mr. Pinto™s 
incentive compensation awards in January 2016, are subject to the aforementioned Clawback Policy in addition to 

the recovery provisions in the table above.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
UK Individual Accountability Regime
The PRA and the FCA have introduced a new Individual 
Accountability Regime for certain UK regulated firms, 

which includes Senior Manager and Certification 

Regimes.
Under the Senior Manager Regime, firms are required 
to seek approval for employees (and senior non-

executives) to hold certain senior management 

functions. Those ﬁsenior managersﬂ are then subject to 

a statutory duty to demonstrate that they took 

reasonable steps to prevent or address regulatory 

issues, with the possibility of criminal and civil 

sanctions if they failed to do so. Under the Certification 

Regime, employees with a greater number of roles 

must be internally certified by the Firm as fit and 

proper to undertake that role.
Both Regimes require firms to undertake ongoing 
assessment of the fitness and propriety of the in scope 

employees, impose prescribed Conduct Rules on those 

individuals, and introduce referencing and reporting 

requirements.
RECOVERY PROCEDURESIssues that may require recovery determinations can be 
raised at any time, including in meetings of the Firm™s 

risk committees, HR Control Forums, annual 

assessments of employee performance and when 

material risk-takers resign or their employment is 

terminated by the Firm. Our well-defined process to 

govern these determinations is as follows:
A formal compensation review would occur following 
a determination that the cause and materiality of a 

risk-related loss, issue or other set of facts and 

circumstances warranted such a review. 
 The CMDC is responsible for determinations involving 

Operating Committee members (determinations 

involving the CEO are subject to ratification by 

independent members of the Board). The CMDC has 

delegated authority for determinations involving 

other employees to the Head of Human Resources, 

who facilitates determinations involving all other 

employees based on reviews and recommendations 

made by a committee generally comprised of the 

Firm™s senior Risk, Human Resources, Legal, 

Compliance, Audit and Financial officers and the 

Chief Executive Officer of the line of business for 

which the review was undertaken.
INTEGRATING RISK WITH THE COMPENSATIONFRAMEWORKTo encourage a culture of risk awareness and personal 
accountability, we approach our incentive 

compensation arrangements through an integrated 

risk, finance, compensation and performance 

management framework. Employee conduct that gives 

rise to risks that may impact the Firm™s performance in 

either the current year or future years are considered 

by the CMDC in determining bonus pools. In addition, 

significant governmental and regulatory actions 

ordinarily have a negative impact on relevant incentive 

compensation pools insofar as the determination of 

such pools, while not formulaic, involves consideration 

of financial performance (including settlement 

payments and fines), as well as risk and control issues. 

Matters that have been considered in the determination 

of incentive compensation pools in recent years 

include, among others, the December 2015 resolution 

between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 

and certain of the Firm™s subsidiaries concerning 

written client disclosures, as well as resolutions of 

investigations and/or litigation involving foreign 

exchange trading and losses suffered in 2012 by the 

Chief Investment Office.
NO HEDGING/PLEDGINGAll employees are prohibited from the hedging of 

unvested restricted stock units and performance share 

units, and unexercised options or stock appreciation 

rights. In addition:
The hedging by an Operating Committee member of 
any shares owned outright or through deferred 

compensation is prohibited 
Shares held directly by an Operating Committee 

member or director may not be held in margin 

accounts or otherwise pledged

1 Salary reflects the actual amount paid in each year.
2 Includes amounts awarded, whether paid or deferred. Cash incentive compensation reflects compensation earned in connection to 
performance year 2015, which was awarded in January 2016.
3 Includes amounts awarded during the year shown. Amounts are the fair value on the grant date (or, if no grant date was established, on the 
award date). The Firm™s accounting for employee stock-based incentives (including assumptions used to value employee stock options and 
SARs) that have been granted is described in Note 10 to the Firm™s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Report on pages 
231-232. Our Annual Report may be accessed on our website at jpmorganchase.com, under Investor Relations.
4 Amounts for years 2015 and 2014 are the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefits under all defined 
benefit and actuarial pension plans (including supplemental plans). For 2015, Ms. Erdoes had a reduction in pension value in the amount of 

$(8,563); for 2013, the NEOs, other than Ms. Lake and Mr. Pinto, had a reduction in pension value: Mr. Dimon, $(13,930), Ms. Erdoes, 

$(35,281) and Mr. Zames, $(5,625), respectively. Amounts shown also include earnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate on 

deferred compensation balances where the rate of return is not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical 
investments available under the Firm™s qualified plans. For Mr. Pinto this amount is $875 for 2015, $0 for 2014, and $136 for 2013 and for 
all other NEOs, this amount was $0 for each of 2015, 2014, and 2013.
5 Mr. Dimon™s 2015 compensation is reported lower in the SCT ($18.2 million) than in the annual compensation table on page 57 ($27.0 

million) due to a change in his year-over-year pay mix resulting in a significant portion of his performance-based pay for 2015 being delivered 
in equity. Specifically, for performance year 2015, a significant portion of Mr. Dimon™s compensation (approximately $20.5 million) was 
delivered in performance share units, which will be reported, in full, in the 2016 SCT (as they were granted in January 2016).  A portion of 
Mr. Dimon™s performance year 2015 compensation was not awarded in equity ($5 million was awarded in the form of a cash incentive), and is 
therefore included in the 2015 SCT. Pursuant to SEC rules, equity received for performance year 2014 ($11.1 million), which was granted in 
January 2015, is included in the 2015 SCT.  
6 The ﬁAll other compensationﬂ column for Mr. Dimon includes: $123,873 for personal use of corporate aircraft; $34,828 for personal use of 
cars; $462,264 for the cost of residential and related security paid by the Firm, the majority of which was one-time expenditures and are not 
expected to recur in 2016; and $95 for the cost of life insurance premiums paid by the Firm (for basic life insurance coverage equal to one 

times salary up to a maximum of $100,000, which program covers all benefit-eligible employees). Mr. Dimon™s personal use of corporate 

aircraft and cars, and certain related security, is required pursuant to security measures approved by the Board.

   67Incremental costs are determined as follows:
Aircraft: operating cost per flight hour for the aircraft type used, developed by an independent reference source, including fuel, fuel 
additives and lubricants; landing and parking fees; crew expenses; small supplies and catering; maintenance, labor and parts; engine 
restoration costs; and a maintenance service plan.
Cars: annual lease valuation of the assigned cars; annual insurance premiums; fuel expense; estimated annual maintenance; other 
miscellaneous expense; and annual drivers™ compensation, including salary, overtime, benefits and bonus. The resulting total is allocated 
between personal and business use based on mileage.
7. The ﬁAll other compensationﬂ column for Ms. Lake includes $26,032 in employer contributions to a non-U.S. defined contribution plan and 

$86,318 for tax settlement payments made on behalf of Ms. Lake in connection with her international assignment at the Firm™s request and 

consistent with the Firm™s policy for employees working on international assignments. The Firm™s expatriate assignment policy provides that 

the Firm will be responsible for any incremental U.S. and state income taxes due on home-country employer-provided benefits that would not 

otherwise be taxable to the employee in their home country.
8. Since Mr. Pinto is located in London, the terms and composition of his compensation reflect the requirements of local regulations, including 

changes that came into effect in 2014 to comply with the Capital Requirements Directive IV. These requirements include that at least 60% of 
his incentive compensation is deferred, and that his incentive compensation is not more than twice his fixed compensation in respect of any 
given performance year. Mr. Pinto™s fixed compensation is comprised of salary and a cash fixed allowance payable bi-annually and on account 
of his role and responsibilities. The CMDC elected to defer 100% of Mr. Pinto™s variable compensation into deferred equity - 50% into RSUs 
and 50% into PSUs - in order to maintain a comparable deferred equity portion as similarly situated Firm employees. Mr. Pinto™s salary and 

cash fixed allowance are denominated and paid in Sterling (GBP) and are unchanged from 2014 to 2015. For the purposes of this table, a 
blended applicable spot rate of 1.53851 U.S. dollars per pound sterling, which was based on a 10-month average spot rate has been used to 

convert Mr. Pinto™s salary to U.S. dollars for 2015; the fixed allowance was converted to U.S. dollars at 1.55800 and 1.53808 U.S. dollars per 
pound sterling for July 2015 and January 2016, respectively, based on 5-day average spot rates in July and October 2015, respectively. The 
blended applicable spot rates used to convert Mr. Pinto™s salary and fixed allowance for 2014 and his salary for 2013 were 1.66647 and 
1.56514 U.S. dollars per pound sterling, respectively.
9. The ﬁAll other compensationﬂ column for Mr. Pinto includes $21,693 in employer contributions to a non-U.S. defined contribution plan; 
$9,050 in tax compliance assistance for non-U.K. business travel; $18,781 for personal use of cars; $35,467 for spousal travel related to 

business events; and $120,637 for interest accrued on balances from mandatory bonus deferrals prior to 2016. During 2015, the applicable 
rate of interest on mandatory deferral balances was 1.60% for the first six months and 1.86% for the last six months of 2015.

1 Equity grants are awarded as part of the annual compensation process and as part of employment offers for new hires. In each case, the grant 

price is not less than the average of the high and the low prices of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the grant date. Grants made as part of 
the annual compensation process are generally awarded in January after earnings are released. RSUs carry no voting rights; however, 
dividend equivalents are paid on the RSUs at the time actual dividends are paid on shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock. The Firm does 
not grant options with restoration rights and prohibits repricing of stock options and SARs. 
On January 19, 2016, the Firm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of the 2015 annual incentive compensation. Because these awards were 
granted in 2016, they do not appear in this table, which is required to include only equity awards actually granted during 2015. These 2016 
awards are however reflected in the ﬁ2015 Named Executive Officer Compensationﬂ table on page 57 of this proxy statement. No SARs were 
awarded in 2016, 2015 or 2014 with respect to 2015, 2014 and 2013 compensation, respectively.
2 For all Named Executive Officers, the RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 13, 2017 and 2018. Under rules applicable in the U.K., 
for Mr. Pinto, these RSUs are subject to a six-month holding period post-vesting. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of 

common stock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in cash, equal to any dividends paid on the Firm™s 

common stock during the vesting period.

1 The awards set forth in the table have the following vesting schedules:
a In January 2008, the Firm awarded to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer up to 2 million SARs. The terms of this award are distinct 
from, and more restrictive than, other equity grants regularly awarded by the Firm. On July 15, 2014, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee and Board of Directors determined that all requirements for the vesting of the 2 million SAR awards had been met 
and thus, the awards became exercisable. The SARs, which will expire in January 2018, have an exercise price of $39.83 (the price of 

JPMorgan Chase common stock on the date of grant). The expense related to this award was dependent on changes in fair value of the 
SARs through July 15, 2014 (the date when the vested number of SARs were determined), and the cumulative expense was recognized 
ratably over the service period, which was initially assumed to be five years but, effective in the first quarter of 2013, had been extended 

to six and one-half years. The Firm recognized $3 million and $14 million in compensation expense in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for 
this award.

 Š The JPMorgan Chase Retirement 

Plan is a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit 

pension plan that provides benefits to substantially all 

U.S. employees. Benefits to participants are based on 

their salary and years of service, with the Plan 

employing a cash balance formula (in the form of pay 

and interest credits) to determine amounts at 

retirement. Pay credits are equal to a percentage 

(ranging from 3% to 5%) of base salary (and, effective 

January 1, 2015, bonus and incentive pay) up to 

$100,000, based on years of service. Employees begin 

to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of 

service, and benefits generally vest after three years of 

service. Interest credits generally equal the yield on 

one-year U.S. Treasury bills plus 1% (subject to a 

minimum of 4.5%). Account balances include the value 

of benefits earned under prior heritage company plans, 

if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially equivalent 
lifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or 

optionally under a variety of other payment forms, 

including a single-sum distribution. For the year ended 

December 31, 2015, Mr. Dimon, Ms. Erdoes and Mr. 

Zames each earned pay credit percentages of 4%. Ms. 

Lake and Mr. Pinto are not eligible to participate in U.S. 

benefit plans.Legacy Plan
 Š The following plan is closed to new 
participants:
Exc
etiremen
 Š Benefits were determined 
under the same terms and conditions as the 
Retirement Plan, but reflecting base salary in excess 

of IRS limits up to $1 million and benefit amounts in 

excess of IRS limits. Benefits are generally payable 

in a lump sum in the year following termination. 

Accruals under the plan were discontinued as of 

May 1, 2009.

 Š The valuation method and all material assumptions used to 

calculate the amounts above are consistent with those 

reflected in Note 9 to the Firm™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements in the 2015 Annual Report on pages 

223-230.Key assumptions include the discount rate (4.50%); 
interest rates (5.00% crediting to project cash 

balances; 3.80% to convert annuities to lump sums) 

and mortality rates (for the present value of annuities, 

the RP2014 (white-collar) projected generational 
mortality table with projection scale MP2015; for lump 

sums, the UP94 mortality table projected to 2002, with 

50%/50% male/female weighting). We assumed 

benefits would commence at normal retirement date or 

unreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid 

from the Retirement Plan were assumed to be paid 

either as single-sum distributions (with probability of 

90%) or life annuities (with probability of 10%). 

Benefits from the Excess Retirement Plan are paid as 

single-sum distributions. No death or other separation 

from service was assumed prior to retirement date.
VI. 2015 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
The Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants to defer their annual cash incentive compensation 
awards on a before-tax basis up to a maximum of $1 million. A lifetime $10 million cap applies to deferrals of cash 

made after 2005. No deferral elections have been permitted relative to equity awards since 2006. During 2015, 

there were no contributions made by the Firm nor contributions made or withdrawals or distributions received by 

the Named Executive Officers.

Marianne LakeŠŠMary Callahan ErdoesŠŠDaniel Pinto1,45920,732Matthew E. ZamesŠŠ1 The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to direct their deferrals among several investment choices, including JPMorgan Chase 
common stock; an interest income fund and the JPMorgan Chase general account of Prudential Insurance Company of America; and Hartford 
funds indexed to fixed income, bond, balanced, S&P 500, Russell 2000 and international portfolios. In addition, there are balances in deemed 
investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to new deferrals including a private equity alternative.
Investment returns in 2015 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term Fixed Income, 0.45%; Interest Income, 2.96%; Barclays 
Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, 0.48%; Balanced Portfolio, 1.16%; S&P 500 Index, 1.36%; Russell 2000 Index, (4.54)%; International, 
(0.77)%; and JPMorgan Chase common stock, including dividend equivalents, 8.39%.
Investment returns for the private equity
 investment choice, which is closed to new participants and does not permit new deferrals, are 
dependent upon the years in which a participant directed deferrals into such investment choices. For one NEO with a partial balance in such 

deferrals, the private equity investment return was 62.0%.
Beginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants were required to elect to receive 
distribution of the deferral balance beginning either following retirement or termination or in a specific year but no earlier than the second 

anniversary of the date the deferral would otherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will commence 
during the calendar year following retirement or termination. Participants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or annual installments 
for a maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2005, under the Deferred Compensation Plan, account 
balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 
15 years of service. 
The Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (ﬁSSIPﬂ) is a heritage plan applicable to former Bank One employees which is closed to new 
participants and does not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to the Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment return in 2015 for 
the following investment choice was: Short-Term Fixed Income, 0.32%.  With respect to the SSIP, account balances are automatically paid as a 
lump sum in the year following termination unless an installment option is elected prior to termination of employment.

covered government office. For such employees who 

are full career eligible, all outstanding awards continue 

to vest in accordance with their terms whether they 

leave the Firm to enter government service or 

otherwise. For employees who are not Full Career 

Eligible, the value of awards that would continue to vest 

as a result of the Government Office provisions of our 

equity plan would equal a percentage of the unvested 

stock awards shown in Table III ranging from 0% prior 

to three years of employment by the Firm to 50% after 

three years of employment rising to 100% after five 

years. 
The Firm™s Government Office provisions allow for 
accelerated vesting of the awards otherwise eligible for 

continued vesting, as described above, only if 

government ethics or conflicts of interest laws require 
divestiture of unvested awards and do not allow 

continued vesting. Notwithstanding acceleration of any 

awards, the former employee remains subject to the 

applicable terms of the award agreement as if the 

award had remained outstanding for the duration of 

the original vesting period, including the clawback 

provisions and post-employment obligations. Former 

employees who are not required to divest their 

holdings are not eligible for accelerated vesting under 

the Government Office provisions and any awards not 

eligible for continued vesting under the terms of the 

plan are forfeited; they do not accelerate.
Details regarding the potential value of such provisions 
are provided in the table below. In 2015, no current or 

former Operating Committee member received any 

benefits under these provisions.

awards continue to vest pursuant to their original vesting schedule. In the case of death and disability, option and SAR awards may be 
exercised for a specified period to the extent then exercisable or become exercisable during such exercise period.
4 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met ﬁfull-career eligibilityﬂ or other acceptable criteria, awards continue to vest

financial services company or work in their profession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided that employees may work 
for a government, education or not-for-profit organization. The awards shown represent RSUs that would continue to vest and SARs that 
would become and remain exercisable through an accelerated expiration date because the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Zames, 
have met the full-career eligibility criteria. The awards are subject to continuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period. 
In the case of Mr. Zames, the awards shown, representing RSUs and SARs, would not continue to vest because he has not met the ﬁfull-career

5 Under the terms of the Government Office provisions, Named Executive Officers would be eligible to receive the full value of their stock award 
should they resign to accept a government office that required divestiture of unvested equity awards and does not allow continued vesting.
6 Amounts shown represent balances as of December 31, 2015, under the mandatory deferral of cash bonus applicable to Mr. Pinto. For

awards continue to vest over time on their original schedule; such awards would continue to vest because Mr. Pinto has met the ﬁfull-career 
eligibilityﬂ criteria. The mandatory cash deferral awards are subject to continuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period.

   77Additional information about our directors and executive officers
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIPREPORTING COMPLIANCEOur directors and executive officers filed reports with 
the SEC indicating the number of shares of any class of 

our equity securities they owned when they became a 

director or executive officer and, after that, any 

changes in their ownership of our equity securities. 

They must also provide us with copies of these reports. 

These reports are required by Section 16(a) of the 

Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We have reviewed the 

copies of the reports that we have received and written 

representations from the individuals required to file the 

reports. Based on this review, we believe that during 

2015, each of our directors and executive officers has 

complied with applicable reporting requirements for 

transactions in our equity securities except for two late 

filings, due to administrative errors, to report 

purchases of shares by family members of Mr. Dimon in 

October 2015.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR APPROVALOF RELATED PERSONS TRANSACTIONSThe Firm has adopted a written Transactions with 
Related Persons Policy (ﬁPolicyﬂ), which sets forth the 

Firm™s policies and procedures for reviewing and 

approving transactions with related persons Š basically 

its directors, executive officers, 5% shareholders, and 

their immediate family members. The transactions 

covered by the Policy include any financial transaction, 

arrangement or relationship in which the Firm is a 

participant, the related person has or will have a direct 

or indirect material interest, and the aggregate amount 

involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 

in any fiscal year.
After becoming aware of any transaction which may be 
subject to the Policy, the related person is required to 

report all relevant facts with respect to the transaction 

to the General Counsel of the Firm. Upon determination 

by the General Counsel that a transaction requires 

review under the Policy, the material facts respecting 

the transaction and the related person™s interest in the 

transaction are provided, in the case of directors, to the 

Governance Committee and, in the case of executive 

officers and 5% shareholders, to the Audit Committee.
The transaction is then reviewed by the disinterested 

members of the applicable committee, which then 

determines whether approval or ratification of the 

transaction shall be granted. In reviewing a transaction, 

the applicable committee considers facts and 

circumstances that it deems relevant to its 

determination. Material facts may include 

management™s assessment of the commercial 

reasonableness of the transaction; the materiality of 

the related person™s direct or indirect interest in the 

transaction; whether the transaction may involve an 

actual, or the appearance of, a conflict of interest; and, 

if the transaction involves a director, the impact of the 

transaction on the director™s independence.
Certain types of transactions are pre-approved in 
accordance with the terms of the Policy. These include 

transactions in the ordinary course of business 

involving financial products and services provided by, 

or to, the Firm, including loans, provided such 

transactions are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley 

Act of 2002, Federal Reserve Board Regulation O and 

other applicable laws and regulations.
TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVEOFFICERS AND 5% SHAREHOLDERSOur directors and executive officers, and some of their 
immediate family members and affiliated entities, and 

BlackRock and Vanguard, beneficial owners of more 

than 5% of our outstanding common stock, were 

customers of, or had transactions with, JPMorgan Chase 

or our banking or other subsidiaries in the ordinary 

course of business during 2015. Additional

Proposal 3 Š Ratification of independent registered public accounting firm
EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the 
appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of 

the Firm™s independent registered public accounting 

firm. The Audit Committee has appointed 

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (ﬁPwCﬂ) as the Firm™s 

independent registered public accounting firm to audit 

the Consolidated Financial Statements of JPMorgan 

Chase and its subsidiaries for the year ending 

December 31, 2016. A resolution will be presented at 

the meeting to ratify PwC™s appointment. If the 

shareholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the 

Audit Committee will consider other independent 

registered public accounting firms.
In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, audit 
partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit 

the number of consecutive years of service an 

individual partner may provide audit service to our 

Firm. The lead audit partner may provide service to our 

Firm for a maximum of five consecutive years. 

Commencing with the 2016 audit, a new lead audit 

partner has been designated for the Firm who is 

expected to serve in this capacity through the end of 

the 2020 audit. The Audit Committee was directly 

involved in the selection of the new lead audit partner. 
For the reasons stated in the Audit Committee report 
included in this proxy statement on pages 82-83, the 

members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe 

that continued retention of PwC as the Firm™s 

independent external auditor is in the best interests of 

JPMorgan Chase and its shareholders.
A member of PwC will be present at the annual 
meeting, and will have the opportunity to make a 

statement and respond to appropriate questions from 

shareholders.
The Board of Directors recommends that 
shareholders vote 
FOR
 ratification of PwC 
as the Firm™s independent registered public 
accounting firm for 2016.
FEES PAID TO PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLPThe Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee 

negotiations associated with the Firm™s retention of 

PwC. Aggregate fees for professional services rendered 

by PwC for JPMorgan Chase with respect to the years 

ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were:

Audit-related24.421.8
Tax4.88.8All otherŠŠTotal$90.9$90.9
Excluded from 2015 and 2014 amounts are audit, 

audit-related and tax fees totaling $26.2 million and 

$23.3 million, respectively, paid to PwC by private 

equity funds, commingled trust funds and special 

purpose vehicles that are managed or advised by 

subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase but are not 

consolidated with the Firm. 
Audit fees 
Audit fees for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 

2014, were $43.0 million and $41.5 million, 

respectively, for the annual audit and quarterly reviews 

of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for the 

annual audit of the Firm™s internal control over financial 

reporting, and $18.7 million and $18.8 million, 

respectively, for services related to statutory/subsidiary 

audits, attestation reports required by statute or 

regulation, and comfort letters and consents related to 

SEC filings and other similar filings with international 

authorities.
Audit-related fees 
Audit-related fees comprise assurance and related 

services that are traditionally performed by the 

independent registered public accounting firm. These 

services include attestation and agreed-upon 

procedures which address accounting, reporting and 

control matters. These services are normally provided 

in connection with the recurring audit engagement.
Tax fees
Tax fees for 2015 and 2014 were $3.7 million and 

$1.8 million, respectively, for tax compliance and tax 

return preparation services, and $1.1 million and $7.0 

million, respectively, for other tax services.
The Firm is committed to reducing the amount of tax 
services provided by PwC and, accordingly, intends to 

use alternate service providers when appropriate or 

practicable.

   81AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICIES 
AND PROCEDURES
It is JPMorgan Chase™s policy not to use PwC™s services 
other than for audit, audit-related and tax services. 
All services performed by PwC in 2015 and 2014 were 
approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 

has adopted pre-approval procedures for services 

provided by PwC. These procedures require that the 

terms and fees for the annual audit service 

engagement be approved by the Audit Committee. For 

audit, audit-related and tax services, the Audit 

Committee annually reviews and pre-approves a list of 

specified services and the costs estimated to be 

incurred with respect to the provision of such services. 

All requests for PwC audit, audit-related and tax 

services must be submitted to the Firm™s Corporate 

Controller to determine if such services are included 

within the list of services that have received Audit 

Committee pre-approval. All requests for audit, audit-

related and tax services that have not been pre-

approved by the Audit Committee and all fee amounts 

in excess of the pre-approved  estimated cost amounts 

must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee. 

In addition, all requests for audit, audit-related and tax

Audit Committee report
Three non-management directors comprise the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorgan 

Chase. The Board has determined that each member of 

our committee has no material relationship with the 

Firm under the Board™s director independence 

standards and that each is independent under the 

listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange 

(ﬁNYSEﬂ), where the Firm™s securities are listed, and 

under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission™s 

(ﬁSECﬂ) standards relating to the independence of audit 

committees. The Board has also determined that each 

member is financially literate and is an audit committee 

financial expert as defined by the SEC.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter 
adopted by the Board, which is available on our website 

at jpmorganchase.com under the heading ﬁAudit 

Committeeﬂ (located under Board Committees, located 

under the Governance section of the About Us tab). We 

annually review our written charter and our practices. 

We have determined that our charter and practices are 

consistent with the listing standards of the NYSE and 

the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The 

purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist Board 

oversight of: 
the independent registered public accounting firm™s 
qualifications and independence 
the performance of the internal audit function and 

that of the independent registered public 

accounting firm, and
management™s responsibilities to assure that there 

is in place an effective system of controls 

reasonably designed to safeguard the assets and 

income of the Firm; assure the integrity of the 

Firm™s financial statements; and maintain 

compliance with the Firm™s ethical standards, 

policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and 

regulations
We discussed with PwC the matters required to be 

discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight 

Board (ﬁPCAOBﬂ) Auditing Standard No. 1301 

(Communications with Audit Committees), including 

PwC™s overall audit scope and audit approach as set 

forth in the terms of their engagement letter; PwC™s 

overall audit strategy for significant audit risks 

identified by them; and the nature and extent of the 

specialized skills necessary to perform the planned 
audit. We have established procedures to receive and 

track the handling of complaints regarding accounting, 

internal control and auditing matters. In addition, we 

monitor the audit, audit-related and tax services 

provided by PwC. 
Details of the fees paid to PwC in respect of its services, 
as well as the Audit Committee™s ﬁpre-approval policyﬂ 

regarding PwC™s fees, can be found on pages 
80-81 of this proxy statement.
The Audit Committee annually reviews PwC™s 
qualifications, performance and independence in 

connection with the determination as to whether to 

retain PwC. In conducting our review we considered, 

among other things:
the professional qualifications of PwC, and that of 
the lead audit partner and other key engagement 

partners
PwC™s historical and recent performance on the 

Firm™s audit, including the extent and quality of 

PwC™s communications with the Audit Committee
an analysis of PwC™s known legal risks and 

significant proceedings that may impair PwC™s 

ability to perform the Firm™s annual audit
data relating to audit quality and performance, 

including the most recent PCAOB reports on PwC 

and its global network of firms, and the results of 

peer review and self-review examinations
the appropriateness of PwC™s fees, both on an 

absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by 

certain peer banking firms
PwC™s independence policies and its processes for 

maintaining its independence
PwC™s tenure as the Firm™s independent auditor and 

its depth of understanding of the Firm™s global 

businesses, operations and systems, accounting 

policies and practices, including the potential effect 

on the financial statements of the major risks and 

exposures facing the Firm, and internal control over 

financial reporting 
PwC™s demonstrated professional skepticism and 

objectivity, including the fresh perspectives brought 

through the periodic required rotation of the lead 

audit partner, the quality review partner and other

PwC™s capability, expertise and efficiency in 

handling the breadth and complexity of the Firm™s 

global operations, including the expertise and 

capability of PwC™s lead audit partner for the Firm, 

and the advisability and potential impact of selecting a 

different independent public accounting firm 
PwC provided us the written disclosures and the letter 

required by PCAOB™s Ethics and Independence Rule 

3526 (Communications with Audit Committees 

Concerning Independence), and we discussed and 

confirmed with PwC their independence. 
As a result of this evaluation, we believe that PwC has 
the capability to provide the necessary expertise to 

audit the Firm™s businesses on a global basis, and we 

approved the appointment of PwC as JPMorgan Chase™s 

independent registered public accounting firm for 

2016, subject to shareholder ratification. 
Management is responsible for the Firm™s internal 
control over financial reporting, the financial reporting 

process and JPMorgan Chase™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements. PwC is responsible for performing an 

independent audit of JPMorgan Chase™s Consolidated 

Financial Statements and of the effectiveness of 

internal control over financial reporting in accordance 

with auditing standards promulgated by the PCAOB. 

The Firm™s Internal Audit Department, under the 

direction of the General Auditor, reports directly to the 

Audit Committee (and administratively to the CEO) and 

is responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and 

conducting internal audits intended to evaluate the 

Firm™s internal control structure and compliance with 

applicable regulatory requirements. The members of 

the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in 

the practice of accounting or auditing; as noted above, 

the Audit Committee™s responsibility is to monitor and 

oversee these processes.
We regularly meet and hold discussions with the Firm™s 
management, internal auditors and with PwC, as well 

as private sessions with the General Auditor and with 

PwC without members of management present. 

Management represented to us that JPMorgan Chase™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in 

accordance with accounting principles generally 

accepted in the United States of America (ﬁU.S. GAAPﬂ). 
We reviewed and discussed JPMorgan Chase™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements with management, 

the General Auditor and PwC. We also discussed with 

PwC the quality of the Firm™s accounting principles, the 

reasonableness of critical accounting estimates and 

judgments, and the disclosures in JPMorgan Chase™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements, including 

disclosures relating to significant accounting policies. 

We rely, without independent verification, on the 

information provided to us and on the representations 

made by management, internal auditors and the 

independent auditor. Based on our discussions with the 

Firm™s management, internal auditors and PwC, as well 

as our review of the representations given to us and 

PwC™s reports to us, we recommended to the Board, 

and the Board approved, inclusion of the audited 

Consolidated Financial Statements in JPMorgan Chase™s 

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 

December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.

   85Proposal 4 
Independent board chairman Š require an independent chair 
John Chevedden, as agent for William Steiner, 112 
Abbotsford Gate, Piermont NY 10968, the holder of 

shares of our common stock with a market value in 

excess of $2,000, has advised us that he intends to 

introduce the following resolution:
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt 
as policy, and amend our governing documents as 

necessary, to require the Chair of the Board of 

Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent 

member of the Board. The Board would have the 

discretion to phase in this policy for the next CEO 

transition, implemented so it does not violate any 

existing agreement. If the Board determines that a 

Chair who was independent when selected is no longer 

independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who 

satisfies the requirements of the policy within a 

reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy 

is waived if no independent director is available and 

willing to serve as Chair. This proposal requests that all 

the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.
According to Institutional Shareholder Services 53% of 
the Standard & Poors 1,500 firms separate these 2 

positions Š ﬁ2015 Board Practices,ﬂ April 12, 2015. 

This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major 

U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at 

Netflix. Shareholders of our company previously gave a 

substantial 40%-vote of support for this topic.
It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to 
protect shareholders™ long-term interests by providing 

independent oversight of management. By setting 

agendas, priorities and procedures, the Chairman is 

critical in shaping the work of the Board.
A board of directors is less likely to provide rigorous 
independent oversight of management if the Chairman 

is also the CEO, as is the case with our Company. Having 

a board chairman who is independent of management 

is a practice that will promote greater management 

accountability to shareholders and lead to a more 

objective evaluation of management.
According to the Millstein Center for Corporate 
Governance and Performance (Yale School of 

Management), ﬁThe independent chair curbs conflicts 

of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the 

relationship between the board and CEO, serves as a 
conduit for regular communication with shareowners, 

and is a logical next step in the development of an 

independent board.ﬂ
An NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Directors™ 
Professionalism recommended that an independent 

director should be charged with ﬁ
organizing 
the board™s 
evaluation of the CEO and provide ongoing feedback; 

chairing executive sessions of the board; setting the 

agenda and leading the board in anticipating and 

responding to crises.ﬂ A blue-ribbon report from The 

Conference Board also supported this position.
A number of institutional investors said that a strong, 
objective board leader can best provide the necessary 

oversight of management. Thus, the California Public 

Employees™ Retirement System™s Global Principles of 

Accountable Corporate Governance recommends that a 

company™s board should be chaired by an independent 

director, as does the Council of Institutional Investors.
An independent director serving as chairman can help 
ensure the functioning of an effective board. Please 

vote to enhance shareholder value:
Independent Board Chairman Š Proposal 4
BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 4The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders 
vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
The Board of Directors has an unremitting
fiduciary duty to act as it believes to be in the best
interests of the Firm and its shareholders and
should retain the responsibility to determine the
Board leadership structure that will best serve
those interests.The Board believes its responsibility to shareholders 

requires that it retain the flexibility to determine the 

best leadership structure for any particular set of 

circumstances and personnel. The adoption of a policy 

requiring
 that the Chairman of the Board be an 

independent director could limit the Board™s ability to 

choose the person best suited for the role at a 

particular time.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
The Firm™s Corporate Governance Principlesprovide that the Board annually, and in connection
with succession planning and the selection of a
new CEO, review and determine whether the role
of Chairman should be a non-executive position or
combined with that of the CEO.The Board regularly considers the issue of board 

leadership in committee meetings and meetings of the 

independent directors. The Board has separated the 

positions of Chairman and CEO in the past and may do 

so again in the future if it believes that would be in the 

best interests of the Firm and its shareholders. These 

decisions should not be mechanical; they should be 

contextual and based on the particular composition of 

the Board, the individual then serving or selected to 

serve as CEO and the needs and opportunities of the 

Firm as they change over time. As the Board reviews its 

leadership structure, it considers a variety of factors, 

with a particular focus on those listed on page 20 of 

this proxy statement. 
Early in 2016, the Board reviewed its leadership 
structure and determined that, at the present time, 

combining the roles of Chairman and CEO, together 

with a strong Lead Independent Director, continues to 

provide the appropriate leadership and oversight of the 

Firm and facilitates effective functioning of both the 

Board and management.
The Firm™s current governance structure provides
the independent leadership and management
oversight sought by the proposal.Pursuant to the Firm™s Corporate Governance 

Principles, when the positions of Chairman and CEO are 

held by one individual, the independent directors will 

annually appoint an independent director to serve as 

Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent 

Director has significant authority and responsibilities 

with respect to the operation of the Board. Additional 

information concerning the Lead Independent Director 

role at the Firm is available under the heading ﬁBoard 

Structure and Responsibilitiesﬂ on page 20 of this proxy 

statement.
The Board regularly seeks and considers feedback
from shareholders on the Firm™s leadership
structure.The Board recognizes the importance of the Firm™s 

leadership structure to our shareholders and regularly 

receives feedback from shareholders on the topic 

through direct engagement with shareholders and 

information gained from the Firm™s outreach program 

(see ﬁShareholder engagementﬂ on page 27 of this 

proxy statement). Many of our shareholders have 

expressed the opinion that there is no ﬁone size fits allﬂ 

solution and that the Board™s fiduciary responsibility is 

best met by retaining the flexibility to choose the most 

effective leadership structure for a particular set of 

facts facing the Firm at any point in time. A significant 

majority of our shareholders have repeatedly voted 

against proposals that would mandate the Firm™s 

leadership structure and eliminate Board discretion.
The Board™s belief in the importance of retaining
the flexibility to determine the best leadership
structure is consistent with the policies and
practices at other large companies.According to the 
Spencer Stuart Board Index 2015
, only 
21 S&P 500 companies (4%) have adopted a formal 

policy requiring separation of the Chairman and CEO 

roles. Among Chairmen at S&P 500 companies, 52% 

are the current CEO, 29% are independent, 18% are 

former CEOs or current executives, and 1% are outside 

related directors. These statistics support the Board™s 

strongly held view that it should retain the 

responsibility to determine the Board leadership 

structure that will best serve the interests of the Firm 

and its shareholders. 
The Board of Directors recommends a 
vote 
AGAINST
 this proposal.

How votes are counted Š count votes using only for and against and ignore 
abstentions
Newground Social investment, 10033-12th Avenue NW, 
Seattle, WA 98177, as agent for Ms. Mercy A. Rome and 

Equality Network Foundation, and co-sponsors First 

Affirmative Financial Network, LLC, as proxy for Ms. 

Katherine E. Stearns, and United Church Funds, each of 

which are the beneficial owners of our common stock 

with a market value in excess of $2,000, have advised 

us that they intend to introduce the following 

resolution:
RESOLVED: 
Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
(ﬁJPMorganﬂ) hereby request the Board to take or 

initiate the steps necessary to amend our Company™s 

governing documents to provide that all non-binding 

matters presented by shareholders shall be decided by 

a simple majority of the votes cast FOR and AGAINST an 

item. This policy shall apply to all such matters unless 

shareholders have approved higher thresholds, or 

applicable laws or stock exchange regulations dictate 

otherwise. 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT: 

A simple-majority formula includes FOR and AGAINST 
votes, but not abstentions.
JPMorgan™s current policies disadvantage shareholders 
in three ways: 
1. Abstentions are treated as votes AGAINST every 
shareholder-sponsored item, but 
not when tallying management™s Director election. 

This advantages management while harming 
shareholder interest. 
Why provide ballots on shareholder proposals that 
offer three choices Š FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN Š 

when in reality, stockholders only have two choices: 

FOR or AGAINST? 
Absent conducting a survey, it seems presumptuous 
to assume that every abstaining voter has read the 

entire proxy and intends their vote to be treated as 

AGAINST all shareholder items. 
2. Counting abstentions depresses outcomes.
By simple math, including abstentions in a formula 

lowers the vote result and raises the threshold 

required to pass a resolution. 
This constitutes an unacknowledged supermajority 

Š as the percentage of abstentions rise, the 

supermajority threshold increases at an exponential 

rate. 
3. Counting abstentions distorts communication. 
These practices cloud communication at the 

stockholder meeting - which is the only opportunity 

most shareholders have each year to interact with 

each other, management, and the Board. 
Of greater concern, JPMorgan™s voting policies Š 
which discriminate against shareholders Š create 

misimpressions that endure. Once figures are 

reported in the press, they become indelibly 

imprinted on the minds of shareholders and lodged 

in the public record. 
Three facts: 

Any suggestion that management- and shareholder-

sponsored items are treated ﬁidenticallyﬂ or 

ﬁequallyﬂ is false, because management-sponsored 

Director elections do not include abstentions in 

their formula. 
CalPERS research found that 48% of the nation™s 

largest corporations employ a simple-majority 

standard Š making it a mainstream practice. 
Under this proposal, shareholders retain the right to 

‚send a message™ by abstaining Š in fact, message-

sending may be more effective if JPMorgan 
cannot use abstentions to depress reported outcomes on 

shareholder proposals. 
Notable entities favor simple-majority voting: 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (Staff 
Legal Bulletin No. 14): 

ﬁOnly votes FOR and AGAINST a proposal are 

included in the calculation of the shareholder vote 

of that proposal. Abstentions ... are not included in 

this calculation.ﬂInstitutional Shareholder Services 
(ﬁISSﬂ Š the 

nation™s leading proxy reporting service): 
ﬁ...a simple majority of voting shares should be all 
that is necessary to effect change regarding a 

company and its governance provisions.ﬂ

The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders 

vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
The proponent™s proposal advocates lowering the 
approval standard for shareholder voting (and 

therefore making approval easier) by ignoring 

abstentions in vote tabulation. We believe this would 

not be in the best interests of our shareholders. It is 

our view that the proponent of a proposal should be 

able to persuade a majority of those present and 

eligible to vote to affirmatively vote for the matter in 

order for it to be approved.
en
onBy


Our vote counting methods apply identically to 

shareholder-sponsored and management-sponsored 

proposals. For both, abstentions are treated the same 

way Š they are counted and will have the same effect 

as a vote against the proposal. The only exception to 

this is for the election of directors. For example, the 

proposal in this proxy statement to approve the 

advisory resolution on executive compensation (ﬁSay 

on Payﬂ) is a management-sponsored proposal. 

Abstention votes will have the same effect as a vote 

against this proposal, as would be the case if it were a 

shareholder-sponsored proposal. The vote counting 

method we use does not favor management proposals 

over shareholder proposals. They are treated equally.
Shareholders cast their votes knowing that votes to 
abstain are counted as votes against a proposal. 
Shareholders typically have three voting choices for a 

particular proposal: ﬁfor,ﬂ ﬁagainstﬂ and ﬁabstain.ﬂ Our 

proxy statement clearly describes how each of these 

voting choices will be counted; including that 

abstentions will be counted as a vote against. Moreover, 

in some instances, shareholder groups/institutions may 

publish proxy voting guidelines that call for an 

ﬁabstainﬂ vote under specified circumstances. The 

proponent™s proposal would disregard such ﬁabstainﬂ 

votes, thus potentially disenfranchising those 

shareholders. 
To review our description of vote counting, including 
the treatment of abstentions, please see ﬁHow Votes 

Are Countedﬂ on page 99 of this proxy statement.

JPMorgan Chase is incorporated in the State of 
Delaware. As a result, the Delaware General 

Corporation Law (the ﬁDGCLﬂ) governs the voting 

standards applicable to actions taken by our 

shareholders. Our current By-law on this topic follows 

the default voting standard under Section 216(2) of 

the DGCL and we believe is also consistent with the 

voting standards adopted by the majority of Delaware 

corporations.
Under our By-laws, when a quorum is present, the vote 
of the holders of a majority in voting interest of the 

shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled 

to vote is required to approve any matter brought 

before the meeting of shareholders, other than the 

election of directors. Under the DGCL, and the Firm™s 

By-laws, shares that abstain constitute shares that are 

present and entitled to vote. As a result, in the vote 

tabulation, abstentions are not included in the 

numerator (because they are not votes ﬁforﬂ the 

matter) but are included in the denominator as shares 

entitled to vote. Or, more simply, shares abstaining 

have the practical effect of being voted ﬁagainstﬂ the 

matter under both our current By-laws and the default 

voting standard established by the DGCL.
The Board of Directors recommends a 
vote

introduce the following resolution:
RESOLVED
: Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the

policy prohib
iting the vesting of equity-based awards 

for senior executives due to a voluntary resignation to 

enter government serv
ice (a ﬁGovernment Service 

Golden Parachuteﬂ)
.For purposes of this resolution, ﬁequity-based awardsﬂ 
include stock options, restricted stock and other stock 

awards granted under an equity incentive plan
. 
ﬁGovernment serviceﬂ includes employment with any 
U.S. federal, state or local government, any 

supranational or international organization, any self-

regulatory organization, or any agency or 

instrumentality of any such government or 

organization, or any electoral campaign for public 

office.
This policy shall be implemented so as not to violate 
existing contractual obligations or the terms of any 

compensation or benefit plan currently in existence on 

the date this proposal is adopted, and it shall apply 

only to equity awards or plan amendments that 

shareholders approve after the date of the 2016 

annual meeting.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT
:Our Company provides its senior executives with 
vesting of equity-based awards after their voluntary 

resignation of employment from the Company to 

pursue a career in government service. In other words, 

our Company gives a ﬁgolden parachuteﬂ for entering 

government service.
At most companies, equity-based awards vest over a 
period of time to compensate executives for their labor 

during the commensurate period. If an executive 

voluntarily resigns before the vesting criteria are 

satisfied, unvested awards are usually forfeited
. While 
government serv
ice is commendable
, we question the 
practice of our Company provid
ing acce
lerated vesting 
of equity-based awards to execut
ives who voluntarily 
resign to enter government service
.The vesting of equity-based awards over a period of 

time is a powerful tool for companies to attract and 

retain talented employees. But contrary to this goal, 

our Company™s Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for 

the accelerated vesting of restricted stock to executives 

who are members of the company™s operating 

committee if they depart the firm to run for elected 

office or are appointed to a government position
.We believe that compensation plans should align the 
interests of senior executives with the long-term 

interests of the Company
. We oppose compensation 
plans that provide windfalls to executives that are 

unrelated to their performance. For these reasons, we 

question how our Company benefits from providing 

Government Service Golden Parachutes
. Surely our 

Company does not expect to receive favorable 

treatment from its former executives?
For these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR 
this proposal.
BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 6The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders 

vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
Our Government Office compensation provisions
are intended to help us attract talented and
dedicated people.The Firm believes that public service is a high calling 

and important to the communities that we serve. The 

Government Office provisions were added to our 

compensation program to demonstrate the Firm™s 

support for public service. Our compensation program 

shows respect  for those choosing to enter public 

service and is intended to help enable us to hire the 

best and brightest employees, which is clearly in the 

best interests of shareholders and the Firm. While we 

do not want to lose these employees, we also do not 

want to penalize them for pursuing public service.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
The Government Office terms of our equity planare the same for all participants.JPMorgan Chase senior executives participate in a 

broad-based equity plan. Thousands of the Firm™s 

employees typically receive equity compensation 

awards in a given year. All who receive equity awards 

have the same Government Office provisions. They are 

not a special benefit for senior executives. These 

provisions enhance our ability to attract the most 

talented and dedicated people to a wide range of 

positions in the Firm. We do not believe the proposed 

prohibition would be in the best interests of our 

employees or our shareholders.
The Government Office accelerated distribution
provisions do not provide employees with a
windfall.These provisions do not reward employees for leaving 

the Firm to enter government service; they merely 

remove an impediment by enabling any such 

employees, under specified conditions, to keep 

deferred equity compensation awarded in connection 

with past service to the Firm.
Our equity plan provides for acceleration of distribution 
of any equity awards eligible for continued vesting 

pursuant to the terms of the plan 
only if government 
ethics or conflicts of interest laws require divestiture of 

unvested equity awards and do not allow continued 

vesting. This enables the immediate sale of the 

securities. Notwithstanding acceleration of any awards, 

the former employee remains subject to the applicable 

terms of the award agreement as if the award had 

remained outstanding for the duration of the original 

vesting period, including the clawback provisions and 

post-employment obligations. Former employees who 

are not so required to divest their equity holdings are 

not eligible for accelerated distribution under the 

Government Office provisions and any equity awards 

not eligible for continued vesting under the terms of 

the equity plan are forfeited.
The proxy statement discloses detailed
information about the Government Office
provisions. We have enhanced this disclosure in
response to shareholder feedback.JPMorgan Chase senior executives participate in a 

broad-based equity plan. The terms of the plan are 

disclosed in public SEC filings and apply equally to all 

employees. We have provided details in Table III of the 

Executive Compensation Tables (see page 
68 of this 
proxy statement), which reports the value of unvested 

equity awards, and Table VII (see page 
72 of this proxy 

statement), which reports the value of equity awards 

payable upon resignation. Through our shareholder 

engagement program, shareholders indicated they 

would like more information about our Government 

Office provisions. This additional information is

has advised us that he intends to introduce the 

following resolution:
Resolved, that stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
urge that: 
1. The Board of Directors should appoint a committee 
(the ‚Stockholder Value Committee™) composed 
exclusively of independent directors to address 

whether the divestiture of all non-core banking 

business segments would enhance shareholder 

value. 
2. The Stockholder Value Committee should publicly 
report on its analysis to stockholders no later than 

300 days after the 2016 Annual Meeting of 

Stockholders, although confidential information 

may be withheld. 
3. In carrying out its evaluation, the Stockholder 
Value Committee should avail itself at reasonable 

cost of such independent legal, investment banking 

and other third party advisers as the Stockholder 

Value Committee determines is necessary or 

appropriate in its sole discretion. 
For purposes of this proposal, ﬁnon-core banking 

operationsﬂ mean operations that are conducted by 

affiliates other than the affiliate the corporation 

identifies as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which holds 

the FDIC Certificate No 628.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT 

The financial crisis that began in 2008 revealed that 
some banks were ﬁtoo big to fail.ﬂ  This is the moral 

hazard that invites managers to take extraordinary 

risks with an understanding that taxpayers will rescue 

the firm, as failure would cause widespread financial 

chaos. That 2008 rescue may have served JP Morgan™s 

creditors, but shareholders suffered. JP Morgan stock 

fell from $49.63 on Oct 1, 2008, to $15.93, on March 

6, 2009.  Risk-taking at major banks can be especially lethal 

following the elimination of certain activity restrictions 

(known in the vernacular as ﬁGlass-Steagallﬂ) on how a 

bank can deploy FDIC-insured deposits. Congress began 

to address some of these problems with the 2010 

Dodd-Frank Act. But an analysis by Goldman Sachs 

argues that implementation of this law means JP 

Morgan would be worth more in parts. 
The crisis and subsequent events have also 
demonstrated that JP Morgan may be ﬁtoo big to 

manage.ﬂ Mismanagement of deposits by a half-dozen 

London-based traders (known as the ﬁLondon Whaleﬂ) 

sent JP Morgan stock down 24 percent. Further, 

shareholders have paid more than $30 billion in fines 

because bank managers failed to prevent misconduct in 

a variety of operations. 
We therefore recommend that the board act to explore 
options to split the firm into two or more companies, 

with one performing basic business and consumer 

lending with FDIC-guaranteed deposit liabilities, and 

the other businesses focused on investment banking 

such as underwriting, trading and market-making.  

Divestiture would also give investors more choice and 

control about investment risks.
We recognize management opposes a break up on the 
grounds of value generated by scale and synergy. 

Ideally, such arguments will withstand the scrutiny of 

an independent study. 
BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 7The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders 

vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
The proposal is asking the Board  to create a specific 
organizational structure - a ‚Shareholder Value 

Committee™ - charged with the single purpose of 

analyzing one specific strategy, namely, the divestiture 

of all ﬁoperations that are conducted by affiliates other 

than – JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A–.ﬂ

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
Our Board is focused on enhancing long-termshareholder value and provides active oversight of
management™s strategy.Reviews of the Firm™s strategy are done on a continuing  

basis and evaluate a range of assumptions including 

synergies between businesses, the value proposition to 

clients, and the benefits of scale. The Firm™s 

consideration of strategy is also informed by extensive 

and ongoing investor outreach, as described under the 

heading ﬁShareholder engagementﬂ on page 27 of this 

proxy statement. In 2015, these outreach efforts 

included: Hosting more than 90 shareholder calls and 
meetings on strategy, governance and 

compensation topics with shareholders representing  

over 40% of our outstanding common stock
Participating in more than 50 investor meetings and 

presenting at 13 investor conferences  
Conducting 10 investor trips throughout the U.S., as 

well as international trips to Asia and Europe
The Board and management do not favor size for its 

own sake or support or oppose any strategy on 

ideological grounds, but instead analyze strategy from 

the perspective of serving the Firm™s clients, customers 

and communities and how we believe any particular 

strategic initiative will affect long-term shareholder 

value.  
The Board reviewed with management its analysis
reported to shareholders at our 2015 Investor Day
on February 24, 2015, of a potential separation
scenario and concurred in the conclusion that
continuing our strategy and delivering on our
commitments is the highest-certainty path to
enhancing long-term shareholder value.The Firm continues to successfully adapt its strategy 

and financial architecture in the constantly evolving 

banking landscape, including consistently meeting 

regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, while 

serving its clients and customers, investing in its 

businesses, and delivering strong returns to its 

shareholders. 
In 2015, the Firm met or exceeded targets related to 

balance sheet optimization and managing its capital, its 

GSIB surcharge and expenses. The Firm:
Reduced total assets by approximately $200 billion
Increased its capital by 140 basis points, ending the 
year with an 11.6% Basel III Advanced Fully 

Phased-In Advanced CET1 ratio
Reduced its estimate of the GSIB capital surcharge 

by 100 basis points to 3.5%
Substantially completed its business simplification 

agenda, exiting businesses, products or clients that 

were not fundamental to our business, not at scale 

or not returning the appropriate level of return in 

order to focus on core activities for its core clients 

and reduce risk to the Firm 
The Firm also continues to make progress on 

simplifying its legal entity structure, streamlining its 

Global Technology function, rationalizing its use of 

vendors, and optimizing its real estate location 

strategy. Furthermore, the Firm has strengthened its 

control environment through enhancements to its 

infrastructure, technology, operating standards and 

governance.  
Our mix of products and services and our global
structure are driven by the clients, customers and
communities we serve.Clients and customers choose JPMorgan Chase because 

of the breadth and quality of the services we provide.  

It is what they want and what they need. We have 

demonstrated our ability to adapt our model, including 

the services we offer, to meet their needs, and our 

clients benefit from this client-driven focus. We believe 

this is evidenced by our market share gains and in our 

leadership positions. Across our businesses, we seek to 

align appropriate product and service capabilities to 

different stages in the consumer and corporate life 

cycles. Our diversification and scale are the key to this 

and enables us to serve our customers and clients, 

which include nearly 50% of U.S. households and 

approximately 80% of Fortune 500 companies.

ATEMENTPROPOSAL 7Table of Contents
JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.   
   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   93Our operating model benefits from diversificationand scale.Our businesses generate significant benefits from each 

other, which we estimated at approximately $18 billion 

of pretax synergies in our 2015 Investor Day.  

Separating our businesses would not only result in the 

loss of some of these synergies but would also incur 

significant costs resulting from the need to duplicate 

corporate functions, replicate critical infrastructure, 

and the likelihood that each separated entity would 

need to make significant investments to build and grow 

over time. Each of our businesses benefits from our $9 

billion annual technology spend, including the more 

than $600 million we expect to spend this year on 

cybersecurity.
The proposal mischaracterizes the research report 
published by Goldman Sachs in January 2015. That 

report did 
not conclude the Firm should divest 

significant businesses. While the illustrative analysis 

highlighted potential value in a separation, the report 

acknowledged the analysis was based on a wide range 

of outcomes and sensitive assumptions, and that a 

separation would carry considerable execution risk.
1Our business model has also delivered stable results 

over time, 
with low total revenue volatility, including 

low volatility in fee income, reflecting the benefits of 

our diversified operating model. These results include 

our Markets business, which is typically perceived as 

being more volatile.
 The Firm continues to deliver strong long-term financial 
performance and sustained shareholder value, as 

discussed on pages 39-44 of this proxy statement. In 

2015, we generated record net income of $24.4 

billion, record earnings per share of $6.00, and 13% 

ROTCE on $9 billion higher average equity capital, with 

each of our leading client franchises exhibiting strong 

performance and together delivering significant value.
We have a resilient business model built on a
fortress balance sheet.Capital and liquidity levels are higher today for the Firm 

than they have ever been and are supported by 

stringent internal and regulatory stress testing and 

Recovery & Resolution planning. During our 2016 

Investor Day, we showed the extent to which the Firm is 

resilient to capital loss and liquidity stress post crisis, 

including $350 billion of total loss absorbing resources 

to withstand a severe stress environment. To put that in 

context, the Firm™s 2015 nine quarter CCAR losses in a 

severely adverse stress scenario were $55 billion, on a 

pretax basis. 
We believe that forming a Board committee to
review the divestitures specified in this proposal
would not enhance shareholder value.The Firm reviews its business strategy on an on-going 

basis. We have reported on our business model in our 

2014, 2015 and 2016 Investor Days, and we have an 

ongoing dialogue with shareholders. In particular, the 

Firm addressed potential separation scenarios 

extensively at the 2015 Investor Day, and concluded 

that splitting off one or more businesses would likely 

negatively impact long-term shareholder value. The 

Board has shown it is willing to exit businesses, 

products or clients not fundamental to our business or 

not generating the appropriate level of return. The 

Board will continue its active oversight of strategy and 

therefore believes the formation of a special committee 

as proposed is unnecessary.
The Board of Directors recommends a 
vote 
AGAINST
 this proposal.
_________1 The report noted: ﬁWhile a breakup thus looks accretive, we would weigh this against the execution risk associated with a breakup of this 
magnitude, likely reductions in JPM™s estimated net income synergies of $6-7bn and the consideration that each standalone business would 
likely still be subject to CCAR (although perhaps not asset management), which remains the binding capital constraint for most banks. And 
despite its higher G-SIB requirement, JPM™s current ROTCE potential remains higher than that of most peers, which face similarly high capital 
requirements as JPM after factoring in CCAR.ﬂ

Proposal 8
Clawback amendment Š defer compensation for 10 years to help satisfy any 
monetary penalty associated with violation of law
John Chevedden, as agent for Kenneth Steiner, 14 

Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, the holder 

of shares of our common stock with a market value in 

excess of $2,000, has advised us that he intends to 

introduce the following resolution:
RESOLVED, shareholders urge our Board of Directors to 
amend the General Clawback policy to provide that a 

substantial portion of annual total compensation of 

Executive Officers, identified by the board, shall be 

deferred and be forfeited in part or in whole, at the 

discretion of Board, to help satisfy any monetary 

penalty associated with any violation of law regardless 

of any determined responsibility by any individual 

officer; and that this annual deferred compensation be 

paid to the officers no sooner than 10 years after the 

absence of any monetary penalty; and that any 

forfeiture and relevant circumstances be reported to 

shareholders. These amendments should operate 

prospectively and be implemented in a way that does 

not violate any contract, compensation plan, law or 

regulation.
President William Dudley of the New York Federal 
Reserve outlined the utility of what he called a 

performance bond. ﬁIn the case of a large fine, the 

senior management ... would forfeit their performance 

bond .... Each individual™s ability to realize their 

deferred debt compensation would depend not only on 

their own behavior, but 
also on the behavior of their 

colleagues. This would create a strong incentive for 

individuals to monitor the actions of their colleagues, 

and to call attention to any issues .... Importantly, 

individuals would not be able to ﬁ
opt outﬂ of the firm as a way of escaping the problem. If a person knew that 

something is amiss and decided to leave the firm, their 

deferred debt compensation would still be at risk.ﬂ
The statute of limitations under the FIRREA is 10 years, 
meaning that annual deferral period should be 10 

years.
Please vote to protect shareholder value:

Clawback Amendment Š Proposal 8
BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 8The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders 
vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
JPMorgan Chase™s clawback provisions are broaderand more flexible than the proposed amendment,
are long-standing and they work.We maintain comprehensive recovery provisions that 
serve to hold executives accountable, when 

appropriate, for significant actions or items that 

negatively affect business performance in current or 

future years. The proposed policy would, by contrast, 

impose a monetary penalty, regardless of the 

responsibility of the individual officer.
To hold individuals responsible for taking risks 
inconsistent with the Firm™s risk appetite and to 

discourage future imprudent behavior, policies and 

procedures that enable us to take prompt and 

proportionate actions with respect to accountable 

individuals include:1. Reduction of annual incentive compensation (in full 
or in part);
2. Cancellation of unvested awards (in full or in part);

3. Recovery of previously paid compensation (cash 
and/or equity); and
4. Taking appropriate employment actions (e.g., 
termination of employment, demotion, negative 
rating). 
The precise actions we take with respect to accountable 

individuals are based on the nature of their 

involvement, the magnitude of the event and the 

impact on the Firm. 
In addition, clawback/recoupment provisions on both 
cash incentives and equity awards enable us to reduce 

or cancel unvested awards and recover previously paid 

compensation in certain situations. Clawbacks can be 

triggered by restatements, misconduct, performance-

related and/or risk-related concerns, and may cover 

both vested and unvested awards. 
94    JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.    2016 PROXY ST
ATEMENTPROPOSAL 8Table of Contents
JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.   
   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   95We have a history of invoking these clawback provisions 
to recover compensation and, where warranted, have 

publicly disclosed the details of such actions. In 2015, 

our Board went further in this regard and adopted a 

policy requiring public disclosure in the event the Firm 

recoups any incentive compensation from members of 

the Operating Committee or the Firm™s Controller.  
The proposed amendment, on the other hand, would 
impose clawbacks solely for a monetary penalty 

associated with a violation of law and does not 

contemplate recovery of compensation once it has 

been paid. Our clawback provisions and newly adopted 

clawback disclosure policy are described in detail 

beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement. 
Strong ownership and retention requirementsfurther strengthen the connection between
executives and shareholders.The majority of NEO variable compensation is in the 
form of JPMorgan Chase equity, and is subject to 

mandatory deferral until vesting. Under the PSU 

program introduced this year, PSU awards will vest 

after three years but will be subject to an additional 

two year holding period. In addition, members of the 

Operating Committee, including our NEOs, are subject 

to specific share ownership requirements that are 

designed to further enhance the alignment of their 

interests with those of our shareholders. A detailed 

description of our ownership guidelines and retention 

requirements is on page 60 of this proxy statement. 
Risk and control issues (including settlement
payments and fines) are integrated into our
compensation framework.To encourage a culture of risk awareness and personal 

accountability, we approach our incentive 

compensation arrangements through an integrated 

risk, finance, compensation and performance 

management framework applied at the Firm, regional, 

and line of business/corporate levels. The Firm 

conducts quarterly control forums to discuss material 

risk and control issues (including settlement payments 

and fines) that may result in a compensation pool or 

individual compensation impact. Significant 

governmental and regulatory actions ordinarily have a 

negative impact on relevant incentive compensation 
pools insofar as the determination of such pools, while 
not formulaic, involves consideration of risk and control 

issues (including settlement payments and fines), in 

addition to other performance considerations such as 

financial performance. A detailed description of our 

risk review process is provided under the heading ﬁHow 

do we address risk & control?ﬂ on page 61 of this proxy 

statement.
The proposed amendment is overly prescriptive
and would put JPMorgan Chase at a significant
competitive disadvantage in attracting and
retaining talent.The proposed policy would impose a monetary penalty, 

regardless of the responsibility of the individual officer. 

The policy would impose a 10-year deferral period that 

would hold officers at risk of excessively punitive action 

and is not consistent with peer practices. We believe 

the proposed policy would put the Firm at a 

competitive disadvantage in recruiting executive talent.
The Board of Directors recommends a 
vote 
AGAINST
 this proposal.

Executive compensation philosophy Š adopt a balanced executive compensation

reputation
Jing Zhao, 262 Altadena Circle, Bay Point, CA 94565, 
the holder of 40 shares of our common stock, has 

advised us that he intends to introduce the following 

resolution:
Resolved: shareholders recommend that JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. (the Firm) adopt an executive 

compensation philosophy with consideration of 

relevant social factors to improve the Firm™s ethical 

conduct and public reputation.
Supporting Statement

According to 2015 Proxy Statement, the Compensation 
& Management Development Committee (CMDC) 

ﬁassists the Board in its oversight of the Firm™s 

compensation programs and reviews and approves the 

Firm™s overall compensation philosophy and 

practicesﬂ (p.27). ﬁThe CMDC reviews and approves the 

Firm™s compensation philosophy, which guides how the 

Firm™s compensation plans and programs are 

designedﬂ. ﬁThe CMDC uses a disciplined pay-for-

performance framework to make executive 

compensation decisions ..., while considering other 

relevant factors, including market practicesﬂ (p.38). 

Such a philosophy without consideration of social 

factors guided the CMDC to award our CEO total 

compensation $27,701,709 in 2014, 135% increase 

from 2013 (p.58).
Meanwhile, according to Wall Street Journal: ﬁTwo fifths 
of the population of developed countries have gained 

little over recent decadesﬂ (OECD Says Rise in 

Inequality Is Hurting Growth, May 22-24, 2015). 

According to Thomas Piketty™s study 
Capital in the 
Twenty-First Century 
(The Belknap Press of Harvard 

University Press, 2014), ﬁthere is absolutely no doubt 

that the increase of inequality in the United States 

contributed to the nation™s financial 

instability.ﬂ (p.297) ﬁThe increase was largely the 

result of an unprecedented increase in wage inequality 

and in particular the emergence of extremely high 

remunerations at the summit of the wage hierarchy, 

particularly among top managers of large 

firms.ﬂ(p.298) ﬁThe financial professions are about 
twice as common in the very high income groups as in 

the economy overall.ﬂ (p.303) ﬁBecause it is objectively 

difficult to measure individual contributions to a firm™s 

output, top managers found it relatively easy to 

persuade boards and stockholders that they were 

worth the money, especially since the members of 

compensation committees were often chosen in a 

rather incestuous manner.ﬂ (p.510)
Many Americans agree with Senator Bernie Sanders: 
ﬁThe six largest financial institutions in this country 

today hold assets equal to about 60% of the nation™s 

gross domestic product. These six banks issue more 

than two-thirds of all credit cards and over 35 percent 

of all mortgages. They control 95 percent of all 

derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank 

deposits in the United States.ﬂ ﬁThese institutions have 

acquired too much economic and political power, 

endangering our economy and our political process.ﬂ 

ﬁOur banking system must be part of the productive, 

job-creating productive economy.ﬂ

(https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-

For the purpose of this proposal, the Board or the 
CMDC has the flexibility to select relevant social factors, 

such as economic condition, unemployment and 

average income.
BOARD RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL 9The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders

controls and further reinforcing our culture; enhancing 

the customer experience to deliver sustained 

performance; and investments in our people, including

In 2015, we launched the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a 

global think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich 

analyses for the public good. The Institute utilizes our 

data, augmented by firmwide expertise and market 

access, to provide insights on the global economy and 

offer innovative analyses to advance economic 

prosperity. For example, in 2015, the Institute released 

a report that analyzed anonymized transaction-level 

consumer data, focusing on fluctuations in income and 

consumption. The Institute™s study revealed that while 

U.S. households across the income spectrum 

experience financial volatility, most lack an appropriate 

financial buffer to weather these shocks. Harnessing 

the unique assets of the Firm and the power of big 

data, the Institute is explaining the global economy in a 

way that provides decision-makers with the necessary 

information to frame and address critical issues.
We hold executives accountable, when appropriate,
for significant actions or items that negatively

The precise actions we take with respect to accountable 

individuals are based on the nature of their

In addition, clawback/recoupment provisions on both 
cash incentives and equity awards enable us to reduce 

or cancel unvested awards and recover previously paid 

compensation in certain situations. Clawbacks can be 

triggered by restatements, misconduct, performance-

related and/or risk-related concerns, and may cover 

both vested and unvested awards. Our recovery 

provisions and clawback provisions are described in

attend the meeting and vote your shares in person 

after you have submitted voting instructions to the 

proxies, we recommend that you revoke or amend your 

prior instructions in the same way you initially gave 

them Š that is, by telephone, Internet, or in writing. 

This will help to ensure that your shares are voted the 

way you have finally determined you wish them to be 

voted.
BOARD RECOMMENDATIONSThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR 

each of the director nominees, FOR the advisory 

resolution to approve executive compensation, FOR 

ratification of the appointment of the independent 

registered public accounting firm, and AGAINST each 

shareholder proposal.
MATTERS TO BE PRESENTEDWe are not aware of any matters to be presented other 

than those described in the proxy statement. If any 

matters not described in the proxy statement are 

properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will use 

their own judgment to determine how to vote your 

shares. If the meeting is adjourned, the proxies can 

vote your common stock at the adjournment as well, 

unless you have revoked your proxy instructions.
HOW VOTES ARE COUNTEDA quorum is required to transact business at our annual 

meeting. Shareholders holding of record shares of 

common stock constituting a majority of the voting 

power of the stock of JPMorgan Chase having general 

voting power present in person or by proxy shall 

constitute a quorum. If you have returned valid proxy 

instructions or attend the meeting in person, your 

common stock will be counted for the purpose of 

determining whether there is a quorum, even if you 

abstain from voting on some or all matters introduced 

at the meeting. In addition, broker non-votes will be 

treated as present for purposes of determining whether 

a quorum is present (see ﬁNon-discretionary itemsﬂ on 

page 100 of this proxy statement).

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
Voting by record holders
 Š If you hold shares in your 
own name, you may either vote FOR, AGAINST, or 

ABSTAIN on each of the proposals. If you just sign and 

submit your proxy card without voting instructions, 

your shares will be voted FOR each director nominee, 

FOR the advisory resolution to approve executive 

compensation, FOR ratification of the appointment of 

the independent registered public accounting firm, and 

AGAINST each shareholder proposal.
Broker authority to vote
 Š If your shares are held in 
street name, follow the voting instructions you receive 

from your broker, bank, or other nominee. If you want 

to vote in person, you must obtain a legal proxy from 

your broker, bank or other nominee and bring it to the 

meeting along with the other documentation described 

below under ﬁAttending the annual meeting.ﬂ If you do 

not submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or 

other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee 

may still be permitted to vote your shares under the 

following circumstances:
Discretionary items Š
 The ratification of the 
appointment of the independent registered public 

accounting firm is a discretionary item. Generally, 

brokers, banks and other nominees that do not receive 

instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this 

proposal in their discretion.
Non-discretionary items Š
 The election of directors, 
advisory resolution to approve executive compensation, 

and approval of the shareholder proposals are non-

discretionary items and may not be voted on by 

brokers, banks or other nominees who have not 

received voting instructions from beneficial owners. 

These are referred to as ﬁbroker non-votes.ﬂ
Election of directors
 Š To be elected, each nominee 
must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the 

votes cast at the meeting in respect of his or her 

election. If an incumbent nominee is not elected by 

the requisite vote, he or she must tender his or her 

resignation, and the Board of Directors, through a 

process managed by the Governance Committee, will 

decide whether to accept the resignation at its next 

regular meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions 

will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes 

cast for this purpose.
Other proposals
 Š The affirmative vote of a majority 

of the shares of common stock present in person or 

by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal is 
required to approve all other proposals. In 

determining whether each of the other proposals has 

received the requisite number of affirmative votes, 

abstentions will be counted and will have the same 

effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal. Broker non-

votes will have no impact since they are not 

considered shares entitled to vote on the proposal.
COST OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATIONWe will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. In 

addition to soliciting proxies by mail, we expect that a 

number of our employees will solicit shareholders 

personally and by telephone. None of these employees 

will receive any additional or special compensation for 

doing this. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. 

to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of 

$50,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and 

expenses. We will, on request, reimburse brokers, 

banks, and other nominees for their expenses in 

sending proxy materials to their customers who are 

beneficial owners and obtaining their voting 

instructions.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   103Shareholder proposals and nominations for the 2017 annual meeting 
PROXY STATEMENT PROPOSALSUnder SEC rules, proposals that shareholders seek to 
have included in the proxy statement for our next 

annual meeting of shareholders (other than nominees 

for director) must be received by the Secretary of 

JPMorgan Chase not later than December 8, 2016. 
In addition, as discussed on page 33 of this proxy 
statement, our Board recently amended the Firm™s By-

laws by adding By-law Section 1.10, which provides for 

a right of proxy access. This By-law enables 

shareholders, under specified conditions, to include 

their nominees for election as directors in the Firm™s 

own proxy statement. Under By-law Section 1.10, a 

shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) who 

has continuously owned at least 3% of the Firm™s 

outstanding shares for at least three consecutive years 

may nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any 

event at least two directors) and have such nominee(s) 

included in the Firm™s proxy statement, if the 

shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the 

applicable requirements set forth in the Firm™s By-laws. 

Shareholders seeking to have one or more nominees 

included in the Firm™s 2017 proxy statement must 

deliver the notice required by the Firm™s By-laws, which 

notice must be received by the Secretary of JPMorgan 

Chase not later than December 8, 2016, and not earlier 

than November 8, 2016. The complete text of our By-

laws is available on our website at jpmorganchase.com, 

under Governance, which is under the About Us tab, or 

may be obtained from the Secretary. 
Shareholder proposals (including nominees for director 
pursuant to the Firm™s proxy access By-law) should be 

mailed to the Secretary at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Office 

of the Secretary, 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 

10017; a copy may be e-mailed to the Office of the 

Secretary at corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com.
OTHER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONSOur By-laws govern the submission of nominations for 

director or other business proposals that a shareholder 

wishes to have considered at a meeting of 

shareholders, but that are not included in JPMorgan 

Chase™s proxy statement for that meeting. Under our 

By-laws, nominations for director or other business 

proposals to be addressed at our next annual meeting 

may be made by a shareholder who is entitled to vote 

and who has delivered a notice to the Secretary of 

JPMorgan Chase not later than the close of business on 

February 16, 2017, and not earlier than January 17, 

2017. The notice must contain the information 

required by the By-laws.
These advance notice provisions are in addition to, and 
separate from, the requirements that a shareholder 

must meet in order to have a nominee or proposal 

included in the proxy statement.
A proxy granted by a shareholder will give discretionary 
authority to the proxies to vote on any matters 

introduced pursuant to the advance-notice By-law 

provisions described above, subject to applicable rules 

of the SEC.
Copies of our By-laws are available on our website at 
jpmorganchase.com, under Governance, which is under 

the About Us tab, or may be obtained from the 

Secretary.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT   
   105Overview of 2015 performance
1 The Firm™s financial condition and results of operations are 
discussed in detail in the Management™s discussion and 
analysis (ﬁMD&Aﬂ) section of the 2015 Annual Report. The 
Firm also reviews its business and priorities during an annual 
Investor Day, most recently held on February 23, 2016. The 

2015 Annual Report and presentation materials for the 
JPMorgan Chase 2016 Investor Day are available on our 
website at jpmorganchase.com under Investor Relations.
In this Appendix we summarize the 2015 priorities and 
achievements for the Firm and for each of the LOBs in 

relation to these priorities. 
In 2015, the Firm continued to adapt its strategy and 
financial architecture toward meeting regulatory and capital 
requirements and the changing banking landscape, while 
serving its clients and customers, investing in its businesses, 
and delivering strong returns to its shareholders. Importantly, 
the Firm exceeded all of its 2015 financial targets including 
those related to balance sheet optimization and managing its 
capital, its GSIB surcharge and expense.
JPMorgan Chase reported record full-year 2015 net income 
of $24.4 billion, and record earnings per share of $6.00, on 
net revenue on a managed basis of $96.6 billion. Net income 
increased by $2.7 billion compared with net income of $21.7 
billion in 2014. The increase in net income in 2015 was 
driven by lower taxes and lower noninterest expense, 
partially offset by lower net revenue and a higher provision 
for credit losses.
The Firm™s performance is highlighted by the following 
measures:
Return on equity (ﬁROEﬂ): ROE was 11% for the year, 
compared with 10% in the prior year, and return on tangible 
common equity (ﬁROTCEﬂ) was 13% for both 2015 and 
2014. Tangible book value per share was $48.13, an increase of 8% 
over the prior year. Total stockholders™ equity at December 
31, 2015, was $247.6 billion.

Fortress balance sheet: The Firm maintained its fortress 
balance sheet, ending 2015 with a strong Basel III Advanced 

Fully Phased-In common equity Tier 1 (ﬁCET1ﬂ) capital ratio 
of 11.6% and a supplementary leverage ratio (ﬁSLRﬂ) of 

6.5%. The Firm was compliant with the Fully Phased-in U.S. 
liquidity coverage ratio (ﬁLCRﬂ) and net stable funding ratio 

(ﬁNSFRﬂ), and had $496 billion of high quality liquid assets 

(ﬁHQLAﬂ) as of year-end 2015.
In 2015, the Firm provided credit and raised capital of $2.0 
trillion for its consumers, corporate clients, small businesses, 
nonprofit and government entities, including states, 
municipalities, hospitals and universities.
The Firm has substantially completed its business 
simplification agenda, exiting businesses, products or clients 
that were non-core, not at scale or not returning the 
appropriate level of return in order to focus on core activities 
for its core clients and reduce risk to the Firm. While the 

business simplification initiative impacted revenue grow
th in 2015, it did not have a meaningful impact on the Firm™s 

profitability. The Firm continues to focus on streamlining, 

simplifying and centralizing operational functions and 
processes in order to attain more consistencies and 
efficiencies across the Firm. To that end, the Firm continues 

to make progress on simplifying its legal entity structure, 
streamlining its Global Technology function, rationalizing its 
use of vendors, and optimizing its real estate location 

strategy.

deploying capital efficiently. We benefit from the product 
depth of the Firm, with our full service clients generating 8

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
Global Finance & TreasuryThe Global Finance organization executes finance and capital 
management and strategy. The organization drives the 
information, analysis and recommendations to provide clear 
strategic direction for business decisions, expense and capital 
discipline, enhanced controls, increased automation and 
transparency. The organization maintains strong financial 
reporting controls and accounting practices, measures the 
Firm™s absolute and relative performance, analyzes and 
monitors regulatory requirements in order to effectively 
manage the impact on the businesses, and financial risks 

through all environments. Global Finance leads firmwide 
capital strategy, management and implementation Œ including 

compliance with new regulations, the Firm™s successful CCAR 
submission, and Recovery and Resolution plans. The 
organization delivers relevant and transparent disclosures 
and leads comprehensive dialogue with investors, regulators 

and other key external constituents globally.
Multi-year priorities

Global Finance™s priorities are to continue the Firm™s 
fundamental objectives of maintaining strong financial 

discipline; guarding safety and soundness; driving business 

performance, growth, and returns; managing regulatory 

change and assisting in the Firm™s interaction with regulatory 

and supervisory authorities; and developing best-in-class 
management information systems.
Financial discipline
Maintaining strong financial discipline includes upholding 
world-class controls, sound accounting practices, delivering 

relevant and transparent disclosures and having best-in-class 
management information systems. Global Finance is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over the Firm™s financial reporting, including 

the processes and procedures used to prepare the financial 
statements filed with the SEC and with multiple regulators 
around the world. Global Finance and Treasury are key points 
of contact with investors, research analysts and the credit 
rating agencies in communicating the strategic direction of 
the Firm, providing management with shareholder views and 

perspectives and continually seeking to improve the quality of 
disclosure to all stakeholders. In addition, Global Finance 
plays a role within the LOBs in developing performance 
targets, equity levels and return metrics.
Safety and soundness
Maintaining a fortress balance sheet and having strong 
capital and liquidity are key elements of safety and soundness 
and require appropriate reserves, strong capital ratios, 

diverse funding sources and strong credit rating
s. These provide the Firm with the ability to withstand difficult stress 

events and the flexibility to deploy capital for investments in 

businesses, dividends, equity buybacks and acquisitions. 
During 2015, Global Finance led the Firm™s internal capital 
adequacy assessment process and provided the information 

and analyses to regulators to enable the Firm, in March 2015, 

to be in a position to increase its common stock dividend 
commencing in the second quarter and to continue its 
common equity repurchases. The Firm ended 2015 with 
Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In common equity Tier 1 
capital ratio of 11.6%. During 2016, the Firm expects the 
CET1 capital ratio calculated under the Basel III Standardized 

Approach to become its binding constraint and expects that, 
over the next several years, its Basel III common equity Tier 1 
capital ratio will be between 11% and 12.5%. In the longer 
term, management expects to maintain a minimum Basel III 

common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11%. Through Treasury, the 
Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach in order to optimize liquidity sources and 
uses for the Firm as a whole; monitor exposures; identify 

constraints on the transfer of liquidity among legal entities 
within the Firm; and maintain the appropriate amount of 
surplus liquidity as part of the Firm™s overall balance sheet 
management strategy. Importantly, Treasury works within the 
LOBs to manage and maintain appropriate liquidity and 
funding for each LOB.
Managing regulatory change
In partnership with the businesses, Global Finance is focused 
on maximizing returns while building excellent client 
franchises and relationships. In 2015, Global Finance 
continued to play an important role with other corporate 

functions and the Firm™s businesses in addressing new rules 

and regulations; assessing changes to accounting standards 
and implementing them to ensure greater transparency of 
disclosures; enhancing capital planning and stress testing 
frameworks; and interacting with regulators with respect to 
the Firm™s Recovery and Resolution Plans.
Driving performance and efficiencies
Global Finance provides information, analyses and 
recommendations to the businesses to improve results and 
drive strategic business decisions, while promoting innovation 
and streamlining processes across the organization. The 

organization conducts the financial budgeting process of the 
Firm, and tracks revenues and expenses against their targets 
and budgets. During 2015, Global Finance continued to 

enhance its management information and planning 

capabilities, its technology and financial control structure and 

develop information reporting systems, including the launch 
of a strategic initiative to improve data quality and integrate 
the Finance, Risk and Treasury infrastructure. The 
organization will continue to automate and increase 
granularity, transparency, speed, consistency and flexibility of 
our financial forecasting and reporting processes.
Leadership and mobility
In 2015, the Global Finance organization continued to 
manage a strong people and talent agenda including 
recruiting, management development, recognition, diversity, 
professional growth and mobility.

   2016 PROXY STATEMENT 
Notes on non-GAAP financial measures
1 In addition to analyzing the Firm™s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm™s results and the results of the lines of business 
on a ﬁmanagedﬂ basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm™s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP 
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-
equivalent (ﬁFTEﬂ) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 

managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess 
the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 

items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the 

lines of business.2 Tangible common equity (ﬁTCEﬂ), return on tangible common equity (ﬁROTCEﬂ), and tangible book value per share (ﬁTBVPSﬂ) are each non-
GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm™s common stockholders™ equity (i.e., total stockholders™ equity less preferred stock) less 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (ﬁMSRsﬂ)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE 

measures the Firm™s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm™s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at 
period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm™s use of equity.
3 The common equity tier 1 (ﬁCET1ﬂ) and Tier 1 capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the 

supplementary leverage ratio (ﬁSLRﬂ) under the U.S. final SLR rule, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by 

management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm™s capital position. For additional information on these 
measures, see Regulatory capital in the Capital Management section of Management™s discussion and analysis within JPMorgan Chase & Co.™s 

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
4 The CIB has presented its net income, ROE and overhead ratio for 2015 excluding legal expense and business simplification, all of which are 

non-GAAP financial measures. Such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for 
comparability with peers.
