1We do our best to manage and operate our company with a consistent set of 
business principles and core values.
First and foremost, this means always 
trying to do the right thing.It means continuing to focus on maintaininga fortress balance sheet, strong capital 
ratios and strong credit ratings. It means
being willing to sacrifice short-term growth
for long-term opportunity. During these 
turbulent times, this approach is vital.While we haven’t avoided every obstacle, we’re proud our clients have been able to
rely on our relative strength and stability
during these tough economic times.We will continue to provide creditworthy businesses of all sizes the capital and 
financial tools they need to drive growth.For individuals and families, we will continue to help with their credit, savings 
and investment needs. This means helping 
our customers put a roof over their heads, 
pay for their education and build their 
small businesses. And, as always, we will
adhere to safe and sound lending standards.With our core beliefs as our foundation, we will do our part to restore our financial
system, strengthen the vitality of our 
company and help move us all forward.As we move forward, we believe that shareholders will benefit as we 
do the right thing for our customers 
and the communities we serve.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 12In last year™s shareholder letter, I referred to the ﬁturbulenceﬂ and ﬁunprecedentedﬂ
nature of events that had taken place during the preceding months. We did not know

when the cycle would end or the extent of the damage it would cause. But we did know

that we had to ﬁprepare for a severe economic downturn.ﬂ Collectively, we resolved to

navigate through the tough conditions, to help our clients in every way we could and to

show leadership in the industry, as has been our legacy during times of crisis.
It is now a year later. What transpired was largely unprecedented and virtually incon-
ceivable. Our firm tried to meet every challenge, and, in the process, we distinguished

ourselves in our service to clients and communities. Although our financial results

were weak in absolute terms (but fairly good in relative terms), reflecting terrible

market conditions, I believeŠand I hope you agreeŠthat this year may have been one

of our finest. 
The way forward will not be easy. We do not know what the future will bring, but we do
know that it will require everyoneŠthe banks, the regulators and the government Š to

work together and get it right. As we prepare for a very tough 2009, with most signs 

pointing to continued deterioration of the economy, we still remain long-term optimists

about our future and that of our country. Whatever may come, we will meet the challenge.
In this letter, I will describe our 2008 performance by line of business and review the
many critical events of the previous year. I also will focus on where the industry went

wrong and what the implications for the future may be. I hope, after reading this letter,

you will share my confidence in our ability to build a stronger, more vibrant company 

for the future.
DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,
Jamie Dimon,Chairman and 

Chief Executive Officer

3I. REVIEW OF 2008 FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS RESULTS
JPMorgan Chase earned nearly $6 billion in 2008,down 64% from the $15 billion we earned in the prior
year. During a “normal” credit cycle and environment,
we should earn more than $15 billion. So clearly, this
was not a great year financially. Essentially, the year’s
financial results were marred by two issues, both of
which were highlighted as major risks in last year’s
letter. The first related to increasing credit costs, most-
ly for consumer and mortgage loans. The second
resulted from Investment Bank write-downs of more
than $10 billion, primarily from leveraged lending and
mortgage exposures. Throughout this financial crisis, we have benefitedfrom a fortress balance sheet. We started this year
with Tier 1 capital of 8.4% and ended it with 10.9%.
We increased credit loss reserves to $24 billion (up
almost $14 billion, including $4 billion related to
Washington Mutual (WaMu)). Even without the infu-
sion of government capital in the year’s final quarter,
our Tier 1 capital at year-end would have been 8.9%.
Across all other measures of capital, we have remained
relatively conservative. Although we did not anticipate 
all of the extraordinary events of the year, our strong
balance sheet, general conservatism and constant focus
on risk management served us well and enabled us to
weather this terrible environment.While we are disappointed with our 2008 financialresults, we have not lost sight of our important
achievements. We are extremely gratified that we were
able to grow and gain healthy market share in virtually
allof our businesses. And we never stopped investingin our systems and infrastructure and adding bankers,
branches and products. Regardless of what 2009 will bring, this emphasis onserving clients and growing our businesses will drive
our results for years to come.A. Results by Line of Business
The Investment Bank reported a loss of $1.2 billion 
Our Investment Bank (IB) had disappointing financialresults on an absolute basis but performed relatively
well compared with most of our competitors. The
results reflect a tough operating environment and suf-
fered from the aforementioned $10 billion in write-
downs on leveraged lending and mortgage-related
assets, partially related to the acquisition of Bear
Stearns. While those write-downs were painful, they
were among the lowest in our industry. Moreover, our
underlying business performed solidly, and in some
notable areas, it outperformed. Several core businesses
–Rates and Currencies, Commodities, Emerging

Markets and Credit Trading–reported record results.
We also were able to make significant progress acrossour IB business. At the end of May, we closed our acqui-
sition of Bear Stearns, which I will discuss in more detail
later in this letter. Throughout the year, we stayed com-
pletely focused on servicing our corporate and investor
clients, and in spite of the credit crisis, we continued to
be there for our clients when they needed our advice and
responsible capital support. J.P. Morgan was engaged in
nearly all of the largest and most complex deals of the
year, and we solidly established ourselves as the first call
for clients on their most important challenges. We try not to overemphasize market share tables orawards, but years of focus and discipline did lead to
some extraordinary industry recognition that is worth
noting. We earned our best rankings ever across the
league tables, finishing first in global investment bank-
ing fees; mergers and acquisitions; global syndicated
loans; debt; equity; and debt and equity-related trans-
actions–the only firm ever to finish No. 1 in all of

these categories in a given year. In our Markets busi-
nesses, client revenue increased 40% year-over-year, as
clients shifted more of their business to us in uncertain
times. In addition, J.P. Morgan received top awards
fromInternational Financing Review, Riskand FinancialNewsand received a leading number of distinctions inthe Greenwich Associates’ 2008 Quality Leader survey
–a record number of industry honors for us. 
68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 3As we move into 2009, we are not resting on our laurels. We know we operate in a risky business with
many tough competitors who inevitably will come
back strong–even if some currently are distracted. 

We also know that the investment banking business,
in many ways, will never be the same. Leverage will be
lower, and certain structured financial products will
likely cease to exist. But the fundamental business will
remain the same: advising corporations and investors,
raising capital, executing trades, providing research,
making markets, and giving our clients the best ideas
and the financing to make those plans a reality.Retail Financial Services reported net income of 
$880 million with an ROE of 5%
With $880 million in earnings, Retail FinancialServices (RFS) had a poor year overall. For its two 
primary businesses–Retail Banking and Consumer

Lending–it was a tale of two cities.
On the plus side, Retail Banking, which includesConsumer Banking and Business Banking, earned 
$3 billion and, more important, grew its franchise–

both organically and through the acquisition of
Washington Mutual. We expect the WaMu acquisition
to contribute more than $2 billion in annual earnings,
and it has extended our branch network to more than
5,000 branches in 23 states, adding 7,200 bankers and
increasing our ATMs to 14,500, the second-largest ATM
network nationally. In Retail Banking, since the Bank
One merger and the addition of The Bank of New York
and WaMu branch networks, we have exponentially
grown our footprint, adding 4,400 branches through
acquisition and 500 organically. This five-year expan-
sion is reflected in more checking accounts (from 2.3
million to 24 million), more deposits (from $89 billion
to $342 billion) and more states in which we operate
(from four to 23).On the negative side, Consumer Lending, whichincludes the Mortgage, Home Equity, Student Loan
and Auto Finance businesses, reported a loss of $2.1
billion, driven by a 274% increase, to $9.5 billion, in
the provision for credit losses, primarily in the home
lending businesses. Despite these losses, ConsumerLending remains core to what we do. It enables us to serve customers across many products and extend
$352 billion in loans. However, continued pressure 
on home prices, the effects of past poor underwriting
standards and the deepening recession have pushed
up, and, unfortunately, will continue to push up, credit
costs. Our current expectation is that quarterly charge-
offs for the Mortgage and Home Equity portfolios
could range from $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion (an
extremely high annualized loss rate of 3.5% to 5%). 
By the end of 2008, we had reserves of more than $8
billion across all of RFS, and, with the expectation of
higher charge-offs, we also expect to build additional
reserves in 2009. However, there is one area that has
shown an improving trend: third-party mortgage 
servicing. This business relies on scale and efficiency
and, including the addition of the WaMu portfolio, 
it grew 91% to $1.17 trillion of loans.We believe we have corrected for the underwritingmistakes of the past. Essentially, by the end of 2008,
we saw a return to old-fashioned home lending stan-
dards (a maximum of 80% loan-to-value, with fully
documented income). In addition, we closed down all 
business originated by mortgage brokers. My worst
mistake of the past several years was not doing this
sooner. In general, the credit losses in the broker-
originated business are two to three times worse 
than that of our own directly originated business.
Unfortunately, approximately 30% of our home loans
were originated through the broker channel. Although
we will be paying for this bad underwriting for years
to come, we will continue to build the Consumer
Lending business with new standards in place.We have always loved the Retail Banking business andbelieve that the exceptional economics of the branch-
based businesses will fuel growth and earn a return on
equity (ROE) of more than 30% over time. As for the
Consumer Lending business, it should produce returns
of 15%-20%, especially as we capitalize on the benefits
of cross-selling and cross-underwriting.468359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 4www.global-reports.com

an ROE of 5%
Card Services’ full-year net income was $780 million,down 73% year-over-year as charge-offs increased from
$5.5 billion in 2007 to $8.2 billion in 2008 (up 48%).The net charge-off rate was approximately 5% of loans.In 2008, Card Services increased net revenue by 8%
and grew managed loans by 3% (excluding WaMu). In 2008, we added 14.9 million new credit cardaccounts. By investing in activities to further engage
current cardmembers and attract new customers, we
continued growing the business. These activities
included renewing contracts with important partners(AARP, Continental, Disney, Marriott and United) andenhancing our customer service. Equally important,
Chase kept credit open and available to customers and
businesses in a safe and sound manner and extended
more than $84 billion in new credit. With the WaMu acquisition, Chase became the largestcredit card issuer in the nation, with more than 168
million cards in circulation and more than $190 billion
in managed loans. Yet, being the biggest does not
mean we are the best. We will continue to invest in
areas that will make us the best in the business.
Specifically, our focus will be on responsive customerservice, valued loyalty and rewards programs, and
upgraded systems and infrastructure. In addition, our
ability to do a better job underwriting and to give our
customers added value through cross-selling is a huge
competitive advantage in both the card and retail
banking businesses.Our focus on sound risk management extends to thecard business. Early in this crisis, we responded quick-
ly to leading indicators of change and made consider-
able risk management improvements. This included:
raising the credit-score threshold for direct-mail mar-keting and increasing the number of applications that
are subject to our thorough review process. We regu-
larly manage our customers’ credit lines, based ontheir willingness and ability to pay. While we are 
lowering credit lines for customers who show signs 
of increased risk or inactivity, we also are raising lines
for our most creditworthy customers. In addition, we
are closing accounts that have been inactive for long
periods of time because we know from experience thatthese accounts are extremely risky.Looking ahead, we expect losses will continue toincrease from 5% to 9%, essentially tracking the rate
of unemployment. To prepare for higher losses, we
increased our reserves from $3 billion to $8 billion and
are intensifying our collections efforts. At the same
time, we have expanded our use of flexible payment
programs to help those customers experiencing finan-
cial distress: In 2008, we saw 600,000 new enrollments
in payment programs, and we anticipate, and are prepared for, that number to increase. We do not expect 2009 to be a good year for the creditcard business. In fact, we do not expect to make any
money in Card Services this year. However, once this
crisis is over, we believe that our ongoing investments
in service quality, rewards programs and enhanced
infrastructure will ultimately make us one of the best
credit card companies in America.Earnings by Line of Business

with an ROE of 20%
Commercial Banking delivered strong results, outper-forming its peer group and even exceeding our 2008
plan in a tough year. Strong credit quality, risk management, client service, operational efficiency,expense control and effective pricing all contributed to
the strong result: a 27% increase to a record $1.4 bil-lion of net income, on a record $4.8 billion in revenue.
And instead of relying on lending to be the key driver
of revenue, Commercial Banking achieved record
results in gross investment banking revenue of $966
million (up 9%), treasury services revenue of $2.6 
billion (up 13%), average liability balances of $103.1 
billion (up 18%) and average loan balances of $82.3 
billion (up 35%). It also is notable that only 36% of
Commercial Banking’s revenue relates to loans.In addition to ranking among the top three commer-cial banks nationally in market penetration and lead
share and being the No. 2 large middle-market lender
in the United States, Commercial Banking maintained
a favorable market position relative to peers in risk
management and deposit growth. We also are encour-
aged by the prospects for the Commercial TermLending business we acquired from WaMu and the
expansion of our middle-market model across the
West and Southeast footprints. As ever, client selection
is critical to our success, and Commercial Banking has
not only created more than 1,800 new relationships but
also has expanded nearly 10,000 existing relationships
–a sign of the continued vitality of our business. 
That said, due to our clients’ waning loan demand andhigher credit losses, 2009 will be a tough year for the
Commercial Banking business. While we expect prob-
lems in commercial construction and real estate to
worsen for the rest of this year, we are fortunate tohave limited exposure and strong reserves. The turbu-
lence in the economy and its anticipated impact on the
broader Commercial Banking portfolio have led us toshift into a recession-management mode and dedicate
many of our best resources into critically important
workout units, where expert senior managers are
involved on a daily basis. Commercial Banking is a business with excellent long-term value for us. We play a critical role in serving so
many great companies across this nation. And as this
important and vibrant sector of the economy grows, 
so will we.Treasury & Securities Services reported record net income
of $1.8 billionTreasury & Securities Services (TSS) delivered excep-tional financial results in 2008. Its net income has more
than doubled since 2005. For 2008, it stands at $1.8 bil-lion (up 26%), with a 47% return on equity, on recordrevenue (up 17%). We value this business tremendously
and appreciate how it has grown consistently overtime, produced good margins, and maintained great
global scale and long-standing client relationships. The business maintains a leading position in holding,valuing, clearing and servicing securities and providing

7ucts, and trade finance services to the world’s leadingcompanies and institutional investors. We now serve
more than 2,800 clients around the world. In 2008, TSS brought in more than 250 significant new clientrelationships, representing more than $80 million in
annualized revenue. In a business with global scale,50% of TSS’ revenue is from business outside the
United States, and in 2008, this revenue grew by 
15%. TSS further strengthened its international 
presence, expanding services in more than 20 coun-
tries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, 
Asia and Latin America–we now do business in 

more than 45 countries. Notably, TSS also broke its single-day U.S. dollar-clearing volume record–by clearing a staggering $5

trillion in a single day, 59% over its average. Due to
market conditions, TSS assets under custody decreased
by 17% to $13.2 trillion. Yet, at the same time, average
liability balances were up 22% to $280 billion, reflect-
ing a flight to quality as clients were drawn to the 
stability of J.P. Morgan. TSS is preparing for continued stress in the equitymarkets in 2009, declining securities lending balances
and the negative impact of 0% interest rates.
Nevertheless, it remains an excellent business, serving
clients from all five of our other businesses, and we
expect it to produce strong results for years to come.Asset Management reported net income of $1.4 billion
with an ROE of 24%
Asset Management, with assets under supervision of$1.5 trillion, experienced a turbulent year in 2008. As
anticipated in this letter last year, earnings dropped(by 31%). But overall, the year’s results were the resultof three trends: continued strong growth in Private
Banking, a small reduction in assets under manage-ment (but a large change in the mix of asset types) 
and a rigorous management of risk.Private Banking had an exceptional year, bringing in arecord number of new clients and a record level of net
new assets (approximately $80 billion, for a total of$538 billion). Earnings grew 12%. Over the past twoyears, more than 235 new bankers have joined the
Private Bank and promise to contribute significantly 
to its future growth.Assets under management were $1.13 trillion at theend of 2008 versus $1.19 trillion in 2007. Net new
inflows were a healthy $151 billion, up 31% from the
prior year. Unfortunately, this was more than offset by
the declines in market values. In addition, there was alarge change in the mix of assets. The cash we manage
for all our clients increased dramatically, with liquidity
balances growing by $210 billion to reach $613 billion
by year-end, as clients globally sought safety away
from higher-risk investments. Equities and alternatives
went in the opposite direction, with a 49% decline to
$240 billion from $472 billion, largely due to a 41%
drop in the value of equity markets. Finally, alternative
assets dropped 17% to $100 billion from $121 billion.The current turmoil has reinforced the importance ofmanaging risk. Our culture of strong risk management
(proper due diligence, documentation, auditing, among
other measures) is consistent with our philosophy of
putting clients’ interests first and has enabled us to
avoid many of the negative developments that sur-
faced last year. We anticipate another difficult year in 2009, with earnings continuing to be affected by market condi-
tions. But this is a great business, and we intend to
keep it that way by focusing on helping our clientsthrough the current environment. The Corporate sector reported net income of $557 million
In 2008, we reported a net loss of $700 million in
Private Equity–a different story from 2007, when we

reported pre-tax private equity gains of more than $4billion. We love the private equity business, but as weindicated in prior years, private equity returns are by
their nature lumpy, and we did not expect the stellar2007 results to be repeated in 2008. We will remain
patient and still expect this business to deliver in
excess of 20% return on equity for us over time. 68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  1:42 PM  Page 78Aside from Private Equity, our Corporate sector,excluding merger-related items, produced $1.5 billion
in net income. This includes unallocated corporateexpense of approximately $500 million, which weexpect to continue at approximately the same level 
in 2009, as well as a myriad of other items that are disclosed in detail in our financial statements.B. Strong strategic positions of all our businesses
One important and critical point to highlight is thateach of our businesses now ranks as one of the top
three players in its respective industry. As ever, ourgoal is to be the best, not necessarily the biggest. Thatsaid, we know that size matters in businesses where
economies of scale–in areas such as systems, opera-
tions, innovation, branding and risk diversification–

can be critical to success. The only reason to get 
bigger and gain economies of scale is when doing so
enables you to do a better job for your clients; i.e., by
giving them more, better and faster at a lower cost.
Ultimately, this is also the only real reason to do a
merger–the client gets something better. If this isn’t

the case, big can be bad. If bureaucracy, hubris, lack of
attention to detail–or other ailments of large corpora-

tions–overwhelm the benefits of size, then failure will

ultimately result. We are also keenly aware of the value added at more
detailed levels in our businesses. For example, in 
Retail Financial Services, we gained share with small
businesses as we expanded our brand footprint. Our
Investment Bank has become a top player in bothPrime Brokerage and Energy, previously two of our
weak spots. Commercial Banking added WaMu’s
Commercial and Community Lending businesses 
to its portfolio, representing $44.5 billion in loans. And Private Banking’s record in net new asset flows
showed the strength of the J.P. Morgan franchise, as
high-net-worth individuals worldwide chose us to man-
age their investments. We also continue to upgradeour infrastructure by improving systems, data centers,
products and services.Suffice it to say, we like our market position andbelieve that each business is strong and getting
stronger. Even in tough years like 2008 and 2009, 
we did not–and will not–stop doing all the things

that make our businesses better. ManagedNet Revenue

9II. REVIEW OF CRITICAL EVENTS OF 
THE YEARIn this section, I want to review some of the criticalevents for us this past year:•The purchase of Bear Stearns 

•The purchase of Washington Mutual

•The gathering storm that arrived with a vengeance 

•The acceptance of government TARP
A. The purchase of Bear Stearns
On May 30, 2008, we closed our acquisition of BearStearns–a deal completed in record time under truly

extraordinary circumstances. Over the weekend of March 15, we were asked by theU.S. government to assist in preventing Bear Stearns
from going bankrupt before the opening of the Asian
markets on Monday morning. The possibility was real
that if Bear Stearns had been allowed to go bankrupt, 
it could have had a cataclysmic effect on the financial
markets. (Many believe that later experiences with
Lehman Brothers essentially proved this to be true.) To
a person, our Board of Directors felt JPMorgan Chase
had a special obligation to do all we could to help, espe-
cially knowing that we were among the few companies
–if not the only one–in a position to do so. However,

this deal posed more risks and threatened to be more
backbreaking than any other acquisition we had done in
the past. And it had to make sense for our shareholders. Going into this deal, we had two things in our favor:the strength of our balance sheet and capital base and
the skill of our people. Our first priority was to quickly reduce our downsiderisk. This required us to massively de-risk Bear Stearns
quickly and in potentially dangerous markets. Bear
Stearns had approximately $400 billion in assets that 
we needed to consolidate into our financial and risk sys-
tems and reduce quickly to approximately $200 billion
of assets. We had to manage this reduction so that the
remaining risk was manageable and well-controlled. The
potential downside–given the treacherous markets–

was enormous. We asked the government to finance
and assume the risk on approximately $30 billion ofmortgage assets (compared with our $370 billion of totalassets acquired from Bear Stearns). The portion that 
the government agreed to take comprised the less risky
mortgage assets (we kept the most risky mortgage
assets). We simply could not and would not take on 
any more mortgage risk–it would have been extremely

irresponsible. And remember, the government could
finance the assets much more cheaply than we could
and could hold them as it saw fit, whereas we would
have been forced to sell them immediately. Under normal conditions, the price we ultimately paidfor Bear Stearns would have been considered low by
most standards. But these were not normal conditions,
and because of the risk we were taking, we needed a
huge margin for error. We were not buying a house–

we were buying a house on fire. We paid $1.5 billion for Bear Stearns, a company thathad reported a little more than $11 billion in common
equity. We knew that most–but we hoped not all–of

the common equity we were buying would be used for
close-down costs, litigation expenses, severance costs
and, most important, quickly eliminating the risk on the
balance sheet. We have largely completed this task, but,
unfortunately, all of the equity was used up in this
process, and several billions more in losses ran through
our income statement in the second half of 2008. Despite these additional costs, we still believe that Bear Stearns has added significantly to our franchise.
In particular, it completed our franchise in two 
areas where we were weak, Prime Brokerage and
Commodities, and it enhanced our broader equity and
fixed income businesses. Ultimately, we expect the
businesses we acquired to add approximately $1 billion
of annual earnings to the company. The truly impressive part of the Bear Stearns deal wasthe human side–seeing our people rise to the chal-

lenge under a great deal of strain. On Thursday night,
March 13, I called our investment banking heads, Steve
Black and Bill Winters, who then called our finance,
audit, tax, trading and banking professionals as well as
legal, real estate and systems teams around the world–

many of whom got out of bed and went back to work.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 910Soon, hundreds returned to work that night. By theweekend, thousands of people from around the world
were working around the clock. These professionalsably managed the due diligence work and gave us theconfidence we needed to complete the deal. Their
Herculean effort over that weekend and the next sever-al months made it possible for us to sign and close the
deal in about 75 days. If you could have seen what I
saw during that intensely stressful time, you would
have been very proud of the team at JPMorgan Chase.B. The purchase of WaMu
On September 25, the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC) seized the banking assets of
Washington Mutual in the largest bank failure in history. Moments later, we acquired the deposits,assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual 
for approximately $1.9 billion. We now know thatJPMorgan Chase was the only bank prepared to act
immediately. We acquired WaMu’s 2,200 branches,
5,000 ATMs and 12.6 million checking accounts, as
well as savings, mortgage and credit card accounts.
Importantly, we did not acquire the assets or liabilities
of the bank’s holding company or assume the $14 
billion of senior unsecured debt and subordinated 
debt of Washington Mutual’s banks.The deal was financially compelling–it was immedi-
ately accretive to earnings, and it will add an estimated
$2 billion or 50 cents per share to our 2009 results and
increasingly more thereafter. To achieve these antici-
pated earnings, we did not rely on heroic revenue
assumptions. Instead, we mostly relied on expected
cost savings (net of the large investments in the 
technology and refurbishment of the branches) of $1.5
billion. We now expect to achieve cost savings of morethan $2 billion. We also plan to complete all rebrand-
ing and system conversions by the end of this year. With the acquisition of WaMu, we purchased approxi-mately $240 billion of mortgage and mortgage-related
assets, with $160 billion in deposits and $38 billion in
equity. We immediately wrote down most of the bad
or impaired assets (approximately $31 billion), proper-ly reserved for the remaining assets, and establishedreserves for severance and close-down costs. After 
recognizing all of these costs, we believe that we now
have a relatively “clean” company that came with
approximately $4 billion in “good” common equity. Our due diligence on WaMu’s assets was extensive,and our assumptions were conservative. We assumedthat home prices would go down another 10% (from
the day we closed), providing a healthy margin for
error. However, if home prices go down more than
expected, say 20%, all other things being equal, thiscould cost us $5 billion-$10 billion more. Even under
these circumstances, we think the transaction will
remain a great deal, at a great price for our sharehold-
ers. We are confident that it will add enormous valueto JPMorgan Chase in the future.Given our conservative nature, we sold $11.5 billion incommon stock the morning after the deal announcement
to maintain our strong capital base. The capital raise–
upsized due to strong response from investors–was the

largest U.S. common stock follow-on offering ever exe-
cuted. In addition, WaMu’s retail deposits contributed 
to our stable funding base and liquidity position. In prior years, we consistently expressed our desire tobroaden our retail footprint to attractive regions such
as the West Coast and Florida–as long as the plan

made good sense financially and we could execute the
transaction effectively. The WaMu transaction aligned
perfectly with this criteria. Specifically, it expands our
retail franchise into fast-growing new markets with
established branches; bolsters our presence in our 
significant footprint states; and, over time, will allow
us to extend the reach of our commercial banking,
business banking, credit card and wealth managementefforts. These additional businesses were not heritage
strengths of WaMu but, in effect, can be built on top
of the WaMu branches and we hope eventually will
add another $500 million to our earnings (this will
take many years and was not built into our original
assumptions). An expanded product line, together 
with enhanced systems, will benefit former WaMu 
customers tremendously.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  1:42 PM  Page 10www.global-reports.com
11Our people across the business–together with our
experts in systems, marketing, legal, finance, audit and
human resources–did an outstanding job executing
this transaction, making it possible for us to take thisimportant strategic step. C. The gathering storm arrived with a vengeance Ñ
and how JPMorgan Chase fared
In 2008, Bear Stearns collapsed; Lehman Brothersdeclared bankruptcy; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
were placed into government conservatorship; thegovernment assumed majority ownership of AIG;Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America; Wells
Fargo took over a struggling Wachovia; IndyMac andWaMu went into receivership by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation; Countrywide and the U.S.
mortgage business virtually collapsed; the two remain-
ing major investment banks, Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley, became bank holding companies;
around the globe, French, British, Swiss and German
banks were rescued by their governments; and the
world entered the sharpest, most globalized downturn
since the Great Depression.As for JPMorgan Chase, we had large credit and opera-tional exposures in virtually every situation mentioned
above, affecting nearly every line of business. Our
firm’s management teams, credit officers, risk officers,
and legal, finance, audit and compliance teams worked
tirelessly to protect the company. We believe it is a
considerable sign of strength that we could managethrough such extraordinary problems with minimal
losses to the company. We avoided many critical problems that would have
made things far worseIn last year’s letter, we focused on our problems–
including mortgage issues in Retail Financial Services
and write-downs in the Investment Bank of leveragedloans and mortgage securities. Those issues cost us aconsiderable amount of money in 2008 and will contin-
ue to cost us money in 2009. But it also is instructiveto focus on how we were able to avoid certain prob-
lems, control the damage and minimize the cost. In 2008:•We essentially stayed away from sponsoring struc-
tured investment vehicles (SIV) because we viewedthem as arbitrage vehicles with plenty of risk and a
limited business purpose. We also minimized our
financing to SIVs for the same reasons, and back in
2005, we sold the only small SIV we had sponsored. •We didn’t write option ARMs (adjustable rate 
mortgages) because we did not think they were a
consumer-friendly product. Although we made 
plenty of mistakes in the mortgage business, this
was not one of them.•We substantially cut back on subprime early in the
crisis. While subprime mortgages cost us nearly $1billion in 2008, we avoided far worse results because
we had significantly reduced our exposures in 2006.
This was true both in the mortgage business and in
the Investment Bank. •We never built up the structured finance business.
While we are a large player in the asset-backed 
securities market, we deliberately avoided the struc-
tured collateralized debt obligation (CDO) business
because we believed the associated risks were too
high. Structured finance in its most complicated
forms, such as “CDO-squared,” has largely disap-
peared after unleashing a myriad of problems on 
the financial system. They will not be missed.•We did not unduly leverage our capital, nor did we
rely on low-quality forms of capital. We always hadhigh targets of 8% to 8.5% Tier 1 capital. We always
believed in “high-quality” capital, which, among
other things, means conservative accounting, strong
loan loss reserves and a high component of tangiblecommon equity. The higher the quality of capital,
the more prepared one is for tough times. •We maintained a high level of liquidity–and were
always prepared for unexpected draws (i.e., collateralcalls). Strong liquidity is a constant for us. The fact
that we have total deposits of $1 trillion across ourretail and wholesale businesses positions the firm
advantageously overall and has helped us weather68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  1:42 PM  Page 1112the worst of the crisis. We will do whatever it takesto ensure that our liquidity remains a strong part of
our fortress balance sheet so that we can maintain
flexibility during challenging times to be in a posi-
tion to support our clients.•We avoided short-term funding of illiquid assets,
and we essentially do not rely on wholesale funding.
(Of our $1 trillion of deposits, approximately $300
billion is referred to as “wholesale,” but it essentially
is comprised of deposits that corporate clients leave
with us in the normal course of business–i.e., they

are “sticky” and not like brokered certificates of
deposit or “hot money” that move on a whim for one
basis point.) Simply put, we still follow the financial
commandment: Do not borrow short to invest long.D. The acceptance of government TARP
On October 13, 2008, I went to Washington, D.C., witheight chief executives of other financial firms. There,
we were asked by the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FDIC and the
New York Federal Reserve Bank to agree to accept a
package of capital from the government. As part of its
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the U.S. gov-
ernment was proposing some powerful measures to
help fix the collapse in the credit and lending markets.They prevailed upon the nine of us to set an examplefor others by accepting this capital infusion as a sign
of our unanimous support of these measures. The logic
was that a massive infusion of capital into the U.S.
banking system would pave the way for the industry
as a whole to extend more credit than they otherwise
would have provided. The government’s view was also
that if any of the banks declined the TARP funds, then
many of the additional banks might not want to be
tainted by their acceptance of the TARP money
because it might be viewed as a sign of weakness.We felt then that accepting the TARP funds was the right
thing to do for the U.S. financial system Œeven though it

may not have been as beneficial for JPMorgan Chase as

it was for some of the others
In short, we did not ask for the TARP capital infusion,and we did not feel we needed it (our Tier 1 capital at
year-end would have been 8.9% without it). In fact, 
the TARP program had asymmetric benefits to those
accepting it; i.e., it was least beneficial to strong com-
panies like ours and vice versa. That said, we believe
that accepting the TARP funds was the right thing to
do for the U.S. financial system–and that JPMorgan

Chase should not be parochial or selfish and stand in
the way of actions that the government wanted to take
to help the whole financial system.7.58.08.59.07.06.59.510.0200420052007

13We think the government acted boldly in a very tough
situation, the outcome of which could have possibly been

far worse had it not taken such stepsThe government acted quickly and boldly–taking
unorthodox steps to try to right the ship. It had to act
with urgency while dealing with complex and rapidlychanging problems that did not lend themselves tosimplistic solutions. While we will never actually
know, we believe, as many economists and analysts do,that without these and other actions the government
has taken to date, things could have been much worse.So while it is easy to criticize the timing, marketing orconsistency of the effort–we also recognize how hard

it is to act boldly in difficult and dangerous times. Weshould remind ourselves of what President TheodoreRoosevelt expressed nearly a century ago: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who pointsout how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer ofdeeds could have done them better. The credit belongs
to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is
marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcom-
ing; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who
knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; whospends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best
knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and
who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring
greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold
and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” We hope that our leaders will continue to be bold
and brave in seeking solutions to these once-in-a-
generation problems.Banks are lending, and the TARP is probably helping
It is important to recognize that TARP capital is only14% of our total capital. It is also important to recog-
nize that to the extent we use the money and lose it,the risk is 100% ours because we still owe the moneyback to the government. Despite that, we, and other
banks, are trying to use TARP capital to benefit share-holders, clients and communities. In the fourth quarter
of 2008 alone, we extended more than $150 billion in
new credit to consumers, businesses, municipalities
and not-for-profit organizations, including nearly $30 
billion in home lending and $2.8 billion in auto lend-
ing. We increased loans and commitments to govern-
ment units, health care companies and not-for-profits
by 33% in 2008 and plan to increase lending to these
groups by $5 billion in 2009. We also completed sever-
al major syndicated leveraged finance loans, and, in
one critical instance, we bought the entire $1.4 billion
bond issue from the state of Illinois when no one 
else would bid for it, giving Illinois the financing for 
payroll and other important needs. Finally, we remain
very active in the interbank market (where banks lend
to each other) and have had on average $40 billion to
$50 billion out in the interbank market each night. While total lending by banks fluctuates according tothe markets and changing credit conditions, we do
believe that TARP has enabled many banks to increase
their lending in certain key areas–more than they 

otherwise would have done.While we clearly understood that there might be potential (mostly political) unintended consequences 
of TARP, we believed that it would help the U.S. 
financial system at that critical moment.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  6:17 PM  Page 1314III. FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FINANCIAL 

CRISISAfter Lehman’s collapse, the global financial systemwent into cardiac arrest. There is much debate over
whether Lehman’s crash caused it–but looking back, 

I believe the cumulative trauma of all the aforemen-
tioned events and some large flaws in the financial 
system are what caused the meltdown. If it hadn’t 
been Lehman, something else would have been the
straw that broke the camel’s back.The causes of the financial crisis will be written about,analyzed and subject to historical revisions for decades.
Any view that I express at this moment will likely 
be proved incomplete or possibly incorrect over time.
However, I still feel compelled to attempt to do so
because regulation will be written soon, in the next
year or so, that will have an enormous impact on our
country and our company. If we are to deal properly
with this crisis moving forward, we must be brutally
honest and have a full understanding of what caused 
it in the first place. The strength of the United States
lies not in its ability to avoid problems but in our 
ability to face problems, to reform and to change. So 
it is in that spirit that I share my views.Albert Einstein once said, “Make everything as simpleas possible, but not simpler.” Simplistic answers or
blanket accusations will lead us astray. Any plan for
the future must be based on a clear and comprehen-
sive understanding of the key underlying causes of–

and multiple contributors to–the crisis, which

include the following:•The burst of a major housing bubble 
•Excessive leverage pervaded the system

•The dramatic growth of structural risks and 
the unanticipated damage they caused•Regulatory lapses and mistakes

•The pro-cyclical nature of virtually all policies,
actions and events •The impact of huge trade and financing imbalances
on interest rates, consumption and speculationEach main cause had multiple contributing factors. As I wrote about these causes, it became clear to me
that each main cause and the related contributors
could easily be rearranged and still be fairly accurate.It was also surprising to realize that many of themain causes, in fact, were known and discussed abun-
dantly before the crisis. However, no one predicted
that all of these issues would come together in the
way that they did and create the largest financial and
economic crisis of our lifetime.Even the more conservative of us, and I considermyself to be among them, looked at the past major
crises (the 1974, 1982 and 1990 recessions; the 1987 and
2001 market crashes) or some mix of them as the worst-
case events for which we needed to be prepared. We
even knew that the next one would be different–but

we missed the ferocity and magnitude that was lurking
beneath. It also is possible that had this crisis played
out differently, the massive and multiple vicious cycles
of asset price reductions, a declining economy and a
housing price collapse all might have played out differ-
ently–either more benignly or more violently. 
It is critical to understand that the capital marketstoday are fundamentallydifferent than they were afterWorld War II. This is not your grandfather’s economy.
The role of banks in the capital markets has changed 
considerably. And this change is not well-understood–in

fact, it is fraught with misconceptions. Traditional banks
now provide only 20% of total lending in the economy
(approximately $14 trillion of the total credit provided 
by all financial intermediaries). Right after World War II,
that number was almost 60%. The other lending has 
been provided by what many call the “shadow banking”
system. “Shadow” implies nefarious and in the dark, but
only part of this shadow banking system was in the dark
(i.e., SIVs and conduits)–the rest was right in front of us.

Money market funds, which had grown to $4 trillion of
assets, directly lend to corporations by buying commercial
paper (they owned $700 billion of commercial paper).
Bond funds, which had grown to approximately $2 tril-
lion, also were direct buyers of corporate credit and secu-
ritizations. Securitizations, which came in many forms
(including CDOs, collateralized loan obligations and 68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 14www.global-reports.com
15commercial mortgage-backed securities), either directly orindirectly bought consumer and commercial loans. Asset
securitizations simply were a conduit by which invest-
ment and commercial banks passed the loans onto the
ultimate buyers. In the two weeks after the Lehman bankruptcy, moneymarket and bond funds withdrew approximately $700billion from the credit markets. They did this becauseinvestors (i.e., individuals and institutions) withdrew
money from these funds. At the same time, bank lend-
ing actually went up as corporations needed to increas-
ingly rely on their banks for lending. With this as a
backdrop, let’s revisit the main causes of this crisis in
more detail.A. The burst of a major housing bubble
U.S. home prices have been appreciating for almost 
10 years–essentially doubling over that time. While

some appreciation is normal, the large appreciation, 
in this case, and the ultimate damage it caused were
compounded by the factors discussed below. New and poorly underwritten mortgage products 
(i.e., option ARMs, subprime mortgages) helped fuel 

asset appreciation, excessive speculation and far higher

credit losses
As the housing bubble grew, increasingly aggressiveunderwriting standards helped drive housing price
appreciation and market speculation to unprecedented
levels. Poor underwriting standards (including little or
no verification of income and loan-to-value ratios as
high as 100%) and poorly designed new products (like
option ARMs) contributed directly to the bubble and
its disastrous aftermath. Mortgage securitization had two major flaws
In many securitizations, no one along the chain, from
originator to distributor, had ultimate responsibility for
the resultsof the underwriting. In addition, the poorlyconstructed tranches of securitizations that comprised
these transactions effectively converted a large portion
of poorly underwritten loans into Triple A-rated securi-ties. Clearly, the rating agencies also played a key rolein this flawed process. These securitizations ended up
in many forms; the one most discussed is CDOs.
Essentially, these just added a lot more fuel to the fire.While most people are honorable, excess speculation and
dishonesty were far greater than ever seen before, on the

part of both brokers and consumers
The combination of no-money-down mortgages, specu-lation on home prices, and some dishonest brokers 
and consumers who out-and-out lied will cause damage
for years to come. This, in no way, absolves the poor
underwriting judgments made by us and other institu-
tions, and it certainly doesn’t absolve anyone who 
mis-sold loans to consumers.B. Excessive leverage pervaded the system
Over many years, consumers were adding to their 
leverage (mostly as a function of the housing bubble),
some commercial banks increased theirs, most of the
U.S. investment banks dramatically increased theirs 
and many foreign banks had the most leverage of all. 
In addition, increasing leverage appeared in:•Hedge funds, many using high leverage, grew dra-
matically over time. Some of that leverage was the
result of global banks and investment banks lending
them too much money.•Private equity firms were increasingly leveraging up
their buyouts. Again, some banks and the capital
markets lent them too much money.•Some banks (and other entities) added to their lever-
age by using off-balance sheet arbitrage vehicles, like
SIVs and leveraged puts.•Nonbank entities, including mortgage banks, CDO
managers, consumer and commercial finance compa-
nies, and even some bond funds, all increased their
leverage over time.•Even pension plans and universities added to their
leverage, often in effect, by making large “forward-
commitments.”Basically, the whole world was at the party, high onleverage–and enjoying it while it lasted.
68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 1516C. The dramatic growth of structural risks and the
unanticipated damage they caused 
I believe there are four structural risks or imbalancesthat grew and coalesced to cause a “run on the bank.”
But this was not a traditional bank run–it was a run
on our capital markets, the likes of which we had neverexperienced. After Lehman’s bankruptcy, many parts
of our capital markets system stopped providing anycapital to the market at all. If the crisis had unfolded
differently, then perhaps the events that followed
would not have occurred. Surely no one deliberately
built a system with these fundamental flaws and imbal-
ances. Clearer heads will understand that much of this
was not malfeasance–our world had changed a lot and

in ways that we didn’t understand the full potential
risk. But when the panic started, it was too much for
the system to bear.Many structures increasingly allowed short-term 
financing to support illiquid assets 
In essence, too much longer-term, non-investmentgrade product was converted into shorter-term Triple
A-rated product. Some banks, hedge funds, SIVs andCDOs were using short-term financing to support illiq-uid, long-term assets. When the markets froze, these
entities were unable to get short-term financing. As aresult, they were forced to sell these illiquid assets.
One of the functions of banking and the capital mar-
kets is to intermediate between the needs of investors
and issuers. This triggers a normal conversion, either
directly or indirectly (through securitizations) of
longer-term, illiquid assets held by the issuers, who
need to finance the business into the shorter-term, 
higher-grade product that most investors want. Clearly,
over time, this imbalance had grown too large and
unsupportable.Money market funds had a small structural risk, which
became a critical point of failure
Money market funds promise to pay back 100% to theinvestor on demand. Many money market funds invest-ed in 30- to-180-day commercial paper or asset-backedsecurities that under typicalcircumstances could besold back at par. In normal times, investors demandedtheir money in fairly predictable ways, and funds were
able to meet their demands. Over time, money market
funds grew dramatically to exceed $4 trillion. After
Lehman collapsed, one money fund in particular,
which held a lot of Lehman paper, was unable to meet
the withdrawal demands. As word of that situation
spread, investors in many funds responded by demand-
ing their money. In a two-week period, investors pulled
$500 billion from many money funds, which were
forced to sell assets aggressively. To raise liquidity,
these money funds essentially were forced to sell
assets. As investors moved away from credit funds and
into government funds, the banks simply were unable
to make up the difference. This became one more huge
rupture in the dike.Repo financing terms got too loose,and too many illiquid
assets were repo™ed
Over time, in those markets where financial companiesfinanced their liquid assets, financial terms had
become too lax. For example, to buy non-agency mort-gage securities, financial institutions only had to putup 2%-5% versus a more traditional 15%-25%. The
repo markets also had begun to finance fairly esotericsecurities, and when things got scary, they simply
stopped doing so. In the two weeks after Lehman’s
bankruptcy, more than $200 billion was removed from
this type of financing, by both investors and banks.
Once again, financial institutions had to liquidate 
securities to pay back short-term borrowing–thus,

another rupture in the dike.Investors acted wisely to protect themselves, but the system
couldn™t handle them all doing it at the same time
Individual investors, corporations, pension plans, bondand loan funds, money market funds and others–all

acted in their own self-interest, and all individuallyacted wisely. But collectively, they caused enormousflows out of the banking and credit system. Regardless
of whether the funds came out of a bank, a moneyfund, or a bond or loan fund, the fact remains that the
cumulative result was a severe shortage of necessary
credit that was removed from the system. 68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  1:42 PM  Page 16www.global-reports.com
17Clearly, things had changed. In the past, regulators hadfocused on preventing a systemic collapse of the main
intermediaries in the financial system; i.e., the banks.
In this new world, however, we need to discuss how to
protect ourselves not only from runs on banks but also
from runs on other critical vehicles in the capital and
financial markets.D. Regulatory lapses and mistakes
With great hesitation, I would like to point out that
mistakes also were made by the regulatory system.
That said, I do not blame the regulators for what hap-
pened. In each and every circumstance, the responsibili-
ty for a company’s actions rests with us, the CEO and
the company’s management. Just because regulators 
let you do something, it does not mean you should do 
it. But regulators have a responsibility, too. And if we
are ever to get this right, it is important to examine
what the regulators could have done better. In many
instances, good regulation could have prevented some of
the problems. And had some of these problems not hap-
pened, perhaps things would not have gotten this bad.Unregulated or lightly regulated parts of the market 
contributed to the crisis
I’ve already discussed some of the flaws with moneymarket funds and hedge funds–the latter were not 

regulated, and the former were lightly regulated. In
addition, there are two large segments, among others,
that–had they been regulated–could have helped the

system avoid some problems.•Much of the mortgage business was largely unregulat-
ed. While the banks in this business were regulated,
most mortgage brokers essentially were not. In fact,
no major commercial bank that was regulated by the
OCC wrote option ARMs (possibly the worst mort-
gage product). A very good argument could be made
that the lower standards of the unregulated parts of
the business put a lot of pressure on those players 
in the regulated part of the business to reduce their
standards so they could compete. In this case, bad
regulation trumped good regulation. •Insurance regulators essentially missed the large 
and growing one-sided credit insurance and credit
derivative bets being made by AIG and the monoline
insurers. This allowed these companies to take huge
one-sided bets, in some cases, by insuring various
complex mortgage securities.Basel II, which was adopted by global banks and U.S.
investment banks, allowed too much leverage
It is quite clear now that the second of the Accords bythe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (known
as Basel II), published in 2004, was highly flawed. It
was applied differently in different jurisdictions,
allowed too much leverage, had an over-reliance on
published credit ratings and failed to account for how a
company was being funded (i.e., it allowed too much
short-term wholesale funding). In 2004, the five inde-
pendent U.S. investment banks adopted Basel II under
the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (this was not allowed by the banks regu-
lated by the Federal Reserve or the OCC, which
remained under Basel I). The investment banks jetti-
soned prior conservative net capital requirements and
greatly increased their leverage under Basel II. And the
rest is history. Perhaps the largest regulatory failure of all time was the
inadequate regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
The extraordinary growth and high leverage of FannieMae and Freddie Mac were well-known. Many talked
about these issues, including their use of derivatives.
Surprisingly, they had their own regulator, which clear-
ly was not up to the task. These government-sponsored
entities had grown to become larger than the Federal
Reserve. Both had dramatically increased their leverage
over the last 20 years. And, amazingly, a situation was
allowed to exist where the very fundamental premise
of their credit was implicit, not explicit. This should
never happen again. Their collapse caused damage to
the mortgage markets and the financial system. And,
had the Treasury not stepped in, it would have caused
damage to the credit of the United States itself.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 1718Too many regulators Œ with overlapping responsibilities
and inadequate authorities Œ were ill-equipped to handle

the crisis Our current regulatory system is poorly organized andarchaic. Overlapping responsibilities have led to a dif-
fusion of responsibility and an unproductive competi-
tion among regulators, which probably accelerated a
race to the bottom. Many regulators also did not have
the appropriate statutory authority (through no fault 
of their own) to deal with some of the problems they
were about to face. One large, glaring example revealed
by the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman was the
lack of a resolution process in place to deal with failure
of investment banks. If commercial banks fail, the
FDIC can take them over. This was not the case with
investment banks. In addition, a resolution process
needs to be in place for large, global financial compa-
nies that operate in many jurisdictions and use many
different regulatory licenses. E. The pro-cyclical nature of virtually all policies,
actions and events 
In a crisis, pro-cyclical policies make things worse. Icannot think of one single policy that acted as a coun-
terbalance to all of the pro-cyclical forces. Although
regulation can go only so far in minimizing the impact
of pro-cyclical forces in times of crisis, we still must be
aware of the impact they have. For example:•Loan loss reserving causes reserves to be at their
lowest level right when things take a turn for the
worse. Therefore, as a crisis unfolds, a bank not only
faces higher charge-offs but also has to add to its
level of reserves, depleting precious capital.•Although we are proponents of fair value accounting
in trading books (a lot of the mark-to-market losses
that people complained about will end up being real
losses), we also recognize that market levels resulting
from large levels of forced liquidations may not
reflect underlying values. Certain applications of 
fair value accounting can contribute to a downward
spiral where losses deplete capital, and lower capital
causes people to respond by selling more, at increas-
ingly lower values. •The rating agencies made mistakes (like the rest of
us) that clearly helped fuel a CDO and mortgage
debacle. They also, in the midst of a crisis, continual-
ly downgraded credits. Lower ratings, in turn,
required many financial institutions to raise more
capital, thus adding to the vicious cycle. •In bad times, the market itself demands both an
increase in capital and more conservative lending.
We may not be able to change this phenomenon, 
but there are steps we can take to ensure that the
system is better prepared for it.•Financing arrangements allow the most leverage in
good times, but they force a dramatic reduction in
leverage in bad times.•As capital markets volatility increases, Basel II 
capital calculations and many risk management
tools, like Value-at-Risk, demand that more capital 
be held to own securities or loans.F. The impact of huge trade and financing imbalances
on interest rates, consumption and speculation
I suspect when analysts and economists study the fundamental causes of this crisis, they will point to the
enormous U.S. trade deficit as one of the main under-
lying culprits. Over an eight-year period, the United
States ran a trade deficit of $3 trillion. This means that
Americans bought $3 trillion more than they sold over-
seas. Dollars were used to pay for the goods. Foreign
countries took these dollars and purchased, for the
most part, U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securi-68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 18www.global-reports.com
19ties. It also is likely that this process kept U.S. interestrates very low, even beyond Federal Reserve policy, for
an extended period of time. It is likely that this excess
demand also kept risk premiums (i.e., credit spreads) 
at an all-time low for an extended period of time. Low
interest rates and risk premiums probably fueled exces-
sive leverage and speculation. Excess consumption
could be financed cheaply. And adding fuel to the fire,
in the summer of 2008, the United States had its third
energy crisis–further imbalancing capital flows. 
There have been times when large imbalances–such as
those in trade–sort themselves out without causing

massive global disruption. However, it is bad planning
and wishful thinking to assume that this will always be
the case. These imbalances shouldn’t be allowed to get
that large–they create too much potential risk. 
Many other factors may have added to this storm–an
expensive war in Iraq, short-selling, high energy prices,
and irrational pressure on corporations, money man-
agers and hedge funds to show increasingly better
returns. It also is clear that excessive, poorly designed
and short-term oriented compensation practices added
to the problem by rewarding a lot of bad behavior. The modern financial world has had its first majorfinancial crisis. So far, many major actors are gone:
many of the mortgage brokers, numerous hedge funds,
Wachovia, WaMu, Bear Stearns, Lehman and many
others. Some of the survivors are struggling, particular-
ly as we face a truly global, massive recession–and it

still is not over. IV. THE FUTURE OF OUR SYSTEM
The extent of the damage and the magnitude of the
systemic problems make it clear that our rules and reg-
ulations must be completely overhauled. Such changes
to the regulatory system couldhave huge implicationson the long-term health, and strategies, of our business.While unprecedented actions have been taken by boththe Federal Reserve and the Treasury, my hope is that
new policies are grounded in a thorough analysis of what
happened and what we need to do about it. Political
agendas or simplistic views will not serve us well.Often we hear the debate around the need for more or less regulation. What we need is better and more 

forward-looking regulation. Someone has famously said
that a crisis should not go to waste. But what is also true
is that it shouldn’t take a crisis to solve our problems.
During a crisis, people panic. This can make it harder,
not easier, to do the right thing. From our perspective,
certain improvements would make a big difference. We
would like to share with you some of our suggestions.A. The need for a systemic regulator with much
broader authority 
We agree with our leaders in government that weshould move ahead quickly to establish a systemic reg-
ulator. In the short term, this would allow us to focus
attention on correcting some underlying weaknesses 
in our system and filling the gaps in regulation that
contributed to the current situation. It also is clear that
U.S. policy must be coordinated with the proper set of
international regulators. When the crisis emerged, the
actions of individual countries had a critical impact on
numerous other countries. International coordination
is essential in resolving this kind of crisis.There should be procedures in place to deal with 
systemically important institutions Œ failure is fine 

as long as it™s orderly and controlled and 
doesn™t cause
systemic failure
Size is not the issue; rather, it is when institutions aretoo interconnected that an uncontrolled failure has the
potential to bring the whole system down. What we
need is a resolution process that allows failure withoutcausing damage to the whole system. In the case of Bear68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 1920Stearns or Lehman–both investment banks–regula-
tors did not have this protocol. They do have it, howev-
er, for commercial banks. Even more important, regula-
tors are going to need a resolution process for large,
global corporations that operate in many jurisdictions
around the world. The first goal should be to regulate financial institu-tions so they don’t fail. If they do fail, a proper resolu-
tion process would ensure that action is swift, appro-
priate and consistent. The lack of consistency alone
caused great confusion in the marketplace. For exam-
ple, when some of the recent failures took place, there
was inconsistent treatment among capital-holders (pre-
ferred stock and debt holders were treated very differ-
ently in different circumstances). It would have been
better if the regulators had a resolution process that
defined, a priori, what forms of aid companies would getand what the impact would be on capital-holders. The
FDIC resolution process for banks provides a very good
example of how a well-functioning process works.Various liquidity and “lender of last resort” facilities,like some of those put into place during this crisis, also
could be in place on an a prioribasis. These controlswould reduce risk and maximize confidence.Regulation needs to be administered by product and 
economic substance, not by legal entity
We have experienced the unintended consequences ofredundant regulation; i.e., different agencies regulating
the same product in the mortgage business, in the deriv-
atives business and in lending overall. If, on the other
hand, similar products were overseen by a single regula-
tor, that regulator would have much deeper knowledge
of the products and full information that extends across
institutions. The “regulatory competition” that could
have caused a race to the bottom would be eliminated.Hedge funds, private equity funds and off-balance sheet
vehicles must be included in our regulatory apparatus 

without compromising their freedoms and positive attributes
Certain vehicles like hedge funds and private equityfunds need to be regulated but only to protect the sys-
tem against risk. These vehicles do not need to be heav-ily regulated like a deposit-gathering bank. We shouldconsider requiring hedge funds over a certain size 
(say, $1 billion of equity) to register, provide quarterly 
audited reports, disclose total leverage and certain risk
attributes–like volatility and investment categories–

and outline operational procedures. They also could be
required to show their regulators (not their competi-
tors) any concentrated “trades” that could cause exces-
sive systemic risk. This all could be done without com-
promising flexibility or disclosing confidential posi-
tions while allowing these vehicles to move capital–

as freely and aggressively–as they see fit. 
The systemic regulator needs the ability to anticipate risk
and do something about it if necessary
There, undoubtedly, are financial products in the mar-ket today that–if unchecked–could have a destabiliz-

ing effect. A systemic regulator, had it been closely
watching the mortgage industry, might have identified
the unregulated mortgage business as a critical point 
of failure. This regulator also might have been able to
limit the leverage of Fannie and Freddie once they
were deemed to pose major systemic risks. Such a 
regulator might have been in the position to recognize
the one-sided credit derivative exposures of AIG and
the monoline insurers and do something about it.A systemic regulator also should be on the lookout for new or potential structural risks in our capital 
markets, such as the structural flaw that grew in
money market funds.B. The need to simplify our regulatory system
Everyone agrees that the existing system is fragmented
and overly complex. We have too many regulators and
too many regulatory gaps. No one agency has access to
all the relevant information. Responsibility often is
highly diffused. This problem could be relatively easy
to fix but only if we have the political will to fix it.C. The need to regulate the mortgage business Ñ
including commercial mortgages Ñ in its entirety
Many of the same gaps in regulation that helped leadus into this mess still exist today–for example, in the
68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/25/09  8:58 PM  Page 20www.global-reports.com
21mortgage business. Mortgages are the largest financialproduct in the United States, and while we do not want
to squelch innovation, the entire mortgage businessclearly needs to be regulated. This is not the first timethat mortgages and real estate have led this country
and many of its financial institutions into deep trouble.Proper regulation would go a long way toward stan-
dardizing products, testing new ones, improving cus-
tomer disclosure and clarifying responsibility. D. The need to fix securitization
We believe that securitization still is a highly effectiveway to finance assets. But some securitizations, particu-
larly mortgage securitizations, had an enormous flawbuilt into them: No one was responsible for the actualquality of the underwriting. Even mortgage servicing
contracts were not standardized such that if somethingwent wrong, the customer would get consistent resolu-
tion. We cannot rely on market discipline (i.e., elimi-
nating bad practices) alone to fix this problem. We have heard several reasonable suggestions on how the originator, packager and seller of securitizationscould be appropriately incentivized to ensure good
underwriting. For example, requiring the relevant parties
to keep part of the securitizations, much like we do with
syndicated loans today, would help manage resolution if
something were to go wrong and could go a long way to
re-establish market confidence and proper accountability.E. The need to fix Basel II Š leading to higher capital
ratios but a more stable system
As discussed earlier, Basel II has many flaws–it has
taken too long to implement, it responds slowly to
market changes and it is applied unevenly across global borders. Perhaps its worst failing is that, in itscurrent construct, Basel II does not include liquidity,
which allowed commercial and investment banks tobuy liquid or illiquid assets and fund them short.
While this practice did not appear quite so dangerous
in benign times, it created huge issues for many finan-
cial institutions during the market crisis. Basel II also
has relied too heavily on rating agencies and, by its
nature, has been highly pro-cyclical in its capitalrequirements for assets. It would be easy to make thesecapital requirements less pro-cyclical and require Basel
II to recognize the risk of short-term funding, particu-
larly that of wholesale funding. Finally, Basel II should
be applied consistently, reviewed continuously and
updated regularly. The world changes quickly.F. The need to get accounting under control
We at JPMorgan Chase are strong believers in good,conservative accounting. Accounting should always
reflect true underlying economics, which actually ishow we run the company. However, accounting prac-tices are not widely understood, are changed too fre-
quently and are too susceptible to interpretation andmanipulation. Sometimes, they even inadvertently
determine U.S. government policy. We generally like fair value accounting
For assets that are bought and sold, fair value account-ing creates the best discipline. Fair value accounting
(often referred to as mark-to-market accounting)already provides for some flexibility if recent prices areunder highly distressed conditions. In such cases, good
judgment and sound fundamental cash flow-type evalu-ations can be employed to value certain assets.
However, in our opinion, the application of fair value
accounting for certain categories needs to be reconsid-
ered. For example:•We now have to mark to market our private equity
investments by using potentially artificial bench-marks. These investments, by their nature, are very
illiquid and are intentionally held for several years.
To mark them to market, proxies made up of compa-
rable companies are used, and appropriate discounts
and judgments are applied. Essentially, we write
these investments up when markets are good and
write them down when markets are bad. But I am
fairly confident that this approach is not always
right. In many instances, cost is the best proxy for
fair value. We would rather describe our investments
to our shareholders, tell them when we think theseinvestments might be worth more and, certainly,
write them down on our financial statements when
they have become impaired.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 2122•A new mark-to-market rule addresses “debit valua-
tion adjustments.” Essentially, we now have to markto market credit spreads on certain JPMorgan Chasebonds that we issue. For example, when bond spreadswiden on JPMorgan Chase debt, we actually can
book a gain. Of course, when these spreads narrow,we book a loss. The theory is interesting, but, in
practice, it is absurd. Taken to the extreme, if a com-
pany is on its way to bankruptcy, it will be booking
huge profits on its own outstanding debt, right up
until it actually declares bankruptcy–at which point

it doesn’t matter.•It is becoming increasingly more difficult to compare
mark-to-market values of certain instruments across
different companies. While it’s too involved to go into
detail here, different companies may account for simi-
lar mark-to-market assets differently. This needs to be
addressed by ensuring that companies adhere to con-
sistent valuation principles while applying the rules.•Fair value accounting does not and should not apply
to all assets. Investments or certain illiquid assets that
are intended to be held for the longer term (like realestate or plant and equipment) or loans and certain
assets that are shorter term (like receivables or inven-
tory) all could actually be marked to market. There
are, in fact, markets for some of these assets, and oth-
ers could be calculated based on reasonable assump-
tions; for example, a farm would be worth more
when corn prices go up, and a semiconductor plant
would be worth less when semiconductor prices go
down. However, if we marked these assets in this
way, they would have wildly different prices depend-
ing on the health of the economy or the swings in
prices for their output. While accounting should 
recognize the real impairment in the value of assets,
marking the aforementioned assets to market every
day would be a waste of time. Under this scenario, it
would be quite hard for companies to invest in any-
thing illiquid or to make long-term investments.New accounting rules that have the potential to 
inadvertently affect how the capital markets function 

or change fundamental long-term U.S. government
policies should be made thoughtfully, deliberately 
and with broad input
For example, we all believe that companies shouldhave fully funded pension plans; i.e., the actual assets
in the plan should be enough to meet a fair estimate ofthe liabilities. Years ago, if this wasn’t the case, compa-nies were allowed to maintain a “deficit” and fund it
over several years. That deficit was not recorded on thefinancial statement of the company. A change in accounting rules dictated that the deficitshould not just be a footnote in the financial state-
ments but that it should be reflected directly in the
equity account of the corporation. Clearly, in very badmarkets, these deficits grow dramatically, thus deplet-ing the increasingly precious capital that companies
have. (This is just another example of a pro-cyclical
force). When companies realized they were getting
enormous volatility in their capital account, they began
to curtail or eliminate their pension plans in favor of
401(k) plans (where the individual bears all the invest-
ment risk). This was a rational, precautionary step. But
it, in effect, transferred the risk from the company to
the individual. No longer did the large corporations
assume the risk of providing a steady income stream to
retired employees. Instead, the risk was passed to theindividuals–many of whom could not afford it. 
This is a perfect example of how accounting inadver-tently sets policy. And, in my opinion, this was proba-
bly the wrong policy for the country. There would have
been many ways to be true to the economic purpose 
of accounting without making a detrimental policy
change. There are countless other examples, and we
hope regulators and accountants will eventually find
better ways to apply accounting principles.G. The need for appropriate counter-cyclical policies
During this crisis, it became evident that our systemcreated enormous pro-cyclical tendencies. In fact, I
can’t think of one counter-cyclical policy at all (otherthan emergency actions taken by the government).68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 22www.global-reports.com
23Accounting policies such as mark-to-market and loanloss reserving are pro-cyclical. Basel II capital require-
ments are pro-cyclical. Regulatory and legal require-ments are pro-cyclical. Repo and short-term financingare pro-cyclical. The one pro-cyclical tendency we 
probably can never correct is that of the market itself(i.e., the cost of capital goes way up in a downturn or
investors refuse to finance less liquid assets). I have
heard many good ideas about how to create some
counter-cyclical policies and will focus on three here.Loan loss reserving can easily be made counter-cyclical 
I find it absurd that loan loss reserves tend to be attheir lowest point precisely when things are about to
get worse. As things get worse and charge-offs rise dramatically, one must dramatically increase loan lossreserves, thus depleting capital rapidly. This problem
would be solved if banks were allowed to estimatecredit losses over the life of their loan portfolios.
Reserves should be maintained to absorb those losses.
This would enable banks to increase reserves when
losses are low and utilize reserves when losses are
high. Transparency would be fully preserved because
investors and regulators would still see actual charge-
offs and nonperformers. This would require a rational
explanation about the appropriateness of the lifetime
loss estimates. It also would have the positive effect of
constantly reminding CEOs, management teams and
investors that bad times, in fact, do happen–and that

they should be prepared for such events. Repo and short-term financing can easily be made 
counter-cyclical 
All banks now have access to the standard financingfacilities for securities and loans via the Federal
Reserve (i.e., the Fed will lend a specific amount ofmoney against specific assets). A suggestion is this: If an institution provides financing to clients in excess
of what the Fed would lend to the bank for the samesecurities, it would have to be disclosed to risk commit-
tees and the company’s Board of Directors. The Fed
then would have two major tools to reduce leverage
and in a way that is counter-cyclical–it could charge
higher capital costs to a bank when the bank is lendingmore than the Fed would lend or the Fed could reduce
the amount it would lend to the banks. Market players
would still be free to provide credit and leverage as
they see fit. Banks should have the ability to implement counter-
cyclical capital raising with rapid rights offerings
Banks and possibly other companies would be aided by having the ability to effect rights offerings at a
moment’s notice. Regulations should facilitate suchofferings–with the proper disclosure–in a matter of
days rather than weeks. This would allow a company
to raise capital and repair a balance sheet that mighthave been stretched by unanticipated market events
and to do so in a manner that is fair and does not
dilute the company’s existing shareholder base.H. The need for policies in health care, pensions,
energy and the environment, infrastructure and

education that will serve us well over time
Beyond the financial crisis, there are several importantissues that will dictate whether or not the United
States will continue to thrive over the next century. Webelieve our nation can and should be able to providehealth care coverage for all. It is the right thing to do, it
will help us build a stronger nation, and, if done prop-erly and efficiently, we believe it ultimately will be
cheaper than the current course we are on. On energy,
we now have experienced our third major crisis, and
we, as a nation, still have not executed a sensible long-
term energy policy. Again, we believe that done right,
an energy policy could be economically efficient, create
great innovation, reduce geopolitical tensions and
improve our environment. Similarly, we need to
improve our nation’s infrastructure and develop an
education system that befits our heritage. We can’t fall into the trap of institutional sclerosis–
now is the time to act. In the past, this nation has
shown the fortitude to work together to accomplish
great things, and we need to do that again. For our
part, we at JPMorgan Chase are doing everything we
can to be helpful to our leaders on all these issues.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 2324We believe these mortgage modifications are economi-cally and morally the right thing to do and that the pro-
gram underscores the importance of mutual respect–by
treating others in the way that we would like to be treat-ed in the same situation–while upholding the essential

principle that individuals, businesses and corporationsshould repay their loans if they can afford to do so. In
our view, its completeness eliminates the need for judi-
cial modification in bankruptcy proceedings. However,
if legislated, judicial modifications should be consistent
with this plan and focus only on borrowers who either
don’t qualify or have not been offered a modification.
Beyond that, it is time to quickly implement the mort-
gage modification program – even if it is not perfect in
everyone’s view – and to move on.B. Comments on the derivatives business
Derivatives have become an essential and widely usedrisk management tool. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association estimates that 90% of theFortune 500, 50% of mid-sized companies and thou-sands of other, smaller U.S. companies use derivatives
to manage certain risks, including currency and interestrate risk. As such, derivatives are a large business for
JPMorgan Chase and for firms around the world. It is
important to note that derivatives in and of themselves
did not cause this crisis. In fact, derivatives have per-
formed fairly well in this crisis environment. However,
it is clear that derivatives, at least in financial reporting,
are hard to understand, lack transparency and did con-
tribute somewhat to the crisis. At JPMorgan Chase, we
believe derivatives, when used properly, play an impor-
tant role in managing risk, and we are trying to address
the concerns about derivatives. •We have been standard setters in bringing more
transparency to our financial reporting and will continue to be. In this report, you will find extensive
details on our counterparty exposures and other risk
considerations that are central to understanding ourderivatives and other trading businesses. •Some of the concerns about derivatives have to do
with the large notional amounts. But those figures
are reference measurements and do not reflect actualV. WHAT COMES NEXT FOR 
JPMORGAN CHASE Your management team is deeply engaged and is act-ing with extreme caution in navigating these uncharted
waters. The U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve havecontinued to take bold and dramatic action, as havecentral banks and governments around the world. In
this next section, we will discuss some of the importantissues for JPMorgan Chase. A. Our leadership in mortgage modifications and
support for the administration™s mortgage programs
JPMorgan Chase is at the forefront of foreclosure pre-vention and mortgage modifications nationally. Our
foreclosure prevention efforts are intended to reachboth the $300 billion of loans that we own and the$1.2 trillion of investor-owned loans that we service.
We already have helped keep 330,000 borrowers intheir homes and expect to help avert 650,000 fore-
closures by the end of 2010. We are committed to
keeping borrowers in their homes by making sustain-
able, properly written loan modifications, in many
cases before a default occurs. We believe it is in the best interests of both the home-owner and the mortgage-holder to take corrective
action as soon as possible. Our re-default rates are half
the rates that the OCC has said are experienced by
national servicers. Re-default rates in the industry 
generally will come down once modifications are 
done with proper underwriting and as the economy
and home prices start to improve. If re-default rates
were extremely low, we probably should be doing
more modifications.We strongly support the Obama administration’smortgage modification program. The plan’s features
are aligned with the program we already had imple-
mented, extending them to more struggling homeown-
ers and providing us and other servicers with more
options to keep families in their homes. We also sup-
port the program because the guidelines establish a
clear, fair and consistent set of standards for all ser-
vicers to follow. It is intended for borrowers with
mortgages below $729,750; and all borrowers must
fully document their income, clearly demonstrate
financial hardship and live in the home. 68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 24www.global-reports.com
25counterparty credit risk. Actual risk is the mark-to-market value of the contract after taking into
account netting of risk across all transactions with a counterparty, collateral and hedging. Actual riskprojections also take into account the potential
future exposure coming from market moves.•Our counterparty exposures net of collateral and
hedges are $133 billion, and the company managesthose exposures name by name–like a hawk. The

figure is large, but we get paid to take the risks, we
reserve and account for them conservatively, and wemanage them in conjunction with all of our othercredit exposures.•As the overall amount of counterparty credit risk 
has grown, so has the concern that this growth has
increased systemic risk. To address this issue, we
support the development of clearinghouses, which
we believe will reduce the counterparty risk and
increase transparency for standardized contracts. We
already clear a significant portion of our interest rate
and commodities derivatives through clearinghouses,
and we have been active in the development of aclearinghouse for credit default swaps. Those deriva-
tives that are too customized to be cleared can easily
be monitored by regulators to ensure they do not
cause systemic risk. •AIG’s downfall wasn’t due to its use of derivatives
per se but to its poor risk management practices. 
The insurer took concentrated risks through credit
default swaps insuring mortgage-related assets. On
the other side of the equation, some dealers bought
this insurance from AIG without requiring them to
post collateral until such time as their credit rating
deteriorated. This is a case where bad risk manage-
ment on the part of AIG was compounded by bad
counterparty risk management by AIG’s counterpar-
ties. The potential systemic impact was substantial.
JPMorgan Chase did business with AIG, but, in line
with our general policies, we kept our credit expo-
sure relatively small so that our firm would not be
compromised if AIG had been allowed to fail. With
hindsight, the problem itself could have been bettercontained and dramatically mitigated had AIG beenproperly regulated and required to provide collateral
(to a clearinghouse or its counterparties). •There are regulatory gaps that need serious atten-
tion, as was evident with AIG. A way to prevent afuture AIG is by empowering a systemic risk regula-tor (as described earlier). Such a regulator would
have been in a position to see the risk piling up and
address it before the company failed. •Recognizing upfront profits for derivative transac-
tions can be problematic. Even though it is not stan-
dard accounting, we believe the profits relating to
the risk positions associated with derivatives should
be booked over the life of the transaction, propor-
tionate to the risk remaining. With proper management, systemic risks created by
derivatives can be dramatically reduced without com-
promising the ability of companies to use them in
managing their exposures.C. The reasons for maintaining a fortress balance
sheet and cutting the dividend 
Maintaining a fortress balance sheet will always beessential to us. Our Tier 1 ratio is 10.9%, with tangible
common equity of $81 billion, and we will continue toincrease our loan loss reserves, as appropriate. With$24 billion in allowance for credit losses at the end of
2008, we believe our loan loss reserves across all ourbusinesses are among the strongest in the industry.Out of an abundance of caution to be prepared for thefuture during this uncertain environment, we believed
it was prudent to reduce our quarterly dividend from
$0.38 to $0.05 per share, effective with our next sched-uled dividend payment. We did not take this action lightly, and we recognizeour tremendous obligation to shareholders to seek to
maintain dividend levels. But extraordinary times
require extraordinary measures. So while our perform-
ance and capital are solid, we have an even higher 
obligation to ensure that our fortress balance sheet
remains intact. This will enable us to stay flexible to68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 2526seize opportunities and continue to build and invest inour market-leading businesses, even in a highly
stressed environment. We maintain a long-term commitment to the dividendand still view a 30%-40% payout ratio of normalized
earnings as ultimately reasonable. We will continue to review all relevant criteria to ensure the ongoing
strength of our capital base and will await a more stable
economic environment before increasing the dividend.D. Comments on TARP 
While the decision to reduce our dividend was notdirectly related to accepting TARP, it does provide us
with additional capital–about $5 billion per year–
which could position us to repay TARP funds soonerthan otherwise would have been possible. We, of course,
would do this in consultation with our regulators.Many people would like us to repay the TARP fundsas soon as we can; some are angry over the changing
government conditions relating to the acceptance of
TARP funds; and some would like to see swift repay-
ment as a matter of principle. The reason we accepted TARP still stands–we believed
it was in the best interests of the United States and the
banking system overall. We will not react capriciously
or out of anger in determining when to repay the
TARP funds. We will repay them only if doing so is
consistent with the best interests of our country and
our company.E. The impact of a deep recession, and the 
government™s stress test
We have been forthright and consistent in letting ourshareholders know that a recession will impact our
financial results, a severe recession even more so. Andthat’s if we do everything right. Last year, we notedthat the recession would have a significant impact 
on credit and that in a difficult environment, “credit losses could rise significantly, by as much as $5 billion
over time, which would require increases in loan loss
reserves.” Managed net charge-offs were $13 billion in
2008, up from $7 billion in 2007. Our current view is
that 2009 charge-offs will be even higher.The recession will ripple through and affect all of ourconsumer and commercial credit exposures–some

worse than others. In addition to higher charge-offs, it
will require substantial additions to reserves, which we
have increased from $10 billion at the end of 2007 to
$24 billion at the end of 2008. We already said last
year how bad we thought mortgage and home equity
losses might get, and, unfortunately, they have become
even worse. The severity of this recession also could
have a dramatic impact on credit card losses; we now
expect a 9% unemployment rate to lead to charge-offsof higher than 9%. (In the past, we would expect
unemployment of 9% to lead to charge-offs of 7% or
more. Now, however, we believe that the combined
effect of unemployment with the major housing down-
turn will lead to a higher charge-off rate.) The Treasury, in conjunction with the OCC, FDIC andFederal Reserve, has launched a stress test program to
ensure that the 19 largest banks (those with more than51015%200420052006

27$100 billion in assets) have the capacity to remainproperly capitalized in a highly stressed environment.
The government’s adverse economic environment envisions a two-year recession, where unemploymentreaches 10.4% and the housing price index declines
48% from peak to trough. While some banks may needadditional capital or support, a successful completion
of the stress test program should eliminate the need to
guess which banks are properly capitalized and which
are not. In the best case, it will affirm the banks’ capi-
tal, accounting and reserve ratios, which will remove
uncertainty in the marketplace and increase financial
stability. (Unfortunately, the announcement of the
stress test, which is expected to be presented in late
April, is causing enormous consternation in the mar-
kets that would have been better to avoid.) We regularly do stress tests for our company, alwaysprojecting forward our capital and liquidity. We think
our capital ratios will maintain their extremely strong
levels throughout the government’s “adverse economic
environment.” You also should know that your company will be prepared for an environment even worse than the one
just described. F. Recent government actions and the potential
power of concerted efforts
Governments around the world have taken dramaticactions during this crisis. The Federal Reserve and
Treasury of the United States have provided $5 tril-lion of liquidity facilities to finance various types ofassets and–to stabilize individual companies and the

overall system–have guaranteed almost $1 trillion of
assets on the balance sheets of certain institutions
and injected $1 trillion of capital into the financial
system. In addition, the government is trying to
reduce the mortgage rate by buying mortgages, 
making it easier to refinance; reducing consumer 
payments; and aggressively pushing mortgage 
modification programs. We believe the recent Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF 
program, which allows private investors to get non-recourse financing on asset-backed securities, will aid the securitization markets. This program eventual-
ly may lend up to $1 trillion to finance new securi-
tized loans. It can also be modified and extended 
as appropriate. It should be noted that many of the
government’s programs are not only replacing bank
lending but are also filling the gaps left by many ofthe nonbank lenders in the capital markets.We know that these government actions will haveunintended consequences and can lead to political
interference and that we will need to remove these
forms of support over time, intelligently. All these
concerns add to our worries, particularly about poten-
tial future inflation, but we’ll reserve such a discus-
sion for another time.There is no silver bullet: We believe that all of theseactions, if implemented properly and executed–in a

timely way and in conjunction with the U.S. fiscal
stimulus program–could have an enormous positive

impact. The sum of the parts can be a lot more power-
ful than each individual action.We see that the largest global economic downturn isbeing met with massive global government actions –
and while the specific outcome is uncertain, there is
good reason to think that the governments will even-
tually win. This country has had its defining moments: the CivilWar; the Great Depression; World War II. This may
also be one of them. President Abraham Lincoln said,“A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Just asour military acts in concert – across the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marines, under one commander-in-chief
– now, so too, should we. This means coordination
across the House and Senate, Democrats and Republi-cans. If we rise to the challenge now, we will prevail.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 2728•We have always paid a significant percentage of 
our incentive compensation in stock, approximately 50% for our senior management team. That stockvests over multiple years.•Our senior management team generally must retain
and hold approximately 75% of all stock everreceived from the company.There are a lot of legitimate complaints about compen-sation – not just at financial firms but at all types of
companies. Good companies know that compensation
can cause bad incentives. They know there is no magic
to a calendar year and that they must be careful not to
pay people too much in a current year – due to either
exuberance or real market pressures. Compensation is
one of the most complex issues we deal with because 
it is important to the individuals and the company.
Improperly done, it can destroy a company. We strive
mightily to hire, train and retain the best talent –
smart, ethical, hard-working, entrepreneurial individu-
als – and getting compensation right is a critical part 
of this process.Vl. GETTING COMPENSATION RIGHT 
IS CRITICALLooking back at last year, I continue to reflect on howproud I am of the people in this company. It often is 
in the toughest of times that one learns what peopleare really made of. Our employees worked harder thanever and performed admirably for the company, for
our clients and even for our country under enormouslychallenging conditions. Throughout the unexpected
events and incredible pressure of 2008, it was hard 
not to be impressed by the intellect, work ethic and
strength of character of the individuals at this firm. I know many Americans are concerned about compen-sation practices across the financial services industry,and many of the concerns are quite legitimate. At
JPMorgan Chase, we believe we have been at the fore-
front of sensible compensation practices. Our process
is disciplined and rigorous, and we have always sought
to reward the long-term performance of our employees.
Our practices reflect this: •We pay our people for performing well over multi-
ple years and for helping to build a company withlong-term, sustainable performance.•In looking at performance, we always try to properly
account for risk being taken. We are also mindfulthat a rising tide lifts all boats, and we do not want
to pay people on that basis.•Performance to us has never been simply a financial
measure. It has always included the broader contri-
bution a person brings to a company, such as main-
taining integrity and compliance; recruiting and
training a diverse, outstanding workforce; and build-
ing better systems and innovation.•We have had in place a bonus recoupment policy
beyond that required by Sarbanes-Oxley.•We don’t have: change-of-control agreements, special
executive retirement plans, golden parachutes, 
special severance packages for senior executives 
or merger bonuses.68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 28www.global-reports.com
Throughout our history, we have always believed thatour obligation extends beyond simply serving share-
holders, clients and employees. For us, public servicemeans working with government officials, in a nonpar-tisan way, to fully identify, analyze and overcome our
problems. We believe the right solutions come onlywhen we participate in a constructive dialogue, get
beyond the words, “It’s not politically feasible,” and
take bold steps. Ensuring the health and vibrancy of this company for the
next 200 years is paramount
The real measure of strength for a country–or a 
company–is not whether we have problems but how

we learn from them, overcome them and emerge betterfor it. For more than 200 years, the world has turned to JPMorgan Chase in times of difficulty and turmoil,
counting on our people to support our country, ourclients and our communities around the world. We 
feel that obligation more intensely than ever and are
focused on doing everything in our power to make
sure this company remains strong, healthy and vibrant
so that it can continue to do what it does best for the
next 200 years. Jamie DimonChairman and Chief Executive OfficerMarch 23, 200929VII. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We believe we have a deep responsibility to you, ourshareholders, and to our creditors, our clients and all
our employees. We work incredibly hard to uphold allour obligations every day. Our commitment to corporate citizenship
We have always been deeply committed to being goodcorporate citizens. It is an essential part of what we
do–and who we are–as a firm. As such, we have
intensified our corporate responsibility efforts, direct-ing resources to make a meaningful difference to the
people who live and work in the communities inwhich we operate. While some may think of us as a Wall Street firm, wealso are very much a part of Main Street: We employ
225,000 people worldwide in 48 U.S. states and more
than 60 countries. Our 5,000 branches serve customersin 23 states. We provide health care coverage for400,000 people. On average, we pay more than $10 
billion a year in taxes to the U.S. government, as well
as to state and local jurisdictions.Last year alone, our firm and our Foundation madecharitable contributions of approximately $100 million
in our markets across the United States. And over the
past five years, we have given more than $600 million
to 13,500 organizations globally. These tremendously
important investments help inner-city young adults 
get jobs, fund educational programs, build affordablehousing and support rebuilding efforts after a tsunami,
earthquake or hurricane hits one of our global commu-
nities. Our people are devoted to the communities they
serve–and, in a mutually beneficial relationship, we

thrive when those communities are healthy, secure 
and prosperous.The Way Forward: Stepping up our game
We strive to help our clients and our customers inevery way–and especially during these difficult times.

This overall effort, part of an initiative called The WayForward, represents our commitment to the actions wehave taken and are willing to take to move America
and the global economy forward. 68359jp_txt_1_29:68359jp_txt_1_29  3/26/09  7:34 PM  Page 29

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
41EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
This overview of management™s discussion and analysis highlightsselected information and may not contain all of the information thatis important to readers of this Annual Report. For a completedescription of events, trends and uncertainties, as well as the capital,liquidity, credit and market risks, and the critical accounting esti-mates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, thisAnnual Report should be read in its entirety.Business overviewJPMorgan Chase reported 2008 net income of $5.6 billion,or $1.37

per share,and total net revenue of $67.3 billion,compared with

record net income of $15.4 billion,or $4.38 per share,and record

total net revenue of $71.4 billion,for 2007.Return on common equi-

ty was 4% in 2008,compared with 13% in 2007.Results in 2008

include the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.(ﬁBear

Stearnsﬂ) on May 30,2008,and the acquisition of the banking oper-

ations of Washington Mutual Bank (ﬁWashington Mutualﬂ) on

September 25,2008.
The decline in net income for the year was the result of a significant-
ly higher provision for credit losses,reflecting the addition of $13.7

billion to the Firm™s allowance for credit losses in 2008;a decline in

total net revenue driven by over $10 billion of markdowns on mort-
gage-related positions and leveraged lending exposures in the

Investment Bank;and an increase in total noninterest expense due
to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and the Bear
Stearns merger.
The business environment for financial services firms was extremely
challenging in 2008.The global economy slowed,with many coun-

tries,including the U.S.,slipping into recession.Financial conditions

worsened throughout the year amid a number of unprecedented
developments that undermined the economic outlook and eroded
confidence in global financial markets.JPMorgan Chase acquired

Bear Stearns through a merger consummated in May and acquired
the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the Federal

Deposit Insurance Corporation (ﬁFDICﬂ) in September.The U.S.feder-

al government placed the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation

(ﬁFreddie Macﬂ) and the Federal National Mortgage Association

(ﬁFannie Maeﬂ) under its control.Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

declared bankruptcy.The Bank of America Corporation acquired

Merrill Lynch & Co.,Inc.and Wells Fargo & Company acquired

Wachovia Corporation.The government provided a loan to American

International Group,Inc.(ﬁAIGﬂ) in exchange for an equity interest in

AIG to prevent the insurer™s failure.Morgan Stanley,The Goldman

Sachs Group,Inc.,GMAC,American Express,Discover Financial

Services and CIT Group received approval from the Board of

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ﬁFederal Reserveﬂ) to

become federal bank holding companies.In other industries,the U.S.

government provided temporary loans to General Motors

Corporation and Chrysler LLC.
These events accompanied severe strains in term funding markets,
reflecting heightened concerns about counterparty risk.As a result,

LIBOR rates rose significantly in the fall,despite a round of coordinat-

ed rate cuts by a number of central banks.By year-end,LIBOR rates

eased in response to proposals to insure deposits and selected debt
of financial institutions.The turmoil in financial markets during 2008

led to tighter credit conditions and diminished liquidity,causing con-

sumers and businesses around the world to become more cautious
and curtail spending and investment activity.As a result,the U.S.

economy contracted sharply,2.8 million jobs were lost in 2008,and

the U.S.unemployment rate rose significantly,to 7.2% by year-end.
The continued economic and financial disruption led the Federal
Reserve to reduce its target overnight interest rates to near zero in

the fourth quarter of 2008,capping off a year of near-continuous rate

reductions.In addition,the U.S.Department of the Treasury (the ﬁU.S.

Treasuryﬂ),the Federal Reserve and the FDIC,working in cooperation

with foreign governments and other central banks,including the Bank

of England,the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank,

began,in the fourth quarter of 2008,to take a variety of extraordi-

nary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets

and strengthen financial institutions,including capital injections,guar-

antees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from
banks.In particular,on October 3,2008,the Emergency Economic

Stabilization Act of 2008 (the ﬁEESAﬂ) was signed into law.Pursuant

to the EESA,the U.S.Treasury has the authority to take a range of

(b)JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (ﬁFDICﬂ) for $1.9 billion.The fair value of the net

assets acquired from the FDIC exceeded the purchase price which resulted in negative
goodwill.In accordance with SFAS 141,nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale

were written down against that negative goodwill.The negative goodwill that remained

after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain in 2008.

The allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired (based on their respective

fair values at September 25,2008) and the resulting negative goodwill may be modified

through September 25,2009,as more information is obtained about the fair value of

assets acquired and liabilities assumed.(c)On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of
Washington Mutual Bank.On May 30,2008,the merger with The Bear Stearns

Companies,Inc.was consummated.Each of these transactions was accounted for as a

purchase and their respective results of operations are included in the Firm™s results from

each respective transaction date.For additional information on these transactions,see

Note 2 on pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report.
Management’s discussion and analysis
42JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
actions to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S.financial markets,
including the purchase by the U.S.Treasury of certain troubled assets

from financial institutions (the ﬁTroubled Asset Relief Programﬂ) and

the direct purchase by the U.S.Treasury of equity of financial institu-

tions (the ﬁCapital Purchase Programﬂ).
The efforts to restore confidence in the financial markets and promote
economic growth continue in 2009,with initiatives including a fiscal

stimulus bill,the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009,

which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on February

17,2009.Also in February,the U.S.Treasury outlined a plan to restore

stability to the financial system and President Obama proposed a plan
to help distressed homeowners.The Federal Reserve,working with

other government and regulatory agencies,has also implemented a

number of new programs to promote the proper functioning of the

credit markets and reintroduce liquidity to the financial system.Such

actions taken by U.S.regulatory agencies include the introduction of

programs to restore liquidity to money market mutual funds,the com-

mercial paper market,and other fixed-income securities markets.In

addition,the FDIC issued a temporary liquidity guarantee program

(the ﬁTLG Programﬂ) for the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institu-

tions,as well as deposits in noninterest-bearing transaction deposit

accounts.
Despite the difficult operating environment and overall drop in earn-
ings,JPMorgan Chase maintained a strong balance sheet and pro-

duced underlying growth in many business areas.The Tier 1 capital

ratio was 10.9% at year-end;Treasury & Securities Services and

Commercial Banking each reported record revenue and net income
for the second straight year;the consumer businesses opened millions

of new checking and credit card accounts;Asset Management experi-

enced record net inflows in assets under management;and the

Investment Bank gained market share in all major fee categories.The

diversified nature of the Firm™s businesses and its strong capital posi-

tion enabled it to weather the recessionary environment during 2008.JPMorgan Chase has taken a leadership role in helping to stabilize
the financial markets.It assumed the risk and expended the necessary

resources to acquire Bear Stearns and the banking operations of

Washington Mutual.In October 2008,the Firm agreed to accept a

$25 billion capital investment by the U.S.Treasury under the Capital

Purchase Program.JPMorgan Chase has continued to lend to clients

in a safe and sound manner and to provide liquidity to multiple finan-
cial markets.The Firm has implemented programs that have prevented

more than 300,000 foreclosures,with plans to help more than

400,000 more families keep their homes through Chase-owned mort-

gage modifications over the next two years.The Firm has expanded

this effort to include over $1.1 trillion of investor-owned mortgages.
The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each busi-ness segment compared with the prior year, and discusses results on amanaged basis unless otherwise noted. For more information aboutmanaged basis, see Explanation and reconciliation of the Firm™s use ofnon-GAAP financial measures on pages 50Œ51 of this Annual Report.Investment Bank reported a net loss for the year,compared with
net income in 2007.The significant decline in results reflected lower

total net revenue,a higher provision for credit losses and higher total

noninterest expense.Markdowns of over $10 billion on mortgage-

related positions and leveraged lending funded and unfunded com-

mitments drove fixed income trading revenue lower;investment

banking fees and equity trading revenue declined as well.These

decreases were offset by record performance in rates and currencies,

credit trading,commodities and emerging markets,as well as strong

equity client revenue,and gains from the widening of the Firm™s

credit spread on certain structured liabilities and derivatives.The pro-

vision for credit losses rose from the 2007 level,predominantly

reflecting a higher allowance for credit losses,driven by a weakening

credit environment,as well as the effect of the transfer of $4.9 bil-

lion of funded and unfunded leveraged lending commitments to

retained loans from held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2008.The

increase in total noninterest expense was largely driven by additional

expense relating to the Bear Stearns merger,offset partially by lower

performance-based compensation expense.In addition,IB benefited

from a reduction in deferred tax liabilities on overseas earnings.
Retail Financial Servicesnet income declined,reflecting a signifi-
cant increase in the provision for credit losses,predominantly offset by

positive mortgage servicing rights (ﬁMSRﬂ) risk management results
and the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Additional drivers of revenue growth included wider loan and deposit
spreads and higher loan and deposit balances.The provision for credit

losses increased as housing price declines have continued to result in
significant increases in estimated losses,particularly for high loan-to-

value home equity and mortgage loans.The provision was also affect-

ed by an increase in estimated losses for the auto,student and busi-

ness banking loan portfolios.Total noninterest expense rose from the

2007 level,reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transac-

tion,higher mortgage reinsurance losses,increased mortgage servic-

ing expense and investments in the retail distribution network.Card Services
net income declined,driven by a higher provision for
credit losses partially offset by higher managed total net revenue.The

growth in managed total net revenue was driven by the impact of

the Washington Mutual transaction,higher average managed loan

balances,wider loan spreads and increased interchange income,off-

set predominantly by increased rewards expense and higher volume-

driven payments to partners,as well as the effect of higher revenue

reversals associated with higher charge-offs.The managed provision

for credit losses increased from the prior year due to an increase in
the allowance for loan losses and a higher level of charge-offs.Total

noninterest expense rose from last year,largely due to the impact of

the Washington Mutual transaction.
Commercial Banking
net income increased,surpassing the record
level posted in 2007.The results were driven by record total net rev-

43income.These were partially offset by spread compression in the lia-
bility and loan portfolios.The increase in the provision for credit loss-

es reflected a weakening credit environment and growth in loan bal-

ances.Total noninterest expense decreased from the prior year,due

to lower performance-based incentive compensation and volume-
based charges from service providers,predominantly offset by the

impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.
Treasury & Securities Services 
net income increased over therecord level set in 2007,driven by record total net revenue,partially

offset by higher noninterest expense.Worldwide Securities Services

posted record net revenue,driven by wider spreads in securities lend-

ing,foreign exchange and liability products,increased product usage

by new and existing clients,and higher liability balances.These bene-

fits were partially offset by market depreciation.Treasury Services

posted record net revenue,reflecting higher liability balances and

volume growth in electronic funds transfer products and trade loans.

Total noninterest expense increased,reflecting higher expense relat-

ed to business and volume growth,as well as continued investment

in new product platforms.
Asset Managementnet income decreased,driven by lower total net
revenue,offset partially by lower total noninterest expense.The decline

in revenue was due to lower performance fees and the effect of lower

markets,including the impact of lower market valuations of seed capi-

tal investments.Partially offsetting these revenue declines were higher

deposit and loan balances,the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger,

increased revenue from net asset inflows and wider deposit spreads.

The provision for credit losses rose from the prior year,reflecting an

increase in loan balances,higher net charge-offs and a weakening

credit environment.Total noninterest expense declined compared with

2007,driven by lower performance-based compensation,largely offset

by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and higher compensation
expense resulting from increased average headcount.
Corporate/Private Equity
net income declined from the 2007level and included an extraordinary gain related to the Washington

Mutual transaction and a conforming loan loss provision.Excluding

these items,the decrease in net income from the prior year was driv-

en by private equity losses in 2008,compared with gains in 2007,

losses on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,and a

charge related to the offer to repurchase auction-rate securities.

These declines were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of

Visa shares in its initial public offering and a gain on the dissolution

of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture and the gain from

the sale of MasterCard shares.The decrease in total noninterest

expense reflected a reduction of credit card-related litigation
expense,partially offset by higher merger costs.
The Firm™s managed provision for credit losses was $24.6 billion for
2008,compared with $9.2 billion for 2007.The total consumer-man-

aged provision for credit losses was $21.3 billion,compared with

$8.3 billion in the prior year,reflecting increases in the allowance for

credit losses related to home equity,mortgage and credit card loans,

as well as higher net charge-offs.Consumer-managed net charge-

offs were $13.0 billion,compared with $6.8 billion in the prior year,

resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 3.06% and 1.97%,

respectively.The wholesale provision for credit losses was $3.3 bil-
lion,compared with $934 million in the prior year,due to an
increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a

weakening credit environment and loan growth.Wholesale net

charge-offs were $402 million,compared with net charge-offs of

$72 million in the prior year,resulting in net charge-off rates of

0.18% and 0.04%,respectively.The Firm had total nonperforming

assets of $12.7 billion at December 31,2008,up from the prior-year

level of $3.9 billion.Total stockholders™ equity at December 31,2008,was $166.9 bil-
lion,and the Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.9%.During 2008,the Firm

raised $11.5 billion of common equity and $32.8 billion of preferred

equity,including a warrant issued to the U.S.Treasury.
2009 Business outlookThe following forward-looking statements are based upon the cur-rent beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase™s management andare subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks anduncertainties could cause JPMorgan Chase™s actual results to differmaterially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. 
JPMorgan Chase™s outlook for 2009 should be viewed against the
backdrop of the global and U.S.economies,financial markets activity,

the geopolitical environment,the competitive environment and client

activity levels.Each of these linked factors will affect the performance

of the Firm and its lines of business.In addition,as a result of recent

market conditions and events,Congress and regulators have increased

their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.The Firm™s current

expectations are for the global and U.S.economic environments to

weaken further and potentially faster,capital markets to remain under

stress,for there to be continued decline in U.S.housing prices,and for

Congress and regulators to continue to adopt legislation and regula-
tions that could limit or restrict the Firm™s operations,or impose addi-

tional costs upon the Firm in order to comply with such new laws or
rules.These factors are likely to continue to adversely impact the Firm™s

revenue,credit costs,overall business volumes and earnings.
Given the potential stress on the consumer from rising unemploy-
ment,the continued downward pressure on housing prices and the

elevated national inventory of unsold homes,management remains

extremely cautious with respect to the credit outlook for home equity,

mortgage and credit card portfolios.Management expects continued

deterioration in credit trends for the home equity,mortgage and credit

card portfolios,which will likely require additions to the consumer

loan loss allowance in 2009 or beyond.Economic data released in

early 2009 indicated that housing prices and the labor market have

weakened further since year-end,and that deterioration could continue

into late 2009.Based on management™s current economic outlook,

quarterly net charge-offs could,over the next several quarters,

reach $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion for the home equity portfolio,

$375 million to $475 million for the prime mortgage portfolio,and

$375 million to $475 million for the subprime mortgage portfolio.

Management expects the managed net charge-off rate for Card

Services (excluding the impact resulting from the acquisition of

Washington Mutual™s banking operations) to approach 7% in the first

quarter of 2009 and likely higher by the end of the year depending

on unemployment levels.These charge-off rates could increase even

further if the economic environment continues to deteriorate 
Management’s discussion and analysis
44JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
further than management™s current expectations
.The wholesale provi-
sion for credit losses and nonperforming assets are likely to increase

over time as a result of the deterioration in underlying credit condi-

tions.Wholesale net charge-offs in 2008 increased from historic lows

in 2007 and are likely to increase materially in 2009 as a result of

increasing weakness in the credit environment.The Investment Bank continues to be negatively affected by the dis-
ruption in the credit and mortgage markets,as well as by overall

lower levels of liquidity.The continuation of these factors could

potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity,lower investment

banking fees and lower trading revenue.In addition,if the Firm™s

own credit spreads tighten,as they did in the fourth quarter of 2008,

the change in the fair value of certain trading liabilities would also

negatively affect trading results.The Firm held $12.6 billion (gross

notional) of legacy leveraged loans and unfunded commitments as

held-for-sale as of December 31,2008.Markdowns averaging 45%

of the gross notional value have been taken on these legacy posi-

tions as of December 31,2008,resulting in a net carrying value of

$6.9 billion.Leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult

to hedge effectively,and if market conditions further deteriorate,

additional markdowns may be necessary on this asset class.The

Investment Bank also held,at December 31,2008,an aggregate $6.1

billion of prime and Alt-A mortgage exposure,which is also difficult to

hedge effectively,and $875 million of subprime mortgage exposure.

In addition,the Investment Bank had $7.7 billion of commercial mort-

gage exposure.In spite of active hedging,mortgage exposures could

be adversely affected by worsening market conditions and further

deterioration in the housing market.The combination of credit costs

and additional markdowns on the various exposures noted above

could reach or exceed $2.0 billion for the first quarter of 2009.Earnings in Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services
could decline due to the impact of tighter spreads in the low interest
rate environment or a decline in the level of liability balances.Earnings

in Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management will likely

deteriorate if market levels continue to decline,due to reduced levels

of assets under management,supervision and custody.Earnings in the

Corporate/Private Equity segment could be more volatile due to

increases in the size of the Firm™s investment portfolio,which is largely

comprised of investment-grade securities.Private Equity results are

dependent upon the capital markets and at current market levels,man-

agement believes additional write-downs of $400 million or more are
likely in the first quarter of 2009.
Assuming economic conditions do not worsen beyond management™s
current expectations,management continues to believe that the net

income impact of the acquisition of Washington Mutual™s banking

operations could be approximately $0.50 per share in 2009;the Bear

Stearns merger could contribute $1 billion (after-tax) annualized after

2009;and merger-related items,which include both the Washington

Mutual transaction and the Bear Stearns merger,could be approxi-

mately $600 million (after-tax) in 2009.
Recent developmentsOn February 23,2009,the Board of Directors reduced the Firm's quar-

terly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share,effective

for the dividend payable April 30,2009,to shareholders of record on

April 6,2009.The action taken will enable the Firm to retain an addi-

tional $5.0 billion in common equity per year.The Firm expects to

maintain the dividend at this level for the time being.The action was

taken in order to help ensure that the Firm™s balance sheet retained

the capital strength necessary to weather a further decline in economic
conditions.The Firm intends to return to a more normalized dividend

payout ratio as soon as feasible after the environment has stabilized.

(a)On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington
Mutual Bank.On May 30,2008,the Bear Stearns merger was consummated.Each of these

transactions was accounted for as a purchase and their respective results of operations are

included in the Firm™s results from each respective transaction date.For additional information

on these transactions,see Note 2 on pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report.
2008 compared with 2007 
Total net revenue of $67.3 billion was down $4.1 billion,or 6%,from

the prior year.The decline resulted from the extremely challenging

business environment for financial services firms in 2008.Principal

transactions revenue decreased significantly and included net mark-

downs on mortgage-related positions and leveraged lending funded

and unfunded commitments,losses on preferred securities of Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac,and losses on private equity investments.Also

contributing to the decline in total net revenue were other losses and
markdowns recorded in other income,including the Firm™s share of

Bear Stearns™ losses from April 8 to May 30,2008.These declines

were largely offset by higher net interest income,proceeds from the

sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering,and the gain on the

dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture.
Investment banking fees were down from the record level of the
prior year due to lower debt underwriting fees,as well as lower advi-

sory and equity underwriting fees,both of which were at record lev-

els in 2007.These declines were attributable to reduced market

activity.For a further discussion of investment banking fees,which

are primarily recorded in IB,see IB segment results on pages 54Œ56

of this Annual Report.
In 2008,principal transactions revenue,which consists of revenue
from the Firm™s trading and private equity investing activities,

declined by $19.7 billion from the prior year.Trading revenue

decreased $14.5 billion to a negative $9.8 billion compared with a
positive $4.7 billion in 2007.The decline in trading revenue was

largely driven by higher net markdowns of $5.9 billion on mortgage-related exposures compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year;high-
er net markdowns of $4.7 billion on leveraged lending funded and

unfunded commitments compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year;
losses of $1.1 billion on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac;and weaker equity trading results compared with a

record level in 2007.In addition,trading revenue was adversely

impacted by the Bear Stearns merger.Partially offsetting the decline

in trading revenue were record results in rates and currencies,credit

trading,commodities and emerging markets,as well as strong equity

client revenue across products and total gains of $2.0 billion from
the widening of the Firm™s credit spread on certain structured liabili-

ties and derivatives,compared with $1.3 billion in 2007.Private

equity results also declined substantially from the prior year,swing-

ing to losses of $908 million in 2008 from gains of $4.3 billion in
2007.In addition,the first quarter of 2007 included a fair value

adjustment related to the adoption of SFAS 157.For a further discus-

sion of principal transactions revenue,see IB and Corporate/Private

Equity segment results on pages 54Œ56 and 73Œ75,respectively,and

Note 6 on pages 158Œ160 of this Annual Report.
Lending & deposit-related fees rose from the prior year,predomi-
nantly resulting from higher deposit-related fees and the impact of

the Washington Mutual transaction.For a further discussion of lend-

ing & deposit-related fees,which are mostly recorded in RFS,TSS and

CB,see the RFS segment results on pages 57Œ62,the TSS segment

results on pages 68Œ69,and the CB segment results on pages

66Œ67 of this Annual Report.
The decline in asset management,administration and commissions
revenue compared with 2007 was driven by lower asset manage-

ment fees in AM due to lower performance fees and the effect of

lower markets on assets under management.This decline was par-

tially offset by an increase in commissions revenue related predomi-
nantly to higher brokerage transaction volume within IB™s equity mar-

kets revenue,which included additions from Bear Stearns™ Prime

Services business;and higher administration fees in TSS driven by

wider spreads in securities lending and increased product usage by
new and existing clients.For additional information on these fees

and commissions,see the segment discussions for IB on pages

54Œ56,RFS on pages 57Œ62,TSS on pages 68Œ69,and AM on

pages 70Œ72 of this Annual Report.
The increase in securities gains compared with the prior year was
due to the repositioning of the Corporate investment securities port-

folio as a result of lower interest rates as part of managing the struc-

tural interest rate risk of the Firm,and higher gains from the sale of

MasterCard shares.For a further discussion of securities gains,which

are mostly recorded in the Firm™s Corporate business,see the

Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 73Œ75 of this

Annual Report.Mortgage fees and related income increased from the prior year,
driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue,which benefited

from an improvement in MSR risk management results and increased

loan servicing revenue.Mortgage production revenue increased

slightly,as the impact of growth in originations was predominantly
Principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private
equity gains.Trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006

level,primarily due to net markdowns in IB of $1.4 billion on sub-

prime positions,including subprime collateralized debt obligations

(ﬁCDOsﬂ),and $1.3 billion on leveraged lending funded loans and

unfunded commitments.Also in IB,markdowns of securitized prod-

ucts related to nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading per-

formance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong
revenue in both rates and equities.Equities benefited from strong

client activity and record trading results across all products.IB™s

Credit Portfolio results increased compared with the prior year,pri-

marily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities.The

increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly

higher level of gains,the classification of certain private equity car-

ried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in

the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments

resulting from the adoption of SFAS 157 (ﬁFair Value

Measurementsﬂ).For a further discussion of principal transactions

revenue,see IB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on

pages 54Œ56 and 73Œ75,respectively,and Note 6 on pages

158Œ160 of this Annual Report.
Lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level,driven pri-
marily by higher deposit-related fees and the Bank of New York trans-

action.For a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees,

which are mostly recorded in RFS,TSS and CB,see the RFS segment

results on pages 57Œ62,the TSS segment results on pages 68Œ69,

and the CB segment results on pages 66Œ67 of this Annual Report.
Asset management,administration and commissions revenue
reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006.
Increased assets under management and higher performance and
placement fees in AM drove the record results.The 18% growth in

assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset

inflows and market appreciation across all segments:Institutional,

Retail,Private Bank and Private Wealth Management.TSS also con-

tributed to the rise in asset management,administration and com-

missions revenue,driven by increased product usage by new and

existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody.

Finally,commissions revenue increased,due mainly to higher broker-

age transaction volume (primarily included within Fixed Income and

Equity Markets revenue of IB),which more than offset the sale of the

insurance business by RFS in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge

in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of

customer annuities.For additional information on these fees and

commissions,see the segment discussions for IB on pages 54Œ56,

RFS on pages 57Œ62,TSS on pages 68Œ69,and AM on pages 70Œ72

of this Annual Report.
The favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 com-
pared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improve-

ments in the results of repositioning of the Corporate investment

securities portfolio.Also contributing to the positive variance was a

$234 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares.For a further

discussion of securities gains (losses),which are mostly recorded in

the Firm™s Corporate business,see the Corporate/Private Equity seg-

ment discussion on pages 73Œ75 of this Annual Report.
offset by markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and increased
reserves related to the repurchase of previously sold loans.For a dis-

cussion of mortgage fees and related income,which is recorded pri-

marily in RFS™s Consumer Lending business,see the Consumer

Lending discussion on pages 59Œ62 of this Annual Report.
Credit card income rose compared with the prior year,driven by
increased interchange income due to higher customer charge volume
in CS and higher debit card transaction volume in RFS,the impact of

the Washington Mutual transaction,and increased servicing fees

resulting from a higher level of securitized receivables.These results

were partially offset by increases in volume-driven payments to part-
ners and expense related to rewards programs.For a further discus-

sion of credit card income,see CS™ segment results on pages 63Œ65

of this Annual Report.
Other income increased compared with the prior year,due predomi-
nantly to the proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public

offering of $1.5 billion,the gain on the dissolution of the Chase

Paymentech Solutions joint venture of $1.0 billion,and gains on

sales of certain other assets.These proceeds and gains were partially

offset by markdowns on certain investments,including seed capital

in AM;a $464 million charge related to the offer to repurchase auc-

tion-rate securities at par;losses of $423 million reflecting the Firm™s

49.4% ownership in Bear Stearns™ losses from April 8 to May 30,

2008;and lower securitization income at CS.
Net interest income rose from the prior year,due predominantly to
the following:higher trading-related net interest income in IB,the

impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,wider net interest

spread in Corporate/Private Equity,growth in liability and deposit

balances in the wholesale and RFS businesses,higher consumer and

wholesale loan balances,and wider spreads on consumer loans in

RFS.The Firm™s total average interest-earning assets for 2008 were

$1.4 trillion,up 23% from the prior year,driven by higher loans,

available-for-sale (ﬁAFSﬂ) securities,securities borrowed,brokerage

receivables and other interest-earning assets balances.The Firm™s

total average interest-bearing liabilities for 2008 were $1.3 trillion,

up 24% from the prior year,driven by higher deposits,long-term

debt,brokerage payables and other borrowings balances.The net

interest yield on the Firm™s interest-earning assets,on a fully taxable

equivalent basis,was 2.87%,an increase of 48 basis points from the

prior year.
2007 compared with 2006 
Total net revenue of $71.4 billion was up $9.4 billion,or 15%,from

the prior year.Higher net interest income,very strong private equity

gains,record asset management,administration and commissions

revenue,higher mortgage fees and related income,and record

investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth.These

increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue.
Investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre-vious record set in 2006.Record advisory and equity underwriting

fees drove the results,partially offset by lower debt underwriting

fees.For a further discussion of investment banking fees,which are

primarily recorded in IB,see IB segment results on pages 54Œ56 of

this Annual Report.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
46Management’s discussion and analysis
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
47Mortgage fees and related income increased from the prior year as
MSRs asset valuation adjustments and growth in third-party mort-

gage loans serviced drove an increase in net mortgage servicing rev-
enue.Production revenue also grew,as an increase in mortgage loan

originations and the classification of certain loan origination costs as
expense (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue
commenced being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of
2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159) more than offset markdowns

on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline.For a discussion of mort-

gage fees and related income,which is recorded primarily in RFS™

Consumer Lending business,see the Consumer Lending discussion

on pages 59Œ62 of this Annual Report.
Credit card income remained relatively unchanged from the 2006level,as lower servicing fees earned in connection with securitization

activities,which were affected unfavorably by higher net credit losses

and narrower loan margins,were offset by increases in net inter-

change income earned on the Firm™s credit and debit cards.For fur-

ther discussion of credit card income,see CS™ segment results on

pages 63Œ65 of this Annual Report.
Other income declined compared with the prior year,driven by lower
gains from loan sales and workouts,and the absence of a $103 mil-

lion gain in the second quarter of 2006 related to the sale of
MasterCard shares in its initial public offering.(The 2007 gain on the

sale of MasterCard shares was recorded in securities gains (losses) as

the shares were transferred to the AFS portfolio subsequent to the

IPO.) Increased income from automobile operating leases and higher

gains on the sale of leveraged leases and student loans partially off-

set the decline.
Net interest income rose from the prior year,primarily due to the fol-
lowing:higher trading-related net interest income,due to a shift of

Interest expense to principal transactions revenue (related to certain

IB structured notes to which fair value accounting was elected in

connection with the adoption of SFAS 159);growth in liability and

deposit balances in the wholesale and consumer businesses;a higher

level of credit card loans;the impact of the Bank of New York trans-

action;and an improvement in Corporate™s net interest spread.The

Firm™s total average interest-earning assets for 2007 were $1.1 tril-

lion,up 12% from the prior year.The increase was primarily driven

by higher trading assets Œ debt instruments,loans,and AFS securi-

ties,partially offset by a decline in interests in purchased receivables

as a result of the restructuring and deconsolidation during the sec-
ond quarter of 2006 of certain multi-seller conduits that the Firm
administered.The net interest yield on these assets,on a fully taxable

equivalent basis,was 2.39%,an increase of 23 basis points from the

prior year,due in part to the adoption of SFAS 159.

(b)On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of
Washington Mutual Bank.On May 30,2008,the Bear Stearns merger was consum-

mated.Each of these transactions was accounted for as a purchase and their respective

results of operations are included in the Firm™s results from each respective transaction

date.For additional information on these transactions,see Note 2 on pages 135Œ140

of this Annual Report.
2008 compared with 2007 
The provision for credit losses in 2008 rose by $14.1 billion com-

pared with the prior year due to increases in both the consumer and
wholesale provisions.The increase in the consumer provision reflect-

ed higher estimated losses for home equity and mortgages resulting
from declining housing prices;an increase in estimated losses for the

auto,student and business banking loan portfolios;and an increase

in the allowance for loan losses and higher charge-offs of credit card

loans.The increase in the wholesale provision was driven by a higher

allowance resulting from a weakening credit environment and

growth in retained loans.The wholesale provision in the first quarter

of 2008 also included the effect of the transfer of $4.9 billion of

funded and unfunded leveraged lending commitments to retained

loans from held-for-sale.In addition,in 2008 both the consumer and

wholesale provisions were affected by a $1.5 billion charge to con-
form assets acquired from Washington Mutual to the Firm™s loan loss

methodologies.For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio

and the allowance for loan losses,see the segment discussions for

RFS on pages 57Œ62,CS on pages 63Œ65,IB on pages 54Œ56 and

CB on pages 66Œ67,and the Credit Risk Management section on

pages 92Œ111 of this Annual Report.
2007 compared with 2006 
The provision for credit losses in 2007 rose $3.6 billion from the prior

year due to increases in both the consumer and wholesale provisions.

The increase in the consumer provision from the prior year was largely

due to an increase in estimated losses related to home equity,credit

card and subprime mortgage loans.Credit card net charge-offs in

2006 benefited following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the
fourth quarter of 2005.The increase in the wholesale provision from

the prior year primarily reflected an increase in the allowance for
Management’s discussion and analysis
48JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
defaults in RFS;an increase in technology,communications and
equipment expense reflecting higher depreciation expense on owned
automobiles subject to operating leases in RFS,and other technolo-

gy-related investments across the businesses;and,an increase in

occupancy expense partly for the expansion of RFS™ retail distribution
network.For a further discussion of amortization of intangibles,refer

to Note 18 on pages 198Œ201 of this Annual Report.
For information on merger costs,refer to Note 11 on page 170 of
this Annual Report.
2007 compared with 2006 
Total noninterest expense for 2007 was $41.7 billion,up $2.9 bil-

lion,or 7%,from the prior year.The increase was driven by higher

compensation expense,as well as investments across the business

segments and acquisitions.
The increase in compensation expense from 2006 was primarily the
result of investments and acquisitions in the businesses,including

additional headcount from the Bank of New York transaction;the

classification of certain private equity carried interest from principal

transactions revenue;the classification of certain loan origination

costs (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue com-
menced being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007
due to the adoption of SFAS 159);and higher performance-based

incentives.Partially offsetting these increases were business divesti-

tures and continuing business efficiencies.
Noncompensation expense increased from 2006 due to higher profes-sional & outside services primarily reflecting higher brokerage expense

and credit card processing costs resulting from growth in transaction

volume,as well as investments in the businesses and acquisitions.

Also contributing to the increase was higher other expense due to

increased net legal-related costs,reflecting a lower level of insurance

recoveries and increased costs of credit card-related litigation,and

other increases driven by business growth and investments in the
businesses.Other noncompensation expense increases also included

higher occupancy expense driven by ongoing investments in the busi-
nesses,in particular,the retail distribution network and the Bank of

New York transaction;and higher technology,communications and

equipment expense due primarily to higher depreciation expense on
owned automobiles subject to operating leases in RFS,and other

technology-related investments in the businesses to support business

growth.These increases were offset partially by lower credit card mar-

keting expense;decreases due to the sale of the insurance business at

the beginning of the third quarter of 2006 and lower credit card
fraud-related losses,both in other expense.In addition,expense in

general was reduced by the effect of continuing business efficiencies.

transactions was accounted for as a purchase and their respective results of operations are

included in the Firm™s results from each respective transaction date.For additional information

on these transactions,see Note 2 on pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report.
2008 compared with 2007 
Total noninterest expense for 2008 was $43.5 billion,up $1.8 bil-

lion,or 4%,from the prior year.The increase was driven by the addi-

tional operating costs related to the Washington Mutual transaction

and Bear Stearns merger,and investments in the businesses,partially

offset by lower performance-based incentives.
Compensation expense increased slightly from the prior year pre-
dominantly driven by investments in the businesses,including head-

count additions associated with the Bear Stearns merger and
Washington Mutual transaction,largely offset by lower performance-

based incentives.
Noncompensation expense increased from the prior year as a result
of the Bear Stearns merger and Washington Mutual transaction.

Excluding the effect of these transactions,noncompensation expense

decreased due to a net reduction in other expense related to litiga-
tion;lower credit card and consumer lending marketing expense;and

a decrease in the amortization of intangibles as certain purchased
credit card relationships were fully amortized in 2007 and the amor-
tization rate for core deposit intangibles declined in accordance with

the amortization schedule.These decreases were offset partially by

increases in professional & outside services,driven by investments in

new product platforms in TSS,business and volume growth in CS

credit card processing and IB brokerage,clearing and exchange

transaction processing.Also contributing to the increases were an

increase in other expense due to higher mortgage reinsurance losses

and mortgage servicing expense due to increased delinquencies andwww.global-reports.com

on these transactions,see Note 2 on pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report.
2008 compared with 2007 
The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008 compared with the

prior year was the result of significantly lower reported pretax

income combined with changes in the proportion of income subject
to U.S.federal taxes.Also contributing to the decrease in the effec-

tive tax rate was increased business tax credits and the realization 

of a $1.1 billion benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities.

These deferred tax liabilities were associated with the undistributed

earnings of certain non-U.S.subsidiaries that were deemed to be

reinvested indefinitely.These decreases were partially offset by

changes in state and local taxes,and equity losses representing the

Firm™s 49.4% ownership interest in Bear Stearns™ losses from April 8

to May 30,2008,for which no income tax benefit was recorded.

For a further discussion of income taxes,see Critical Accounting

Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 119Œ123 and Note 28 on
pages 209Œ211 of this Annual Report.
2007 compared with 2006 
The increase in the effective tax rate for 2007,as compared with the

prior year,was primarily the result of higher reported pretax income

combined with changes in the proportion of income subject to feder-
al,state and local taxes.Also contributing to the increase in the

effective tax rate was the recognition in 2006 of $367 million of

benefits related to the resolution of tax audits.
Income from discontinued operations 
As a result of the transaction with The Bank of New York on October

1,2006,the results of operations of the selected corporate trust busi-

nesses (i.e.,trustee,paying agent,loan agency and document manage-

ment services) were reported as discontinued operations.
Income from discontinued operations in 2006 was due predominantly
to a gain of $622 million from exiting selected corporate trust busi-

nesses in the fourth quarter of 2006.No income from discontinued

operations was recorded in 2008 or 2007.
Extraordinary gain 
The Firm recorded an extraordinary gain of $1.9 billion in 2008 asso-

ciated with the acquisition of the banking operations of Washington

Mutual.The transaction is being accounted for under the purchase

method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141.The adjusted fair

value of net assets of the banking operations,after purchase account-

ing adjustments,was higher than JPMorgan Chase™s purchase price.

There were no extraordinary gains recorded in 2007 or 2006.
sheet and presents revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent (ﬁFTEﬂ)
basis.These adjustments do not have any impact on net income as

reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole.
The presentation of CS results on a managed basis assumes that
credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance
with SFAS 140 remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and that

the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same man-
ner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis

to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance

of the entire managed credit card portfolio.Operations are funded

ees and capital,based upon managed financial information.In addi-

tion,the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
51are used for both loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets andsecuritized loans.Although securitizations result in the sale of credit

card receivables to a trust,JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing cus-

tomer relationships,as the customers may continue to use their cred-

it cards;accordingly,the customer™s credit performance will affect

both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.JPMorgan Chase believes managed

basis information is useful to investors,enabling them to understand

both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Firm™s retained interests in

securitized loans.For a reconciliation of reported to managed basis

results for CS,see CS segment results on pages 63Œ65 of this Annual

Report.For information regarding the securitization process,and

loans and residual interests sold and securitized,see Note 16 on

pages 180Œ188 of this Annual Report.
Total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is
presented on a FTE basis.Accordingly,revenue from tax-exempt

securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the

managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and

investments.This non-GAAP financial measure allows management

to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and

tax-exempt sources.The corresponding income tax impact related to

these items is recorded within income tax expense.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at thebusiness segment level because it believes these other non-GAAP
financial measures provide information to investors about the under-
lying operational performance and trends of the particular business

segment and therefore facilitate a comparison of the business seg-
ment with the performance of its competitors.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 
The Firm is managed on a line-of-business basis.The business seg-
ment financial results presented reflect the current organization of
JPMorgan Chase.There are six major reportable business segments:

the Investment Bank,Retail Financial Services,Card Services,

Commercial Banking,Treasury & Securities Services and Asset

Management,as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment.
The business segments are determined based upon the products and
services provided,or the type of customer served,and they reflect

the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by

management.Results of these lines of business are presented on a

managed basis.

Securities ServicesBusiness segment changes Commencing October 1,2008,RFS was reorganized into the follow-

ing two reporting segments:Retail Banking and Consumer Lending.

Previously,RFS consisted of three reporting segments:Regional

Banking,Mortgage Banking and Auto Finance.The new Retail

Banking reporting segment now comprises consumer banking and
business banking activities,which previously were reported in

Regional Banking.The new Consumer Lending reporting segment

now comprises:(a) the prior Mortgage Banking and Auto Finance

reporting segments,(b) the home equity,student and other lending

business activities which were previously reported in the Regional
Banking reporting segment and (c) loan activity related to prime
mortgages that were originated by RFS,but reported in the

Corporate/Private Equity business segment.This reorganization is

reflected in this Annual Report and the financial information for prior

periods has been revised to reflect the changes as if they had been
in effect throughout all periods reported.Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to reflect each seg-
ment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business.The manage-

ment reporting process that derives business segment results allo-
cates income and expense using market-based methodologies.
Business segment reporting methodologies used by the Firm are dis-cussed below.The Firm continues to assess the assumptions,

methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment report-
ing,and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.
Revenue sharing When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm™s clients,the participating business segments agree to share

revenue from those transactions.The segment results reflect these

revenue-sharing agreements.
Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing is used to allocate interest income and

expense to each business and transfer the primary interest rate risk

exposures to the Treasury group within the Corporate/Private Equity

business segment.The allocation process is unique to each business

segment and considers the interest rate risk,liquidity risk and regula-

tory requirements of that segment™s stand-alone peers.This process is

overseen by the Firm™s Asset-Liability Committee (ﬁALCOﬂ).Business

segments may retain certain interest rate exposures,subject to man-

agement approval,that would be expected in the normal operation

of a similar peer business.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
53Capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into considera-
tion stand-alone peer comparisons,economic risk measures and reg-

ulatory capital requirements.The amount of capital assigned to each

business is referred to as equity.Line of business equity increased

during the second quarter of 2008 in IB and AM due to the Bear

Stearns merger and,for AM,the purchase of the additional equity

interest in Highbridge.At the end of the third quarter of 2008,equity

was increased for each line of business with a view toward the

future implementation of the new Basel II capital rules.For further

details on these rules,see Basel II on page 84 of this Annual Report.

In addition,equity allocated to RFS,CS and CB was increased as a

result of the Washington Mutual transaction.For a further discussion,

see Capital managementŒLine of business equity on page 82 of this
Annual Report.Expense allocation Where business segments use services provided by support units
within the Firm,the costs of those support units are allocated to the

business segments.The expense is allocated based upon their actual

cost or the lower of actual cost or market,as well as upon usage of

the services provided.In contrast,certain other expense related to

certain corporate functions,or to certain technology and operations,

are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in
Corporate.Retained expense includes:parent company costs that

would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses;
adjustments to align certain corporate staff,technology and opera-

tions allocations with market prices;and other one-time items not

aligned with the business segments.

respectively,compared with $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion,respectively,in 2007.
(b) All other income for 2008 decreased from the prior year due to increased revenue
sharing agreements with other business segments.All other income for 2007

decreased from the prior year due mainly to losses on loan sales and lower gains on
sales of assets.
(c)Net interest income for 2008 increased from the prior year due to an increase in inter-
est-earning assets,including the addition of the Bear Stearns™ Prime Services business

combined with wider spreads on certain fixed income products.The increase in 2007

from the prior year was due primarily to an increase in interest-earning assets.

2008 compared with 2007 
Net loss was $1.2 billion,a decrease of $4.3 billion from the prior

year,driven by lower total net revenue,a higher provision for credit

losses and higher noninterest expense,partially offset by a reduction

in deferred tax liabilities on overseas earnings.
Total net revenue was $12.2 billion,down $6.0 billion,or 33%,from
the prior year.Investment banking fees were $5.9 billion,down 11%

from the prior year,driven by lower debt underwriting and advisory

fees reflecting reduced market activity.Debt underwriting fees were

$2.2 billion,down 18% from the prior year,driven by lower loan

syndication and bond underwriting fees.Advisory fees of $2.0 billion

declined 12% from the prior year.Equity underwriting fees were

$1.7 billion,up 2% from the prior year driven by improved market

share.Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.0 billion,compared

with $6.3 billion in the prior year.The decrease was driven by $5.9

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
55billion of net markdowns on mortgage-related exposures and $4.7billion of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded

commitments.Revenue was also adversely impacted by additional

losses and cost to risk reduce related to Bear Stearns™ positions.

These results were offset by record performance in rates and curren-

cies,credit trading,commodities and emerging markets as well as

$814 million of gains from the widening of the Firm™s credit spread

on certain structured liabilities and derivatives.Equity Markets rev-

enue was $3.6 billion,down 7% from the prior year,reflecting weak

trading results,partially offset by strong client revenue across prod-

ucts including prime services,as well as $510 million of gains from

the widening of the Firm™s credit spread on certain structured liabili-

ties and derivatives.Credit portfolio revenue was $739 million,down

44%,driven by losses from widening counterparty credit spreads.
The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion,an increase of $1.4
billion from the prior year,predominantly reflecting a higher

allowance for credit losses,driven by a weakening credit environ-

ment,as well as the effect of the transfer of $4.9 billion of funded

and unfunded leveraged lending commitments to retained loans

from held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2008.Net charge-offs for the

year were $105 million,compared with $36 million in the prior year.

Total nonperforming assets were $2.5 billion,an increase of $2.0 bil-

lion compared with the prior year,reflecting a weakening credit envi-

ronment.The allowance for loan losses to average loans was 4.71%

for 2008,compared with a ratio of 2.14% in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion,up $770 million,or 6%,from
the prior year,reflecting higher noncompensation expense driven pri-

marily by additional expense relating to the Bear Stearns merger,off-

set partially by lower performance-based compensation expense.
Return on equity was a negative 5% on $26.1 billion of average allo-
cated capital,compared with 15% on $21.0 billion in the prior year.
2007 compared with 2006 
Net income was $3.1 billion,a decrease of $535 million,or 15%,

from the prior year.The decrease reflected lower fixed income rev-

enue,a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest

expense,partially offset by record investment banking fees and equity

markets revenue.
Total net revenue was $18.2 billion,down $663 million,or 4%,from
the prior year.Investment banking fees were $6.6 billion,up 19%

from the prior year,driven by record fees across advisory and equity

underwriting,partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees.

Advisory fees were $2.3 billion,up 37%,and equity underwriting

fees were $1.7 billion,up 45%;both were driven by record perform-

ance across all regions.Debt underwriting fees of $2.6 billion

declined 3%,reflecting lower loan syndication and bond underwrit-

ing fees,which were negatively affected by market conditions in the

second half of the year.Fixed Income Markets revenue decreased

27% from the prior year.The decrease was due to net markdowns of

$1.4 billion on subprime positions,including subprime CDOs and net

markdowns of $1.3 billion on leveraged lending funded loans and

unfunded commitments.Fixed Income Markets revenue also

decreased due to markdowns in securitized products on nonsub-
prime mortgages and weak credit trading performance.These lower
results were offset partially by record revenue in currencies andstrong revenue in rates.Equity Markets revenue was $3.9 billion,up

13%,benefiting from strong client activity and record trading results

across all products.Credit Portfolio revenue was $1.3 billion,up

19%,primarily due to higher revenue from risk management activi-

ties,partially offset by lower gains from loan sales and workouts.
The provision for credit losses was $654 million,an increase of $463
million from the prior year.The change was due to a net increase of

$532 million in the allowance for credit losses,primarily due to port-

folio activity,which included the effect of a weakening credit envi-

ronment,and an increase in allowance for unfunded leveraged lend-

ing commitments,as well as portfolio growth.In addition,there were

$36 million of net charge-offs in 2007,compared with $31 million of

net recoveries in the prior year.The allowance for loan losses to aver-

age loans was 2.14% for 2007,compared with a ratio of 1.79% in

the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $13.1 billion,up $214 million,or 2%,from
the prior year.
Return on equity was 15% on $21.0 billion of allocated capital com-
pared with 18% on $20.8 billion in 2006.Selected metricsYear ended December 31,

other purposes;(4) goodwill and intangibles;(5) securities received as collateral;

and (6) investments purchased under the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money

Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.The amount of adjusted assets is presented to

assist the reader in comparing IB™s asset and capital levels to other investment

banks in the securities industry.Asset-to-equity leverage ratios are commonly used

as one measure to assess a company™s capital adequacy.IB believes an adjusted

asset amount that excludes the assets discussed above,which were considered to

have a low risk profile,provides a more meaningful measure of balance sheet lever-

age in the securities industry.

(e)Average VaRs were less than the sum of the VaRs of their market risk components,
which was due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.The diversification

effect reflected the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.The risk of a port-

folio of positions is usually less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves.
(f)Trading VaR includes predominantly all trading activities in IB;however,particular risk
parameters of certain products are not fully captured,for example,correlation risk.

Trading VaR does not include VaR related to held-for-sale funded loans and unfunded

commitments,nor the debit valuation adjustments (ﬁDVAﬂ) taken on derivative and

structured liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the Firm.See the DVA Sensitivity

table on page 115 of this Annual Report for further details.Trading VaR also does not

include the MSR portfolio or VaR related to other corporate functions,such as

Corporate/Private Equity.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008,trading VaR

includes the estimated credit spread sensitivity of certain mortgage products.
(g)Included VaR on derivative credit valuation adjustments (ﬁCVAﬂ),hedges of the CVA
and mark-to-market hedges of the retained loan portfolio,which were all reported in

principal transactions revenue.This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio.
(h) Excluding the impact of a loan originated in March 2008 to Bear Stearns,the
adjusted ratio would be 4.84% for 2008.The average balance of the loan extended

to Bear Stearns was $1.9 billion for 2008.The allowance for loan losses to period-

end loans was 4.83% and 1.92% at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
57RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES
On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking
operations of Washington Mutual from the FDIC for $1.9 billion

through a purchase of substantially all of the assets and assumption
of specified liabilities of Washington Mutual.Washington Mutual™s

banking operations consisted of a retail bank network of 2,244

branches,a nationwide credit card lending business,a multi-family

and commercial real estate lending business,and nationwide mort-

gage banking activities.The transaction expanded the Firm™s U.S.

consumer branch network in California,Florida,Washington,

Georgia,Idaho,Nevada and Oregon and created the nation™s third-

largest branch network.
During the first quarter of 2006,RFS completed the purchase of
Collegiate Funding Services,which contributed a student loan servic-

ing capability and provided an entry into the Federal Family

Education Loan Program consolidation market.On July 1,2006,RFS

sold its life insurance and annuity underwriting businesses to

Protective Life Corporation.On October 1,2006,JPMorgan Chase

completed the Bank of New York transaction,significantly strength-

ening RFS™ distribution network in the New York tri-state area.

(a) The Firm adopted SFAS 159 in the first quarter of 2007.As a result,beginning in
the first quarter of 2007,certain loan-origination costs have been classified as

expense.
(b) Retail Financial Services uses the overhead ratio (excluding the amortization of core
deposit intangibles (ﬁCDIﬂ)),a non-GAAP financial measure,to evaluate the under-

lying expense trends of the business.Including CDI amortization expense in the

overhead ratio calculation results in a higher overhead ratio in the earlier years and

a lower overhead ratio in later years;this method would result in an improving

overhead ratio over time,all things remaining equal.This non-GAAP ratio excludes

Retail Banking™s core deposit intangible amortization expense related to the Bank of

New York transaction and the Bank One merger of $394 million,$460 million and

$458 million for the years ended December 31,2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.
2008 compared with 2007 
Net income was $880 million,a decrease of $2.0 billion,or 70%,

from the prior year,as a significant increase in the provision for cred-

it losses was partially offset by positive MSR risk management results

and the positive impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.
Total net revenue was $23.5 billion,an increase of $6.2 billion,or
36%,from the prior year.Net interest income was $14.2 billion,up

$3.6 billion,or 35%,benefiting from the Washington Mutual trans-

action,wider loan and deposit spreads,and higher loan and deposit

balances.Noninterest revenue was $9.4 billion,up $2.6 billion,or

38%,as positive MSR risk management results,the impact of the

Washington Mutual transaction,higher mortgage origination volume

and higher deposit-related fees were partially offset by an increase in
reserves related to the repurchase of previously sold loans and mark-
downs on the mortgage warehouse.
The provision for credit losses was $9.9 billion,an increase of $7.3
billion from the prior year.Delinquency rates have increased due to

overall weak economic conditions,while housing price declines have

continued to drive increased loss severities,particularly for high loan-

to-value home equity and mortgage loans.The provision includes $4.7

billion in additions to the allowance for loan losses for the heritage

Chase home equity and mortgage portfolios.Home equity net charge-

offs were $2.4 billion (2.23% net charge-off rate;2.39% excluding

purchased credit-impaired loans),compared with $564 million

(0.62% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.Subprime mortgage net

charge-offs were $933 million (5.49% net charge-off rate;6.10%

excluding purchased credit-impaired loans),compared with $157 mil-

lion (1.55% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.Prime mortgage net

charge-offs were $526 million (1.05% net charge-off rate;1.18%

excluding purchased credit-impaired loans),compared with $33 mil-

lion (0.13% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.The provision for

credit losses was also affected by an increase in estimated losses for

the auto,student and business banking loan portfolios.
Retail Financial Services,which includes the Retail Banking

and Consumer Lending reporting segments,serves con-

sumers and businesses through multiple channels.

Customers can use more than 5,400 bank branches (third-

largest nationally),14,500 ATMs (second-largest nationally)

as well as online and mobile banking.More than 21,400

branch salespeople assist customers with checking and

savings accounts,mortgages,home equity and business

loans,and investments across the 23-state footprint from

New York and Florida to California.Consumers also can

obtain loans through more than 16,000 auto dealerships

and 4,800 schools and universities nationwide.

ment agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program of $437 million,

$417 million and $387 million at December 31,2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.

These amounts were excluded,as reimbursement is proceeding normally.
Total noninterest expense was $12.1 billion,an increase of $2.2 bil-
lion,or 22%,from the prior year,reflecting the impact of the

Washington Mutual transaction,higher mortgage reinsurance losses,

higher mortgage servicing expense and investments in the retail dis-
tribution network.2007 compared with 2006 
Net income was $2.9 billion,a decrease of $288 million,or 9%,

from the prior year,as a decline in Consumer Lending was offset par-

tially by improved results in Retail Banking.Total net revenue was $17.3 billion,an increase of $2.5 billion,or
17%,from the prior year.Net interest income was $10.5 billion,up

$361 million,or 4%,due to the Bank of New York transaction,wider

loan spreads and higher deposit balances.These benefits were offset

partially by the sale of the insurance business and a shift to narrow-

erŒspread deposit products.Noninterest revenue was $6.8 billion,up

$2.1 billion,benefiting from positive MSR risk management results;

an increase in deposit-related fees;and the absence of a prior-year

$233 million loss related to $13.3 billion of mortgage loans trans-

ferred to held-for-sale.Noninterest revenue also benefited from the

classification of certain mortgage loan origination costs as expense
(loan origination costs previously netted against revenue commenced
being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007 due to the
adoption of SFAS 159).
The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion,compared with $561
million in the prior year.The current year provision includes a net

increase of $1.0 billion in the allowance for loan losses related to

home equity loans as continued weak housing prices have resulted
in an increase in estimated losses for high loan-to-value loans.Home

equity net charge-offs were $564 million (0.62% net charge-off
rate),compared with $143 million (0.18% net charge-off rate) in the

prior year.In addition,the current-year provision includes a $166 mil-

lion increase in the allowance for loan losses related to subprime

mortgage loans,reflecting an increase in estimated losses and

growth in the portfolio.Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were

$157 million (1.55% net charge-off rate),compared with $47 million

(0.34% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.
Total noninterest expense was $9.9 billion,an increase of $978 mil-
lion,or 11%,from the prior year due to the Bank of New York trans-

action;the classification of certain loan origination costs as expense

due to the adoption of SFAS 159;investments in the retail distribu-

tion network;and higher mortgage production and servicing

expense.These increases were offset partially by the sale of the

insurance business.

59(e) During the second quarter of 2008,the policy for classifying subprime mortgage
and home equity loans as nonperforming was changed to conform to all other

home lending products.Amounts for 2007 have been revised to reflect this change.

Amounts for 2006 have not been revised as the impact was not material.
(f) Loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for at fair value were excluded when calcu-
lating the allowance coverage ratio and the net charge-off rate.
(g) Excludes the impact of purchased credit-impaired loans accounted for under SOP
03-3 that were acquired as part of the Washington Mutual transaction at December

31,2008.These loans were accounted for at fair value on the acquisition date,

which included the impact of credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio.

Accordingly,no allowance for loan losses has been recorded for these loans.

2008 compared with 2007 
Consumer Lending net loss was $2.1 billion,compared with net

income of $680 million in the prior year.Total net revenue was $10.9

billion,up $3.6 billion,or 48%,driven by higher mortgage fees and

related income (due primarily to positive MSR risk management
results),the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,higher

loan balances and wider loan spreads.
The increase in mortgage fees and related income was primarily driv-
en by higher net mortgage servicing revenue.Mortgage production

revenue of $898 million was up $18 million,as higher mortgage

origination volume was predominantly offset by an increase in

reserves related to the repurchase of previously sold loans and mark-
downs of the mortgage warehouse.Net mortgage servicing revenue

(which includes loan servicing revenue,MSR risk management results

and other changes in fair value) was $2.7 billion,an increase of $1.5

billion,or 124%,from the prior year.Loan servicing revenue was

$3.3 billion,an increase of $924 million.Third-party loans serviced

increased 91%,primarily due to the Washington Mutual transaction.

MSR risk management results were $1.5 billion,compared with

$411 million in the prior year.Other changes in fair value of the MSR

asset were negative $2.1 billion,compared with negative $1.5 bil-

lion in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $9.5 billion,compared with $2.5
billion in the prior year.The provision reflected weakness in the home

equity and mortgage portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discus-
sion of the provision for credit losses for further detail).Noninterest expense was $4.8 billion,up $1.1 billion,or 30%,from
the prior year,reflecting higher mortgage reinsurance losses,the

impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher servicing

expense due to increased delinquencies and defaults.
2007 compared with 2006 
Consumer Lending net income was $680 million,a decrease of $611

million,or 47%,from the prior year.Total net revenue was $7.3 bil-

lion,up $1.5 billion,or 25%,benefiting from positive MSR risk man-

agement results,increased mortgage production revenue,wider loan

spreads and the absence of a prior-year $233 million loss related to

$13.3 billion of mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale.These

benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business.
Mortgage production revenue was $880 million,up $576 million,
reflecting the impact of an increase in mortgage loan originations
and the classification of certain loan origination costs as expense
(loan origination costs previously netted against revenue commenced
being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007 due to the
adoption of SFAS 159).These benefits were offset partially by mark-

downs of $241 million on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline.Net

mortgage servicing revenue,which includes loan servicing revenue,

MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value,was

$1.2 billion,compared with $314 million in the prior year.Loan serv-

icing revenue of $2.3 billion increased $195 million on 17% growth
in third-party loans serviced.MSR risk management results were pos-

itive $411 million compared with negative $385 million in the prior
year.Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were negative

$1.5 billion,compared with negative $1.4 billion in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion,compared with $447
million in the prior year.The increase in the provision was due to the

home equity and subprime mortgage portfolios (see Retail Financial
Services discussion of the provision for credit losses for further detail).Noninterest expense was $3.7 billion,an increase of $479 million,or
15%.The increase reflected the classification of certain loan origina-

tion costs due to the adoption of SFAS 159;higher servicing costs

due to increased delinquencies and defaults;higher production

expense due to growth in originations;and increased depreciation

expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases.These

increases were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
63CARD SERVICES
JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of ﬁmanaged basisﬂto evaluate
the credit performance of its credit card loans,both loans on the bal-

ance sheet and loans that have been securitized.For further informa-

tion,see Explanation and reconciliation of the Firm™s use of non-

GAAP financial measures on pages 50Œ51 of this Annual Report.

Managed results exclude the impact of credit card securitizations on
total net revenue,the provision for credit losses,net charge-offs and

loan receivables.Securitization does not change reported net income;

however,it does affect the classification of items on the Consolidated

Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following discussion of CS™ financial results reflects the acquisi-
tion of Washington Mutual™s credit card operations,including $28.3

billion of managed credit card loans,as a result of the Washington

Mutual transaction on September 25,2008,and the dissolution of

the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture on November 1,2008.

2008 compared with 2007 
Net income was $780 million,a decline of $2.1 billion,or 73%,from

the prior year.The decrease was driven by a higher provision for

credit losses,partially offset by higher total net revenue.
Average managed loans were $162.9 billion,an increase of $13.5
billion,or 9%,from the prior year.Excluding Washington Mutual,

average managed loans were $155.9 billion.End-of-period managed

loans were $190.3 billion,an increase of $33.3 billion,or 21%,from

the prior year.Excluding Washington Mutual,end-of-period managed

loans were $162.1 billion.The increases in both average managed

loans and end-of-period managed loans were predominantly due to
the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and organic portfo-

lio growth.Managed total net revenue was $16.5 billion,an increase of $1.2
billion,or 8%,from the prior year.Net interest income was $13.8

billion,up $1.6 billion,or 13%,from the prior year,driven by the

Washington Mutual transaction,higher average managed loan bal-

ances,and wider loan spreads.These benefits were offset partially by

the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-
offs.Noninterest revenue was $2.7 billion,a decrease of $327 mil-

lion,or 11%,from the prior year,driven by increased rewards

expense,lower securitization income driven by higher credit losses,

and higher volume-driven payments to partners;these were largely

offset by increased interchange income,benefiting from a 4%

increase in charge volume,as well as the impact of the Washington

Mutual transaction.

64JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
2007 compared with 2006 
Net income of $2.9 billion was down $287 million,or 9%,from the

prior year.Prior-year results benefited from significantly lower net

charge-offs following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the
fourth quarter of 2005.The increase in net charge-offs was offset

partially by higher revenue.
End-of-period managed loans of $157.1 billion increased $4.2 bil-lion,or 3%,from the prior year.Average managed loans of $149.3

billion increased $8.2 billion,or 6%,from the prior year.The increas-

es in both end-of-period and average managed loans resulted from

organic growth.Managed total net revenue was $15.2 billion,an increase of $490
million,or 3%,from the prior year.Net interest income was $12.2

billion,up $388 million,or 3%,from the prior year.The increase in

net interest income was driven by a higher level of fees and higher

average loan balances.These benefits were offset partially by nar-

rower loan spreads,the discontinuation of certain billing practices

(including the elimination of certain over-limit fees and the two-cycle

billing method for calculating finance charges beginning in the sec-
ond quarter of 2007) and the effect of higher revenue reversals asso-ciated with higher charge-offs.Noninterest revenue was $3.0 billion,
an increase of $102 million,or 3%,from the prior year.The increase

reflected a higher level of fee-based revenue and increased net inter-
change income,which benefited from higher charge volume.Charge

volume growth was 4%,reflecting a 9% increase in sales volume,

offset primarily by a lower level of balance transfers,the result of

more targeted marketing efforts.
The managed provision for credit losses was $5.7 billion,an increase
of $1.1 billion,or 24%,from the prior year.The increase was primari-

ly due to a higher level of net charge-offs (the prior year benefited
from the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of
2005) and an increase in the allowance for loan losses,driven by

higher estimated net charge-offs in the portfolio.The managed net

charge-off rate was 3.68%,up from 3.33% in the prior year.The 30-

day managed delinquency rate was 3.48%,up from 3.13% in the

prior year.
Noninterest expense was $4.9 billion,a decrease of $172 million,or
3%,compared with the prior year,primarily due to lower marketing

expense and lower fraud-related expense,partially offset by higher

volume-related expense.

2008 compared with 2007 
Net income was $1.4 billion,an increase of $305 million,or 27%,

from the prior year,due to growth in total net revenue including the

impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,partially offset by a

higher provision for credit losses.
Record total net revenue of $4.8 billion increased $674 million,or
16%.Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $456 million,or

16%,driven by double-digit growth in liability and loan balances

and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,partially offset

by spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios.Noninterest

revenue was $1.5 billion,up $218 million,or 17%,due to higher

deposit and lending-related fees.
On a client segment basis,Middle Market Banking revenue was $2.9
billion,an increase of $250 million,or 9%,from the prior year due

predominantly to higher deposit-related fees and growth in liability
and loan balances.Revenue from Commercial Term Lending,a new

client segment established as a result of the Washington Mutual

transaction encompassing multi-family and commercial mortgage

loans,was $243 million.Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was $921

million,an increase of $106 million,or 13%,reflecting higher loan

balances,investment banking revenue,and deposit-related fees.Real

Estate Banking revenue of $413 million decreased $8 million,or 2%.
Provision for credit losses was $464 million,an increase of $185 mil-
lion,or 66%,compared with the prior year,reflecting a weakening

credit environment and loan growth.Net charge-offs were $288 mil-

lion (0.35% net charge-off rate),compared with $44 million (0.07%

net charge-off rate) in the prior year,predominantly related to an

increase in real estate charge-offs.The allowance for loan losses

increased $1.1 billion,which primarily reflected the impact of the

Washington Mutual transaction.Nonperforming assets were $1.1 bil-

lion,an increase of $1.0 billion compared with the prior year,pre-

dominantly reflecting the Washington Mutual transaction and higher

real estate-related balances.
Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion,a decrease of $12 million,or
1%,from the prior year,due to lower performance-based incentive

compensation and volume-based charges from service providers,pre-

dominantly offset by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.
2007 compared with 2006 
Net income was $1.1 billion,an increase of $124 million,or 12%,

from the prior year due primarily to growth in total net revenue,par-

tially offset by higher provision for credit losses.
Record total net revenue of $4.1 billion increased $303 million,or
8%.Net interest income of $2.8 billion increased $113 million,or

4%,driven by double-digit growth in liability balances and loans,

which reflected organic growth and the Bank of New York transac-

tion,largely offset by the continued shift to narrower-spread liability

products and spread compression in the loan and liability portfolios.

Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion,up $190 million,or 18%,due

to increased deposit-related fees,higher investment banking revenue,

and gains on sales of securities acquired in the satisfaction of debt.On a segment basis,Middle Market Banking revenue was $2.7 bil-
lion,an increase of $154 million,or 6%,primarily due to the Bank of

New York transaction,higher deposit-related fees and growth in

investment banking revenue.Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was

(a)TSS is charged a credit reimbursement related to certain exposures managed within
IB credit portfolio on behalf of clients shared with TSS.Beginning in first quarter

2009,income statement and balance sheet items for credit portfolio activity related

to joint IB/TSS clients will be reflected proportionally in the respective IB and TSS

financials.This will replace the previous approach whereby a credit reimbursement

was charged to TSS by IB.
(b)Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net
revenue,which is a measure of pretax performance and another basis by which

management evaluates its performance and that of its competitors.
(c)Loan balances include wholesale overdrafts,commercial card and trade finance loans.

(d)Liability balances include deposits and deposits swept to on-balance sheet liabilities
such as commercial paper,federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold

under repurchase agreements.
2008 compared with 2007 
Net income was a record $1.8 billion,an increase of $370 million,or

26%,from the prior year,driven by higher total net revenue.This

increase was largely offset by higher noninterest expense.
Total net revenue was a record $8.1 billion,an increase of $1.2 bil-
lion,or 17%,from the prior year.Worldwide Securities Services post-

ed record net revenue of $4.6 billion,an increase of $647 million,or

16%,from the prior year.The growth was driven by wider spreads in

securities lending,foreign exchange and liability products,increased

product usage by new and existing clients (largely in custody,fund

services,alternative investment services and depositary receipts) and

higher liability balances,reflecting increased client deposit activity

resulting from recent market conditions.These benefits were offset

partially by market depreciation.Treasury Services posted record net

revenue of $3.6 billion,an increase of $542 million,or 18%,reflect-

ing higher liability balances and volume growth in electronic funds
transfer products and trade loans.Revenue growth from higher liabil-

ity balances reflects increased client deposit activity resulting from
recent market conditions as well as organic growth.TSS firmwide net

revenue,which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in

other lines of business,grew to $11.1 billion,an increase of $1.5 bil-

lion,or 16%.Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $6.5

billion,an increase of $869 million,or 15%.
Noninterest expense was $5.2 billion,an increase of $643 million,or
14%,from the prior year,reflecting higher expense related to busi-

ness and volume growth as well as continued investment in new
product platforms.
2007 compared with 2006 
Net income was a record $1.4 billion,an increase of $307 million,or

28%,from the prior year,driven by record total net revenue,partially

by increased product usage by new and existing clients (primarily cus-
tody,securities lending,depositary receipts and fund services),market

appreciation on assets under custody,and wider spreads on securities

lending.These gains were offset partially by spread compression on

liability products.Treasury Services net revenue was $3.0 billion,an

increase of $221 million,or 8%,from the prior year.The results were

driven by growth in electronic transaction volumes and higher liability

balances,offset partially by a shift to narrower-spread liability prod-

ucts.TSS firmwide net revenue,which includes Treasury Services net

revenue recorded in other lines of business,grew to $9.6 billion,up

$1.0 billion,or 12%.Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to

$5.6 billion,up $391 million,or 7%.
Noninterest expense was $4.6 billion,an increase of $314 million,or
7%,from the prior year,reflecting higher expense related to business

and volume growth,as well as investment in new product platforms.

2008 compared with 2007 
Net income was $1.4 billion,a decline of $609 million,or 31%,from

the prior year,driven by lower total net revenue offset partially by

lower noninterest expense.
Total net revenue was $7.6 billion,a decrease of $1.1 billion,or
12%,from the prior year.Noninterest revenue was $6.1 billion,a

decline of $1.4 billion,or 19%,due to lower performance fees and

the effect of lower markets,including the impact of lower market val-

uations of seed capital investments.The lower results were offset

partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger and increased rev-
enue from net asset inflows.Net interest income was $1.5 billion,up

$358 million,or 31%,from the prior year,due to higher deposit and

loan balances and wider deposit spreads.
Private Bank revenue grew 9% to $2.6 billion,due to increased
deposit and loan balances and net asset inflows,partially offset by

the effect of lower markets and lower performance fees.Institutional

revenue declined 30% to $1.8 billion due to lower performance fees,

partially offset by net liquidity inflows.Retail revenue declined 33%

to $1.6 billion due to the effect of lower markets,including the

impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments and

net equity outflows.Private Wealth Management revenue grew 4%

to $1.4 billion due to higher deposit and loan balances.Bear Stearns

Brokerage contributed $237 million to revenue.
The provision for credit losses was $85 million,compared with a ben-
efit of $18 million in the prior year,reflecting an increase in loan bal-

ances,higher net charge-offs and a weakening credit environment.
Noninterest expense was $5.3 billion,down $217 million,or 4%,com-
pared with the prior year due to lower performance-based compensa-
tion,largely offset by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and higher

compensation expense resulting from increased average headcount.
2007 compared with 2006 
Net income was a record $2.0 billion,an increase of $557 million,or

40%,from the prior year.Results benefited from record total net rev-

enue,partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Total net revenue was $8.6 billion,an increase of $1.8 billion,or
27%,from the prior year.Noninterest revenue,primarily fees and

commissions,was $7.5 billion,up $1.7 billion,or 29%,largely due

to increased assets under management and higher performance and
placement fees.Net interest income was $1.2 billion,up $189 mil-

lion,or 19%,from the prior year,largely due to higher deposit and

loan balances.
Institutional revenue grew 28% to $2.5 billion,due to net asset
inflows and performance fees.Private Bank revenue grew 40% to

$2.4 billion,due to higher assets under management,performance

and placement fees,and increased loan and deposit balances.Retail

revenue grew 28%,to $2.4 billion,primarily due to market apprecia-

tion and net asset inflows.Private Wealth Management revenue

grew 8% to $1.3 billion,reflecting higher assets under management

and higher deposit balances.

$76 billion,or 5%,from the prior year.Assets under management

(ﬁAUMﬂ) were $1.1 trillion,down $60 billion,or 5%,from the prior

year.The decrease was due to the effect of lower markets and non-

liquidity outflows,predominantly offset by liquidity product inflows

across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets under
management.Custody,brokerage,administration and deposit bal-

ances were $363 billion,down $16 billion due to the effect of lower

markets on brokerage and custody balances,offset by the addition of

Mutual net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price,which resulted in negative

goodwill.In accordance with SFAS 141,nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-

sale were written down against that negative goodwill.The negative goodwill that

remained after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary

gain in 2008.(j)In November 2008,the Firm transferred $5.8 billion of higher quality credit card
loans from the legacy Chase portfolio to a securitization trust previously established
by Washington Mutual (ﬁthe Trustﬂ).As a result of converting higher credit quality

Chase-originated on-book receivables to the Trust's seller's interest which has a

higher overall loss rate reflective of the total assets within the Trust,approximately

$400 million of incremental provision expense was recorded during the fourth quar-

ter.This incremental provision expense was recorded in the Corporate segment as

the action related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations.For

further discussion of credit card securitizations,see Note 16 on page 182 of this

Annual Report.(k)Includes $9 million for credit card securitizations related to the Washington Mutual

Net income was $1.9 billion,compared with $842 million in the prior

year,benefiting from strong Private Equity gains,partially offset by

tinued operations of $795 million,which included a one-time gain of

$622 million from the sale of selected corporate trust businesses.
Net income for Private Equity was $2.2 billion,compared with $627
million in the prior year.Total net revenue was $4.0 billion,an

increase of $2.8 billion.The increase was driven by Private Equity

gains of $4.1 billion,compared with $1.3 billion,reflecting a higher

level of gains and the change in classification of carried interest to
compensation expense.Total noninterest expense was $589 million,

an increase of $422 million from the prior year.The increase was

driven by higher compensation expense,reflecting the change in the

classification of carried interest.
Net loss for Corporate was $150 million,compared with a net loss of
$391 million in the prior year.Corporate total net revenue was $452

million,an increase of $1.6 billion.Revenue benefited from net security

gains compared with net security losses in the prior year and improved
net interest spread.Total noninterest expense was $959 million,an

increase of $284 million from the prior year.The increase reflected high-

er net litigation expense,driven by credit card-related litigation and the

absence of prior-year insurance recoveries related to certain material liti-

gation,partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Net loss for merger costs related to the Bank One and the Bank ofNew York transactions were $130 million,compared with a loss of

$189 million in the prior year.Merger costs were $209 million,com-

pared with $305 million in the prior year.

75Private equity portfolio2008 compared with 2007 
The carrying value of the private equity portfolio at December 31,

2008,was $6.9 billion,down from $7.2 billion at December 31,

2007.The portfolio decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable valu-

ation adjustments on existing investments,partially offset by new

investments,and the addition of the Bear Stearns portfolios.The port-

folio represented 5.8% of the Firm™s stockholders™ equity less good-

will at December 31,2008,down from 9.2% at December 31,2007.
2007 compared with 2006
The carrying value of the private equity portfolio at December 31,

2007,was $7.2 billion,up from $6.1 billion at December 31,2006.

The portfolio increase was due primarily to favorable valuation

adjustments on nonpublic investments and new investments,partially

offset by sales activity.The portfolio represented 9.2% of the Firm™s

stockholders™ equity less goodwill at December 31,2007,up from

8.6% at December 31,2006.

Consolidated Balance Sheets overviewThe following is a discussion of the significant changes in the

Consolidated Balance Sheets from December 31,2007.
Deposits with banks;federal funds sold and securities pur-
chased under resale agreements;securities borrowed;fed-

eral funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under

repurchase agreements

The Firm utilizes deposits with banks,federal funds sold and securi-

ties purchased under resale agreements,securities borrowed,and

federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repur-

chase agreements as part of its liquidity management activities to
manage the Firm™s cash positions and risk-based capital require-

ments and to support the Firm™s trading and risk management activi-

ties.In particular,the Firm uses securities purchased under resale

agreements and securities borrowed to provide funding or liquidity
to clients by purchasing and borrowing clients™ securities for the
short-term.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements are used as short-term funding sources

for the Firm and to make securities available to clients for their short-

term purposes.The increase from December 31,2007,in deposits

with banks reflected a higher level of interbank lending;a reclassifi-

cation of deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank from cash and due

from banks to deposits with banks reflecting a policy change of the
Federal Reserve Bank to pay interest to depository institutions on

reserve balances,and assets acquired as a result of the Bear Stearns

merger.The increase in securities borrowed and securities purchased

under resale agreements was related to assets acquired as a result of

the Bear Stearns merger and growth in demand from clients for liq-
uidity.The increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements

reflected higher short-term funding requirements to fulfill clients™

demand for liquidity and finance the Firm™s AFS securities inventory,

and the effect of the liabilities assumed in connection with the Bear
Stearns merger.For additional information on the Firm™s Liquidity

Risk Management,see pages 88Œ92 of this Annual Report.
Trading assets and liabilities Œ debt and equity instruments
The Firm uses debt and equity trading instruments for both market-

making and proprietary risk-taking activities.These instruments con-

sist predominantly of fixed income securities,including government

and corporate debt;equity,including convertible securities;loans,

including certain prime mortgage and other loans warehoused by

RFS and IB for sale or securitization purposes and accounted for at
fair value under SFAS 159;and physical commodities inventories.The

decreases in trading assets and liabilities Œ debt and equity instru-

ments from December 31,2007,reflected the effect of the challeng-

ing capital markets environment,particularly for debt securities,par-

tially offset by positions acquired as a result of the Bear Stearns
merger.For additional information,refer to Note 4 and Note 6 on

pages 141Œ155 and 158Œ160,respectively,of this Annual Report.
Trading assets and liabilities Œ derivative receivables and
payables
Derivative instruments enable end-users to increase,reduce or alter

exposure to credit or market risks.The value of a derivative is derived

from its reference to an underlying variable or combination of variables

such as interest rate,credit,foreign exchange,equity or commodity

prices or indices.JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for

customers,is an end-user of derivatives for its principal risk-taking

activities,and is also an end-user of derivatives to hedge or manage

risks of market and credit exposures,modify the interest rate character-

istics of related balance sheet instruments or meet longer-term invest-

ment objectives.The majority of the Firm™s derivatives are entered into

for market-making purposes.The increase in derivative receivables and

payables from December 31,2007,was primarily related to the decline

in interest rates,widening credit spreads and volatile foreign exchange

rates reflected in interest rate,credit and foreign exchange derivatives,

respectively.The increase also included positions acquired in the Bear

Stearns merger.For additional information,refer to derivative contracts,

Note 4,Note 6 and Note 32 on pages 141Œ155,158Œ160,and

214Œ217,respectively,of this Annual Report.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
77SecuritiesAlmost all of the Firm™s securities portfolio is classified as AFS and is

used predominantly to manage the Firm™s exposure to interest rate

movements,as well as to make strategic longer-term investments.

The AFS portfolio increased from December 31,2007,predominantly

as a result of purchases,partially offset by sales and maturities.For

additional information related to securities,refer to the Corporate/Private

Equity segment discussion,Note 4 and Note 12 on pages 73Œ75,

141Œ155 and 170Œ174,respectively,of this Annual Report.
Loans and allowance for loan lossesThe Firm provides loans to a variety of customers,from large corpo-

rate and institutional clients to individual consumers.Loans increased

from December 31,2007,largely due to loans acquired in the

Washington Mutual transaction,organic growth in lending in the

wholesale businesses,particularly CB,and growth in the consumer

prime mortgage portfolio driven by the decision to retain,rather than

sell,new originations of nonconforming mortgage loans.
Both the consumer and wholesale components of the allowance for
loan losses increased from the prior year reflecting the addition of

noncredit-impaired loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transac-

tion,including an increase to conform the allowance applicable to

assets acquired from Washington Mutual to the Firm™s loan loss

methodologies.Excluding the Washington Mutual transaction the con-

sumer allowance rose due to an increase in estimated losses for home

equity,subprime mortgage,prime mortgage and credit card loans due

to the effects of continued housing price declines,rising unemploy-

ment and a weakening economic environment.Excluding the

Washington Mutual transaction,the increase in the wholesale

allowance was due to the impact of the transfer of $4.9 billion of

funded and unfunded leveraged lending loans in IB to the retained

loan portfolio from the held-for-sale loan portfolio,the effect of a

weakening credit environment and loan growth.For a more detailed

discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses,

refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 92Œ111,and Notes 4,5,

14 and 15 on pages 141Œ155,156Œ158,175Œ178 and 178Œ180,

respectively,of this Annual Report.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable;accounts payable
and other liabilities
The Firm™s accrued interest and accounts receivable consist of accrued

interest receivable from interest-earning assets;receivables from cus-

tomers (primarily from activities related to IB™s Prime Services busi-

ness);receivables from brokers,dealers and clearing organizations;

and receivables from failed securities sales.The Firm™s accounts

payable and other liabilities consist of accounts payable to customers

(primarily from activities related to IB™s Prime Services business),

payables to brokers,dealers and clearing organizations;payables from

failed securities purchases;accrued expense,including for interest-

bearing liabilities;and all other liabilities,including obligations to

return securities received as collateral.The increase in accrued interest

and accounts receivable from December 31,2007,was due largely to

the Bear Stearns merger,reflecting higher customer receivables in IB™s

Prime Services business and the Washington Mutual transaction.The
increase in accounts payable and other liabi
lities was p
redominantlydue to the Bear Stearns merger,reflecting higher customer payables

(primarily related to IB™s Prime Services business),as well as higher

obligations to return securities received as collateral
.For additional
information,see Note 22 on page 202 of this Annual Report.
GoodwillGoodwill arises from business combinations and represents the

excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value

amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.The

increase in goodwill was due predominantly to the dissolution of

Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture,the merger with Bear

Stearns,the purchase of an additional equity interest in Highbridge

and tax-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the
Bank One merger,which increased goodwill attributed to IB.These

items were offset partially by a decrease in goodwill attributed to TSS

predominantly resulting from the sale of a previously consolidated

subsidiary.For additional information,see Note 18 on pages

198Œ201 of this Annual Report.
Other intangible assetsThe Firm™s other intangible assets consist of MSRs,purchased credit

card relationships,other credit card-related intangibles,core deposit

intangibles,and other intangibles.MSRs increased due to the

Washington Mutual transaction and the Bear Stearns merger;sales

in RFS of originated loans;and purchases of MSRs.These increases in

MSRs were partially offset by markdowns of the fair value of the

MSR asset due to changes to inputs and assumptions in the MSR
valuation model,including updates to prepayment assumptions to

reflect current expectations,and to servicing portfolio run-offs.The

decrease in other intangible assets reflects amortization expense

associated with credit card-related and core deposit intangibles,par-

tially offset by increases due to the dissolution of the Chase
Paymentech Solutions joint venture,the purchase of an additional

equity interest in Highbridge,and the acquisition of an institutional

global custody portfolio.For additional information on MSRs and

other intangible assets,see Note 18 on pages 198Œ201 of this

Annual Report.Other assetsThe Firm™s other assets consist of private equity and other invest-

ments,collateral received,corporate and bank-owned life insurance

policies,premises and equipment,assets acquired in loan satisfaction

(including real estate owned),and all other assets.The increase in

other assets from December 31,2007,was due to the Bear Stearns

merger,which partly resulted in a higher volume of collateral received

from customers,the Washington Mutual transaction,and the pur-

chase of asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual

funds in connection with the Federal Reserve™s Asset-Backed

Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility

(ﬁAML Facilityﬂ),which was established by the Federal Reserve on

September 19,2008,as a temporary lending facility to provide liquidity

to eligible U.S.money market mutual funds.For additional information

regarding the AML Facility,see Executive Overview and Note 21 on

pages 41Œ44 and 202 respectively,of this Annual Report.
Management’s discussion and analysis
78JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
DepositsThe Firm™s deposits represent a liability to customers,both retail and

wholesale,related to non-brokerage funds held on their behalf.

Deposits are generally classified by location (U.S.and non-U.S.),

whether they are interest or noninterest-bearing,and by type (i.e.,

demand,money market deposit,savings,time or negotiable order of

withdrawal accounts).Deposits help provide a stable and consistent

source of funding for the Firm.Deposits were at a higher level com-

pared with the level at December 31,2007,predominantly from the

deposits assumed in the Washington Mutual transaction,net increas-

es in wholesale interest- and noninterest-bearing deposits in TSS,AM

and CB.The increase in TSS was driven by both new and existing

clients,and due to the deposit inflows related to the heightened

volatility and credit concerns affecting the markets.For more infor-

mation on deposits,refer to the TSS and RFS segment discussions on

pages 68Œ69 and 57Œ62,respectively,and the Liquidity Risk

Management discussion on pages 88Œ92 of this Annual Report.For

more information on wholesale liability balances,including deposits,

refer to the CB and TSS segment discussions on pages 66Œ67 and

68Œ69 of this Annual Report.
Commercial paper and other borrowed funds
The Firm utilizes commercial paper and other borrowed funds as part

of its liquidity management activities to meet short-term funding

needs,and in connection with a TSS liquidity management product

whereby excess client funds,are transferred into commercial paper

overnight sweep accounts.The increase in other borrowed funds was

predominantly due to advances from Federal Home Loan Banks of

$70.2 billion (net of maturities of $10.4 billion) that were assumed
as part of the Washington Mutual transaction and nonrecourse

advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (ﬁFRBBﬂ) to fund

purchases of asset-backed commercial paper from money market

mutual funds,and other borrowings from the Federal Reserve under

the Term Auction Facility program.For additional information on the

Firm™s Liquidity Risk Management and other borrowed funds,see

pages 88Œ92 and Note 21 on page 202 of this Annual Report.
Long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt securities
The Firm utilizes long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt

securities to provide cost-effective and diversified sources of funds

and as critical components of the Firm™s liquidity and capital man-

agement.Long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt securities

increased from December 31,2007,predominantly due to debt

assumed in both the Bear Stearns merger and the Washington

Mutual transaction,and debt issuances of $20.8 billion,which are

guaranteed by the FDIC under its TLG Program.These increases were

partially offset by net maturities and redemptions,including IB struc-

tured notes,the issuances of which are generally client-driven.For

additional information on the Firm™s long-term debt activities,see the

Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 88Œ92 and Note 23
on pages 203Œ204 of this Annual Report.
Stockholders™ equity
The increase in total stockholders™ equity from December 31,2007,

was predominantly due to the issuance of preferred and common 

equity securities during 2008.In the fourth quarter of 2008,JPMorgan

Chase participated in the Capital Purchase Program and issued pre-

ferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock to the U.S.

Treasury,resulting in a $25.0 billion increase to stockholders™ equity.

Additional preferred stock issuances and a common stock issuance
during 2008 increased equity by $19.3 billion.Equity from issuances of

stock awards under the Firm™s employee stock-based compensation

plans,the Bear Stearns merger,and net income for 2008 was more

than offset by the declaration of cash dividends and net losses recorded

within accumulated other comprehensive income related to AFS securi-

ties and defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee
benefit plans.For a further discussion,see the Capital Management

section that follows,and Note 24 and Note 27 on pages 205Œ206 

and 208,respectively,of this Annual Report.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
79in the SPE in order to provide liquidity.These commitments are
included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit and asset
purchase agreements,as shown in the Off-balance sheet lending-

related financial instruments and guarantees table on page 81 of

this Annual Report.
As noted above,the Firm is involved with three types of SPEs.A sum-
mary of each type of SPE follows.
Multi-seller conduitsThe Firm helps customers meet their financing needs by providing

access to the commercial paper markets through variable interest

entities (ﬁVIEsﬂ) known as multi-seller conduits.Multi-seller conduit

entities are separate bankruptcy-remote entities that purchase inter-

ests in,and make loans secured by,pools of receivables and other

financial assets pursuant to agreements with customers of the Firm.
The conduits fund their purchases and loans through the issuance of

highly rated commercial paper to third-party investors.The primary

source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flow from
the pools of assets.JPMorgan Chase receives fees related to the

structuring of multi-seller conduit transactions and receives compen-

sation from the multi-seller conduits for its role as administrative

agent,liquidity provider,and provider of program-wide credit

enhancement.Investor intermediation
As a financial intermediary,the Firm creates certain types of VIEs and

also structures transactions,typically derivative structures,with these

VIEs to meet investor needs.The Firm may also provide liquidity and

other support.The risks inherent in derivative instruments or liquidity

commitments are managed similarly to other credit,market and liquidi-

ty risks to which the Firm is exposed.The principal types of VIEs the

Firm uses in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles,

credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles.
Loan securitizations
JPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety of loans,including

residential mortgages,credit cards,automobile,student,and com-

mercial loans (primarily related to real estate).JPMorgan Chase-

sponsored securitizations utilize SPEs as part of the securitization
process.These SPEs are structured to meet the definition of a QSPE

(as discussed in Note 1 on page 134 of this Annual Report);accord-

ingly,the assets and liabilities of securitization-related QSPEs are not

reflected on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets (except for

retained interests,as described below).The primary purpose of these

vehicles is to meet investor needs and generate liquidity for the Firm

through the sale of loans to the QSPEs.These QSPEs are financed

through the issuance of fixed or floating-rate asset-backed securities

that are sold to third-party investors or held by the Firm.Consolidation and consolidation sensitivity analysis on capitalFor more information regarding these programs and the Firm™s other

SPEs,as well as the Firm™s consolidation analysis for these programs,

see Note 16 and Note 17 on pages 180Œ188 and 189Œ198,respec-

tively,of this Annual Report.
JPMorgan Chase is involved with several types of off-balance sheet
arrangements,including special purpose entities (ﬁSPEsﬂ) and lend-

ing-related financial instruments (e.g.,commitments and guarantees).
Special-purpose entitiesThe basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE.

The SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to

investors in the form of commercial paper,short-term asset-backed

notes,medium-term notes and other forms of interest.SPEs are gen-

erally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE™s assets

by creditors of other entities,including the creditors of the seller of

the assets.
SPEs are an important part of the financial markets,providing market
liquidity by facilitating investors™ access to specific portfolios of
assets and risks.These arrangements are integral to the markets for

mortgage-backed securities,commercial paper and other asset-

backed securities.
JPMorgan Chase uses SPEs as a source of liquidity for itself and itsclients by securitizing financial assets,and by creating investment

products for clients.The Firm is involved with SPEs through multi-

seller conduits and investor intermediation activities,and as a result

of its loan securitizations,through qualifying special purpose entities

(ﬁQSPEsﬂ).This discussion focuses mostly on multi-seller conduits

and investor intermediation.For a detailed discussion of all SPEs with

which the Firm is involved,and the related accounting,see Note 1,

Note 16 and Note 17 on pages 134Œ145,180Œ188 and 189Œ198,

respectively of this Annual Report.
The Firm holds capital,as deemed appropriate,against all SPE-relat-
ed transactions and related exposures,such as derivative transactions

and lending-related commitments and guarantees.
The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any
SPE transaction,and its policies require that transactions with SPEs

be conducted at arm™s length and reflect market pricing.Consistent

with this policy,no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest

in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment
would violate the Firm™s Code of Conduct.These rules prohibit

employees from self-dealing and acting on behalf of the Firm in
transactions with which they or their family have any significant

financial interest.
Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs,the Firm could be required

to provide funding if the short-term credit rating of JPMorgan Chase

Bank,N.A.,was downgraded below specific levels,primarily ﬁP-1ﬂ,

ﬁA-1ﬂand ﬁF1ﬂfor Moody™s,Standard & Poor™s and Fitch,respec-

tively.The amount of these liquidity commitments was $61.0 billion

and $94.0 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.

Alternatively,if JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,were downgraded,the

Firm could be replaced by another liquidity provider in lieu of provid-
ing funding under the liquidity commitment,or in certain circum-

stances,the Firm could facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets

income (i.e.,for income from acting as administrator,structurer,liq-

uidity provider).It does not include mark-to-market gains and losses

from changes in the fair value of trading positions (such as derivative

transactions) entered into with VIEs.Those gains and losses are

mortgage loans modifications
In December 2007,the American Securitization Forum (ﬁASFﬂ) issued

the ﬁStreamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for

Securitized Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loansﬂ(ﬁthe

Frameworkﬂ).The Framework provides guidance for servicers to

streamline evaluation procedures of borrowers with certain subprime

adjustable rate mortgage (ﬁARMﬂ) loans to more efficiently provide

modification of such loans with terms that are more appropriate for
the individual needs of such borrowers.The Framework applies to all

first-lien subprime ARM loans that have a fixed rate of interest for an

initial period of 36 months or less;are included in securitized pools;

were originated between January 1,2005,and July 31,2007;and

have an initial interest rate reset date between January 1,2008,and

July 31,2010.The Framework categorizes the population of ASF

Framework Loans into three segments.Segment 1 includes loans

where the borrower is current and likely to be able to refinance into

any available mortgage product.Segment 2 includes loans where the

borrower is current,unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily

available mortgage industry product and meets certain defined crite-

ria.Segment 3 includes loans where the borrower is not current,as

defined,and does not meet the criteria for Segments 1 or 2.

JPMorgan Chase adopted the Framework during the first quarter of

2008.For those AFS Framework Loans serviced by the Firm and

owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs,the Firm modified principal amounts

of $1.7 billion of Segment 2 subprime mortgages during the year
ended December 31,2008.The following table presents selected

information relating to the principal amount of Segment 3 loans for
the year ended December 31,2008,including those that have been

modified,subjected to other loss mitigation activities or have been

prepaid by the borrower.

Off-balance sheet lending-related financial
instruments and guarantees
JPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments (e.g.,
commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its

customers.The contractual amount of these financial instruments

represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty

draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obli-

gation under the guarantee,and the counterparty subsequently fail

to perform according to the terms of the contract.These commit-

ments and guarantees historically expire without being drawn and

even higher proportions expire without a default.As a result,the

total contractual amount of these instruments is not,in the Firm™s

view,representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding

requirements.Further,certain commitments,primarily related to con-

sumer financings,are cancelable,upon notice,at the option of the

Firm.For further discussion of lending-related commitments and

guarantees and the Firm™s accounting for them,see lending-related

commitments in Credit Risk Management on page 102 and Note 33
on pages 218Œ222 of this Annual Report.
Contractual cash obligations
In the normal course of business,the Firm enters into various con-

tractual obligations that may require future cash payments.

Commitments for future cash expenditures primarily include contracts

to purchase future services and capital expenditures related to real
estateŒrelated obligations and equipment.The accompanying table summarizes,by remaining maturity,
JPMorgan Chase™s off-balance sheet lending-related financial instru-

ments and significant contractual cash obligations at December 31,

2008.Contractual purchases and capital expenditures in the table

below reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally

enforceable contracts with terms that are both fixed and deter-

minable.Excluded from the following table are a number of obliga-

tions to be settled in cash,primarily in under one year.These obliga-

tions are reflected on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets and

include federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under

repurchase agreements;commercial paper;other borrowed funds;

purchases of debt and equity instruments;derivative payables;and

certain purchases of instruments that resulted in settlement failures.

Also excluded are contingent payments associated with certain
acquisitions that could not be estimated.For discussion regarding

long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt securities,see Note

23 on pages 203Œ204 of this Annual Report.For discussion regard-

Economic risk capitalJPMorgan Chase assesses its capital adequacy relative to the risksunderlying the Firm™s business activities,utilizing internal risk-assess-

ment methodologies.The Firm assigns economic capital primarily

based upon four risk factors:credit risk,market risk,operational risk

and private equity risk.In 2008,the growth in economic risk capital

was driven by higher credit risk capital,which was increased primarily

due to a combination of higher derivative exposure,a weakening

credit environment,and asset growth related to the Bear Stearns and

Washington Mutual transactions.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Firm™s capital management framework is intended to ensure that
there is capital sufficient to support the underlying risks of the Firm™s

business activities and to maintain ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂstatus under

regulatory requirements.In addition,the Firm holds capital above

these requirements in amounts deemed appropriate to achieve the
Firm™s regulatory and debt rating objectives.The process of assigning

equity to the lines of business is integrated into the Firm™s capital

framework and is overseen by the ALCO.
Line of business equity The Firm™s framework for allocating capital is based upon the follow-

ing objectives:†integrate firmwide capital management activities with capital
management activities within each of the lines of business†measure performance consistently across all lines of business 

†provide comparability with peer firms for each of the lines of
business Equity for a line of business represents the amount the Firm believes
the business would require if it were operating independently,incor-

porating sufficient capital to address economic risk measures,regula-

tory capital requirements and capital levels for similarly rated peers.

Capital is also allocated to each line of business for,among other

things,goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions

effected by the line of business.Return on common equity is meas-

ured and internal targets for expected returns are established as a
key measure of a business segment™s performance.
Relative to 2007,line of business equity increased during 2008,
reflecting growth across the businesses.In addition,at the end of the

third quarter of 2008,equity was increased for each line of business

in anticipation of the future implementation of the new Basel II capi-
tal rules.For further details on these rules,see Basel II on page 84 of

this Annual Report.Finally,during 2008,capital allocated to RFS,CS,

and CB was increased as a result of the Washington Mutual transac-

tion;capital allocated to AM was increased due to the Bear Stearns

merger and the purchase of the additional equity interest in
Highbridge;and capital allocated to IB was increased due to the

Bear Stearns merger.
In accordance with SFAS 142,the lines of business perform the
required goodwill impairment testing.For a further discussion of

goodwill and impairment testing,see Critical Accounting Estimates

Used by the Firm and Note 18 on pages 119Œ123 and 198Œ201,
respectively,of this Annual Report.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
83Credit risk capital 
Credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business-

es (IB,CB,TSS and AM) and consumer businesses (RFS and CS).
Credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined
in terms of unexpected credit losses,both from defaults and declines

in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration,measured over a

one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an ﬁAAﬂcredit

rating standard.Unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for

which provisions for credit losses are maintained.The capital

methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk:

exposure at default (or loan-equivalent amount),default likelihood,

credit spreads,loss severity and portfolio correlation.
Credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon productand other relevant risk segmentation.Actual segment level default

and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a
one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an ﬁAAﬂcredit

rating standard.Statistical results for certain segments or portfolios

are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench-
marks,such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital

held at representative monoline competitors,where appropriate.
Market risk capital
The Firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that

capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and

financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari-

ables,such as interest and foreign exchange rates,credit spreads,

securities prices and commodities prices.Daily Value-at-Risk (ﬁVaRﬂ),

biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine

appropriate capital levels.The Firm allocates market risk capital to

each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg-
ment™s VaR and stress-test exposures.See Market Risk Management

on pages 111Œ116 of this Annual Report for more information about

these market risk measures.
Operational risk capital
Capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using

a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera-

tional risk on a bottom-up basis.The operational risk capital model is

based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses,

with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the
quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod-

ucts.The Firm believes its model is consistent with the new Basel II

Framework.
Private equity risk capital
Capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities,third-party

fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to

cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets

and related asset devaluations.In addition to negative market fluctua-

tions,potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be

magnified by liquidity risk.The capital allocation for the private equity

portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered

by the Firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of

adverse equity market conditions.
Regulatory capital The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ﬁFederal

Reserveﬂ) establishes capital requirements,including well-capitalized

standards for the consolidated financial holding company.The Office

of the Comptroller of the Currency (ﬁOCCﬂ) establishes similar capital
requirements and standards for the Firm™s national banks,including

JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,and Chase Bank USA,N.A.
The Federal Reserve granted the Firm,for a period of 18 months fol-
lowing the Bear Stearns merger,relief up to a certain specified

amount and subject to certain conditions from the Federal Reserve™s

risk-based capital and leverage requirements with respect to Bear

Stearns™ risk-weighted assets and other exposures acquired.The

amount of such relief is subject to reduction by one-sixth each quarter
subsequent to the merger and expires on October 1,2009.The OCC

granted JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.similar relief from its risk-based

capital and leverage requirements.
JPMorgan Chase maintained a well-capitalized position,based upon
Tier 1 and Total capital ratios at December 31,2008 and 2007,as

indicated in the tables below.For more information,see Note 30 on

pages 212Œ213 of this Annual Report.

on the provisions of the current proposal and the Firm™s interpretation of the propos-

al,the Firm estimates that the impact of consolidation could be up to $70 billion of

credit card receivables,$40 billion of assets related to Firm-sponsored multi-seller

conduits,and $50 billion of other loans (including residential mortgages);the

decrease in the Tier 1 capital ratio could be approximately 80 basis points.The ulti-

mate impact could differ significantly due to the FASB™s continuing deliberations on

the final requirements of the rule and market conditions.

Capital Purchase Program
Pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program,on October 28,2008,the

Firm issued to the U.S.Treasury,for total proceeds of $25.0 billion,(i)

2.5 million shares of Series K Preferred Stock,and (ii) a warrant to pur-

chase up to 88,401,697 shares of the Firm™s common stock,at an exer-

cise price of $42.42 per share,subject to certain antidilution and other

adjustments.The Series K Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital.
The Series K Preferred Stock bears cumulative dividends at a rate of
5% per year for the first five years and 9% per year thereafter.The

Series K Preferred Stock ranks equally with the Firm™s existing 6.15%

Cumulative Preferred Stock,Series E;5.72% Cumulative Preferred

Stock,Series F;5.49% Cumulative Preferred Stock,Series G;Fixed-

to-Floating Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,Series I;

and 8.63% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,Series J,in

terms of dividend payments and upon liquidation of the Firm.Any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series K Preferred Stockmust be fully paid before dividends may be declared or paid on stock
ranking junior or equally with the Series K Preferred Stock.Pursuant

to the Capital Purchase Program,until October 28,2011,the U.S.

Treasury™s consent is required for any increase in dividends on the

Firm™s common stock from the amount of the last quarterly stock div-

idend declared by the Firm prior to October 14,2008,unless the
Series K Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole before then,or the
U.S.Treasury has transferred all of the Series K Preferred Stock it

owns to third parties.
The Firm may not repurchase or redeem any common stock or other
equity securities of the Firm,or any trust preferred securities issued

by the Firm or any of its affiliates,without the prior consent of the

U.S.Treasury (other than (i) repurchases of the Series K Preferred

Stock and (ii) repurchases of junior preferred shares or common
stock in connection with any employee benefit plan in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice).
Basel II  
The minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S.

federal banking agencies follow the Capital Accord of the Basel

Committee on Banking Supervision.In 2004,the Basel Committee

published a revision to the Accord (ﬁBasel IIﬂ).The goal of the new

Basel II Framework is to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital

calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices

among large,internationally active banking organizations.U.S.bank-

ing regulators published a final Basel II rule in December 2007,which

will require JPMorgan Chase to implement Basel II at the holding
company level,as well as at certain of its key U.S.bank subsidiaries.
Prior to full implementation of the new Basel II Framework,
JPMorgan Chase will be required to complete a qualification period
of four consecutive quarters during which it will need to demonstrate

that it meets the requirements of the new rule to the satisfaction of
its primary U.S.banking regulators.The U.S.implementation

timetable consists of the qualification period,starting any time

between April 1,2008,and April 1,2010,followed by a minimum

transition period of three years.During the transition period,Basel II

risk-based capital requirements cannot fall below certain floors

based on current (ﬁBasel lﬂ) regulations.JPMorgan Chase expects to

be in compliance with all relevant Basel II rules within the estab-

lished timelines.In addition,the Firm has adopted,and will continue

to adopt,based upon various established timelines,Basel II in certain

non-U.S.jurisdictions,as required.
Broker-dealer regulatory capital  
JPMorgan Chase™s principal U.S.broker-dealer subsidiaries are J.P.

Morgan Securities Inc.(ﬁJPMorgan Securitiesﬂ) and J.P.Morgan

Clearing Corp.(formerly known as Bear Stearns Securities Corp.).

JPMorgan Securities and J.P.Morgan Clearing Corp.are each subject to

Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (ﬁNet Capital

Ruleﬂ).JPMorgan Securities and J.P.Morgan Clearing Corp.are also

registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17
under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ﬁCFTCﬂ).
JPMorgan Securities and J.P.Morgan Clearing Corp.have elected to
compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with
the ﬁAlternative Net Capital Requirementﬂof the Net Capital Rule.At

December 31,2008,JPMorgan Securities™ net capital,as defined by

the Net Capital Rule,of $7.2 billion exceeded the minimum require-

ment by $6.6 billion.In addition to its net capital requirements,

JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excessJPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
84www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
85of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the Securities andExchange Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) in the event that tentative net capital is
less than $5.0 billion in accordance with the market and credit risk

standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule.As of December 31,

2008,JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the

minimum and the notification requirements.On October 1,2008,J.P.

Morgan Securities Inc.merged with and into Bear,Stearns & Co.Inc.,

and the surviving entity changed its name to J.P.Morgan Securities Inc.
J.P.Morgan Clearing Corp.,a subsidiary of JPMorgan Securities provides
clearing and settlement services.At December 31,2008,J.P.Morgan

Clearing Corp.™s net capital,as defined by the Net Capital Rule,of $4.7

billion exceeded the minimum requirement by $3.3 billion.DividendsOn February 23,2009,the Board of Directors reduced the Firm's quar-

terly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share,effective

for the dividend payable April 30,2009,to shareholders of record on

April 6,2009.JPMorgan Chase declared quarterly cash dividends on

its common stock in the amount of $0.38 for each quarter of 2008
and the second,third and fourth quarters of 2007,and $0.34 per

share for the first quarter of 2007 and for each quarter of 2006.The Firm™s common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan Chase™s
earnings outlook,desired dividend payout ratios,need to maintain an

adequate capital level and alternative investment opportunities.The

Firm™s ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.For information

regarding such restrictions,see page 84 and Note 24 and Note 29 on

pages 205Œ206 and 211,respectively,of this Annual Report and for

additional information regarding the reduction of the dividend,see

share of $48.60.The Board of Directors approved in April 2007,a stock repurchase
program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the

Firm™s common shares,which superseded an $8.0 billion stock repur-

chase program approved in 2006.The $10.0 billion authorization

includes shares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the
Firm™s employee stock-based plans.The actual number of shares that

may be repurchased is subject to various factors,including market

conditions;legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of

repurchase activity;the Firm™s capital position (taking into account

goodwill and intangibles);internal capital generation;and alternative

potential investment opportunities.The repurchase program does not

include specific price targets or timetables;may be executed through

open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,or utiliz-

ing Rule 10b5-1 programs;and may be suspended at any time.A

Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase shares
during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing com-
mon stock Œ for example,during internal trading ﬁblack-out peri-

ods.ﬂAll purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made accord-

ing to a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not
aware of material nonpublic information.
As of December 31,2008,$6.2 billion of authorized repurchase
capacity remained under the current stock repurchase program.

RISK MANAGEMENT                 
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase™s business activities.The
Firm™s risk management framework and governance structure are

intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing manage-
ment of the major risks inherent in its business activities.The Firm™s

ability to properly identify,measure,monitor and report risk is critical

to both its soundness and profitability.
†Risk identification:The Firm™s exposure to risk through its daily
business dealings,including lending,trading and capital markets

activities,is identified and aggregated through the Firm™s risk

management infrastructure.In addition,individuals who manage

risk positions,particularly those positions that are complex,are

responsible for identifying and estimating potential losses that
could arise from specific or unusual events,that may not be cap-

tured in other models,and those risks are communicated to sen-

ior management.†Risk measurement:The Firm measures risk using a variety of
methodologies,including calculating probable loss,unexpected

loss and value-at-risk,and by conducting stress tests and making

comparisons to external benchmarks.Measurement models and

related assumptions are routinely reviewed with the goal of
ensuring that the Firm™s risk estimates are reasonable and reflect

underlying positions.
†Risk monitoring/control:The Firm™s risk management policies and
procedures incorporate risk mitigation strategies and include

approval limits by customer,product,industry,country and busi-

ness.These limits are monitored on a daily,weekly and monthly

basis,as appropriate.
†Risk reporting:Risk reporting is executed on a line of business
and consolidated basis.This information is reported to manage-

ment on a daily,weekly and monthly basis,as appropriate.There

are eight major risk types identified in the business activities of
the Firm:liquidity risk,credit risk,market risk,interest rate risk,

private equity risk,operational risk,legal and fiduciary risk,and

reputation risk.Risk governance The Firm™s risk governance structure starts with each line of business

being responsible for managing its own risks.Each line of business

works closely with Risk Management through its own risk committee
and,in most cases,its own chief risk officer to manage risk.Each

line of business risk committee is responsible for decisions regarding
the business™ risk strategy,policies and controls.
Overlaying the line of business risk management are four corporate
functions with risk managementŒrelated responsibilities:Treasury,the

Chief Investment Office,Legal and Compliance and Risk

Management.Risk Management is headed by the Firm™s Chief Risk Officer,who is a
member of the Firm™s Operating Committee and who reports to the

Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors,primarily through

the Board™s Risk Policy Committee.Risk Management is responsible

for providing a firmwide function of risk management and controls.

Within Risk Management are units responsible for credit risk,market

risk,operational risk and private equity risk,as well as Risk

Management Services and Risk Technology and Operations.Risk

Management Services is responsible for risk policy and methodology,

risk reporting and risk education;and Risk Technology and

Operations is responsible for building the information technology

infrastructure used to monitor and manage risk.
Treasury and the Chief Investment Office are responsible for measur-
ing,monitoring,reporting and managing the Firm™s liquidity,interest

rate and foreign exchange risk.
Legal and Compliance has oversight for legal and fiduciary risk.
In addition to the risk committees of the lines of business and theabove-referenced corporate functions,the Firm also has an

Investment Committee,ALCO and two other risk-related committees,

namely,the Risk Working Group and the Markets Committee.The

members of these committees are composed of senior management

of the Firm,including representatives of line of business,Risk

Management,Finance and other senior executives.Members of these

risk committees meet frequently to discuss a broad range of topics

including,for example,current market conditions and other external

events,current risk exposures and concentrations to ensure that the

impact of current risk factors are considered broadly across the Firm™s

businesses.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
87The Investment Committee oversees global merger and acquisition
activities undertaken by JPMorgan Chase for its own account that

fall outside the scope of the Firm™s private equity and other principal

finance activities.
The Asset-Liability Committee is responsible for approving the Firm™s
liquidity policy,including contingency funding planning and exposure

to SPEs (and any required liquidity support by the Firm of such SPEs).
The Asset-Liability Committee also oversees the Firm™s capital man-

agement and funds transfer pricing policy (through which lines of

business ﬁtransferﬂinterest and foreign exchange risk to Treasury in

the Corporate/Private Equity segment).
The Risk Working Group meets monthly to review issues such as risk
policy,risk methodology,Basel II and regulatory issues and topics

referred to it by any line of business risk committee.The Markets

Committee,chaired by the Chief Risk Officer,meets at least weekly

to review and determine appropriate courses of action with respect
to significant risk matters,including but not limited to:limits;credit,

market and operational risk;large,high risk transactions;and hedg-

ing strategies.
The Board of Directors exercises its oversight of risk management,
principally through the Board™s Risk Policy Committee and Audit

Committee.The Risk Policy Committee oversees senior management

risk-related responsibilities,including reviewing management policies

and performance against these policies and related benchmarks.The

Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of guidelines and poli-
cies that govern the process by which risk assessment and manage-
ment is undertaken.In addition,the Audit Committee reviews with

management the system of internal controls and financial reporting

that is relied upon to provide reasonable assurance of compliance

with the Firm™s operational risk management processes.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity is crucial to finan-
cial services companies,particularly maintaining appropriate levels of

liquidity during periods of adverse conditions.The Firm™s funding

strategy is to ensure liquidity and diversity of funding sources to

meet actual and contingent liabilities through both stable and
adverse conditions.
JPMorgan Chase uses a centralized approach for liquidity risk man-
agement.Global funding is managed by Corporate Treasury,using

regional expertise as appropriate.Management believes that a cen-

tralized framework maximizes liquidity access,minimizes funding costs

and permits identification and coordination of global liquidity risk.Recent events During the second half of 2008,global markets exhibited extraordi-

nary levels of volatility and increasing signs of stress.Throughout this

period,access by market participants to the debt,equity,and con-

sumer loan securitization markets was constrained and funding

spreads widened sharply.In response to strains in financial markets,

U.S.government and regulatory agencies introduced various programs

to inject liquidity into the financial system.JPMorgan Chase partici-

pated in a number of these programs,two of which were the Capital

Purchase Program and the FDIC™s TLG Program.On October 28,2008,

JPMorgan Chase issued $25.0 billion of preferred stock as well as a
warrant to purchase up to 88,401,697 shares of the Firm™s common

stock to the U.S.Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program,which

enhanced the Firm™s capital and liquidity positions.In addition,on

December 4,2008,JPMorgan Chase elected to continue to partici-

pate in the FDIC™s TLG Program,which facilitated long-term debt

issuances at rates (including the guarantee fee charged by the FDIC)

more favorable than those for non-FDIC guaranteed debt issuances.

Under the TLG Program,the FDIC guarantees certain senior unsecured

debt of JPMorgan Chase,and in return for the guarantees,the FDIC is

paid a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt.Under the

TLG Program,the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and interest on

an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured failure of the

participating entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest

in accordance with the terms of the instrument.During the fourth

quarter of 2008,pursuant to the TLG Program,the Firm issued $20.8

billion of bonds guaranteed by the FDIC,further enhancing the Firm™s

liquidity position.At December 31,2008,all of the FDIC-guaranteed

debt was outstanding and had a carrying value of $21.0 billion,net

of hedges.In the interest of promoting deposit stability,during the

fourth quarter,the FDIC also (i) temporarily increased,through 2009,

insurance coverage on bank deposits to $250,000 per customer from

$100,000 per customer,and (ii) for qualified institutions who partici-

pated in the TLG Program (such as the Firm),provided full deposit

insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.
During the second half of 2008,the Firm™s deposits (excluding those
assumed in connection with the Washington Mutual transaction)

increased substantially,as the Firm benefited from the heightened

volatility and credit concerns affecting the markets.
On May 30,2008,JPMorgan Chase completed the merger with Bear
Stearns.Due to the structure of the transaction and the de-risking of

positions over time,the merger with Bear Stearns had no material

impact on the Firm™s liquidity.On September 25,2008,JPMorgan

Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual from

the FDIC.As part of the Washington Mutual transaction,JPMorgan

Chase assumed Washington Mutual™s deposits as well as its obliga-

tions to its credit card securitization-related master trusts,covered

bonds,and liabilities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks.The

Washington Mutual transaction had an insignificant impact on the

Firm™s overall liquidity position.
Both S&P and Moody™s lowered the Firm™s ratings one notch on
December 19,2008 and January 15,2009,respectively.These rating

actions did not have a material impact on the cost or availability of

funding to the Firm.For a further discussion of credit ratings,see the

Credit Ratings caption of this Liquidity Risk Management section on
pages 91Œ92 of this Annual Report.
Notwithstanding the market events during the latter half of 2008,the
Firm™s liquidity position remained strong based on its liquidity metrics

as of December 31,2008.The Firm believes that its unsecured and

secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet on- and off- balance
sheet obligations.JPMorgan Chase™s long-dated funding,including

core liabilities,exceeded illiquid assets.In addition,during the course

of 2008,the Firm raised funds at the parent holding company in

excess of its minimum threshold to cover its obligations and those of
its nonbank subsidiaries that mature over the next 12 months.
Governance The Asset-Liability Committee approves and oversees the execution

of the Firm™s liquidity policy and contingency funding plan.Corporate

Treasury formulates the Firm™s liquidity and contingency planning

strategies and is responsible for measuring,monitoring,reporting

and managing the Firm™s liquidity risk profile.
Liquidity monitoring The Firm monitors liquidity trends,tracks historical and prospective

on- and off-balance sheet liquidity obligations,identifies and meas-

ures internal and external liquidity warning signals to permit early

detection of liquidity issues,and manages contingency planning

(including identification and testing of various company-specific and

market-driven stress scenarios).Various tools,which together con-

tribute to an overall firmwide liquidity perspective,are used to moni-

tor and manage liquidity.Among others,these include:(i) analysis of

the timing of liquidity sources versus liquidity uses (i.e.,funding

gaps) over periods ranging from overnight to one year;(ii) manage-

ment of debt and capital issuances to ensure that the illiquid portion
of the balance sheet can be funded by equity,long-term debt,trust

preferred capital debt securities and deposits the Firm believes to be

stable;and (iii) assessment of the Firm™s capacity to raise incremental

unsecured and secured funding.www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
89Liquidity of the parent holding company and its nonbank subsidiariesis monitored independently as well as in conjunction with the liquidity
of the Firm™s bank subsidiaries.At the parent holding company level,

long-term funding is managed to ensure that the parent holding
company has,at a minimum,sufficient liquidity to cover its obliga-

tions and those of its nonbank subsidiaries within the next 12
months.For bank subsidiaries,the focus of liquidity risk management

is on maintenance of unsecured and secured funding capacity suffi-
cient to meet on- and off-balance sheet obligations.
A component of liquidity management is the Firm™s contingency
funding plan.The goal of the plan is to ensure appropriate liquidity

during normal and stress periods.The plan considers various tempo-

rary and long-term stress scenarios where access to unsecured fund-

ing is severely limited or nonexistent,taking into account both on-

and off-balance sheet exposures,and separately evaluates access to

funds by the parent holding company and the Firm™s banks.
Funding Sources of funds 

The deposits held by the RFS,CB,TSS and AM lines of business are a

generally consistent source of funding for JPMorgan Chase Bank,

N.A.As of December 31,2008,total deposits for the Firm were $1.0

trillion,compared with $740.7 billion at December 31,2007.A sig-

nificant portion of the Firm™s deposits are retail deposits,which are

less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility and there-

fore are considered more stable than market-based (i.e.,wholesale)

liability balances.The Washington Mutual transaction added approxi-

mately $159.9 billion of deposits to the Firm,a significant majority

of which are retail deposits.In addition,through the normal course

of business,the Firm benefits from substantial liability balances origi-

nated by RFS,CB,TSS and AM.These franchise-generated liability

balances include deposits and funds that are swept to on-balance
sheet liabilities (e.g.,commercial paper,federal funds purchased and

securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements),a significant

portion of which are considered to be stable and consistent sources
of funding due to the nature of the businesses from which they are
generated.For further discussions of deposit and liability balance

trends,see the discussion of the results for the Firm™s business seg-

ments and the Balance sheet analysis on pages 54Œ72 and 76Œ78,
respectively,of this Annual Report.
Additional sources of funding include a variety of unsecured short-
and long-term instruments,including federal funds purchased,certifi-

cates of deposits,time deposits,bank notes,commercial paper,long-

term debt,trust preferred capital debt securities,preferred stock and

common stock.Secured sources of funding include securities loaned

or sold under repurchase agreements,asset securitizations,borrow-

ings from the Federal Reserve (including discount window borrow-

ings,the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Auction Facility)

and borrowings from the Chicago,Pittsburgh and,as a result of the

Washington Mutual transaction,the San Francisco Federal Home

Loan Banks.However,the Firm does not view borrowings from the

Federal Reserve as a primary means of funding the Firm.
Issuance Funding markets are evaluated on an ongoing basis to achieve an

appropriate global balance of unsecured and secured funding at
favorable rates.Generating funding from a broad range of sources in

a variety of geographic locations enhances financial flexibility and

limits dependence on any one source.
During 2008,JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $42.6 billion of
long-term debt for funding or capital management purposes,including

$20.8 billion of FDIC-guaranteed notes issued under the TLG Program.

The Firm also issued $28.0 billion of IB structured notes,the issuances

of which are generally client-driven and not for funding or capital

management purposes,as the proceeds from such transactions are

generally used to purchase securities to mitigate the risk associated

with structured note exposure.In addition,during the year,the Firm

issued $1.8 billion of trust preferred capital debt securities.During the

same period,the Firm redeemed or had maturities of $62.7 billion of

securities,including $35.8 billion of IB structured notes.
Preferred stock issuances included $6.0 billion and $1.8 billion ofnoncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued on April 23 and

August 21,2008,respectively,as well as preferred stock issued to

the U.S.Treasury on October 28,2008,under the Capital Purchase

Program.In connection with preferred stock issuance under the

Capital Purchase Program,the Firm also issued to the U.S.Treasury

on October 28,2008,a warrant to purchase up to 88,401,697

shares of the Firm™s common stock,at an exercise price of $42.42

per share,subject to certain antidilution and other adjustments.The

Firm has in the past,and may continue in the future,to repurchase

from time to time its debt or trust preferred capital debt securities in

open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions subject

to regulatory and contractual restrictions.
Finally,during 2008,the Firm securitized $21.4 billion of credit card
loans.The ability to securitize loans,and the associated gains on those

securitizations,are principally dependent upon the credit quality and

other characteristics of the assets securitized as well as upon prevailing

market conditions.Given the volatility and stress in the financial mar-

kets in the second half of 2008,the Firm did not securitize any resi-

dential mortgage loans,auto loans or student loans during 2008.
Replacement Capital CovenantsIn connection with the issuance of certain of its trust preferred capi-
tal debt securities and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock,the

Firm entered into Replacement Capital Covenants (ﬁRCCsﬂ) granting

certain rights to the holders of ﬁcovered debt,ﬂas defined in the

RCCs,that prohibit the repayment,redemption or purchase of the

trust preferred capital debt securities and noncumulative perpetual
preferred stock except,with limited exceptions,to the extent that

JPMorgan Chase has received,in each such case,specified amounts

of proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities.Currently

the Firm™s covered debt is its 5.875% Junior Subordinated Deferrable

Interest Debentures,Series O,due in 2035.For more information

regarding these covenants,reference is made to the respective RCCs

entered into by the Firm in connection with the issuances of such

Cash flows For the years ended December 31,2008,2007 and 2006,cash and

due from banks decreased $13.2 billion,$268 million,and increased

$3.7 billion,respectively.The following discussion highlights the

major activities and transactions that affected JPMorgan Chase™s

cash flows during 2008,2007 and 2006.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities JPMorgan Chase™s operating assets and liabilities support the Firm™s

capital markets and lending activities,including the origination or

purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale.The operating

assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of

business due to the amount and timing of cash flows,which are

affected by client-driven activities,market conditions and trading

strategies.Management believes cash flows from operations,avail-

able cash balances and the Firm™s ability to generate cash through

short-and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firm™s

operating liquidity needs.
For the year ended December 31,2008,net cash provided by operat-
ing activities was $23.1 billion,while for the years ended December

31,2007 and 2006,net cash used in operating activities was $110.6

billion and $49.6 billion,respectively.In 2008,net cash generated

from operating activities was higher than net income,largely as a

result of adjustments for operating items such as the provision for

credit losses,depreciation and amortization,stock-based compensa-

tion,and certain other expense.During 2006,2007 and 2008,cash

was used to fund loans held-for-sale,primarily in IB and RFS.During

2008,proceeds from sales of loans originated or purchased with an

initial intent to sell were slightly higher than cash used to acquire
such loans;but the cash flows from these activities were at a signifi-

cantly lower level than for the same periods in 2007 and 2006 as a
result of current market conditions.In 2007 and 2006,cash used to

acquire such loans was slightly higher than proceeds from sales.
For the years ended December 31,2007 and 2006,the net cash
used in operating activities supported growth in the Firm™s lending

and capital markets activities.In 2007,when compared with 2006,

there was a significant decline in cash flows from IB loan origina-

tions/purchases and sale/securitization activities as a result of the
difficult wholesale securitization market and capital markets for

leveraged financings,which were affected by a significant deteriora-

tion in liquidity in the second half of 2007.Cash flows in 2007 asso-

ciated with RFS residential mortgage activities grew,reflecting an

increase in originations.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities The Firm™s investing activities predominantly include originating loans

to be held for investment,other receivables,the available-for-sale

investment portfolio and other short-term investment vehicles.For

the year ended December 31,2008,net cash of $286.3 billion was

used in investing activities,primarily for:purchases of investment

securities in Corporate™s AFS portfolio to manage the Firm™s exposure

to interest rate movements,as well as to make strategic longer-term
investments;increased deposits with banks as the result of the avail-
ability of excess cash for short-term investment opportunities

through interbank lending,and from deposits with the Federal

Reserve (which is now an investing activity,reflecting a policy change

of the Federal Reserve to pay interest to depository institutions on

reserve balances);net additions to the wholesale loan portfolio,from

organic growth in CB;additions to the consumer prime mortgage

portfolio as a result of the decision to retain,rather than sell,new

originations of nonconforming prime mortgage loans;an increase in

securities purchased under resale agreements reflecting growth in
demand from clients for liquidity;and net purchases of asset-backed

commercial paper from money market mutual funds in connection

with a temporary Federal Reserve Bank of Boston lending facility.

Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from sales and

maturities of AFS securities;loan sales and credit card securitization

activities,which were at a lower level than for the same periods in

2007 as a result of the adverse market conditions that have contin-

ued since the last half of 2007;and net cash received from acquisi-

tions and the sale of an investment.Additionally,in June 2008,in

connection with the merger with Bear Stearns,the Firm sold assets

acquired from Bear Stearns to the FRBNY and received cash pro-
ceeds of $28.85 billion (for additional information see Note 2 on
pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report).
For the year ended December 31,2007,net cash of $73.1 billion
was used in investing activities,primarily to fund purchases in the

AFS securities portfolio to manage the Firm™s exposure to interest

rate movements;net additions to the wholesale retained loan portfo-

lios in IB,CB and AM,mainly as a result of business growth;a net

increase in the consumer retained loan portfolio,primarily reflecting

growth in RFS in home equity loans and net additions to RFS™ sub-
prime mortgage loans portfolio (which was affected by manage-

ment™s decision in the third quarter to retain (rather than sell) new

subprime mortgages),and growth in prime mortgage loans originat-

ed by RFS and AM that cannot be sold to U.S.government agencies

or U.S.government-sponsored enterprises;and increases in securities

purchased under resale agreements as a result of a higher level of
cash that was available for short-term investment opportunities in

connection with the Firm™s efforts to build liquidity.These net uses of

cash were partially offset by cash proceeds received from sales and

maturities of AFS securities;and credit card,residential mortgage,

student and wholesale loan sales and securitization activities,which

grew in 2007 despite the difficult conditions in the credit markets.
For the year ended December 31,2006,net cash of $99.6 billion
was used in investing activities.Net cash was invested to fund net

additions to the retained wholesale loan portfolio,mainly resulting

from capital markets activity in IB leveraged financings;increases in

CS loans reflecting strong organic growth;net additions in retail

home equity loans;the acquisition of private-label credit card portfo-

lios from Kohl™s,BP and Pier 1 Imports,Inc.;the acquisition of

Collegiate Funding Services;and purchases of AFS securities in con-

nection with repositioning the portfolio in response to changes in
interest rates.These uses of cash were partially offset by cash pro-

ceeds provided from credit card,residential mortgage,auto and
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
91wholesale loan sales and securitization activities;sales and maturi-
ties of AFS securities;the net decline in auto loans,which was

caused partially by management™s decision to de-emphasize vehicle

leasing;and the sale of the insurance business at the beginning of

the second quarter.
Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesThe Firm™s financing activities primarily reflect cash flows related to

customer deposits,issuances of long-term debt and trust preferred

capital debt securities,and issuances of preferred and common

stock.In 2008,net cash provided by financing activities was $250.5

billion due to:growth in wholesale deposits,in particular,interest-

and noninterest-bearing deposits in TSS (driven by both new and

existing clients,and due to the deposit inflows related to the height-

ened volatility and credit concerns affecting the global markets),as

well as increases in AM and CB (due to organic growth);proceeds of

$25.0 billion from the issuance of preferred stock and a warrant to

the U.S.Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program;additional

issuances of common stock and preferred stock used for general cor-

porate purposes;an increase in other borrowings due to nonrecourse

secured advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to fund

the purchase of asset-backed commercial paper from money market

mutual funds;increases in federal funds purchased and securities

loaned or sold under repurchase agreements in connection with
higher short-term requirements to fulfill client demand for liquidity

and finance the Firm™s AFS securities inventory;and a net increase in

long-term debt due to a combination of non-FDIC guaranteed debt

and trust preferred capital debt securities issued prior to December
4,2008,and the issuance of $20.8 billion of FDIC-guaranteed long-

term debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2008.The fourth-quar-

ter FDIC-guaranteed issuance was offset partially by maturities of

non-FDIC guaranteed long-term debt during the same period.The

increase in long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt securities

was used primarily to fund certain illiquid assets held by the parent

holding company and build liquidity.Cash was also used to pay divi-

dends on common and preferred stock.The Firm did not repurchase

any shares of its common stock in the open market during 2008 in

order to maintain its capital objectives.
In 2007,net cash provided by financing activities was $183.0 billion
due to a net increase in wholesale deposits from growth in business
volumes,in particular,interest-bearing deposits at TSS,AM and CB;
net issuances of long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt
securities primarily to fund certain illiquid assets held by the parent
holding company and build liquidity,and by IB from client-driven

structured notes transactions;and growth in commercial paper

issuances and other borrowed funds due to growth in the volume of
liability balances in sweep accounts in TSS and CB,and to fund trad-

ing positions and to further build liquidity.Cash was used to repur-

chase common stock and pay dividends on common stock,including

an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2007.In 2006,net cash provided by financing activities was $152.7 billion
due to net cash received from growth in deposits,reflecting new

retail account acquisitions and the ongoing expansion of the retail
branch distribution network;higher wholesale business volumes;

increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements to fund
trading positions and higher AFS securities positions;and net

issuances of long-term debt and trust preferred capital debt securi-

ties.The net cash provided was offset partially by the payment of

cash dividends on stock and common stock repurchases.
Credit ratings 
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings.

Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the

Firm™s access to liquidity sources,increase the cost of funds,trigger

additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the num-

ber of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm.
Additionally,the Firm™s funding requirements for VIEs and other

third-party commitments may be adversely affected.For additional

information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the

funding requirements for VIEs,and on derivatives and collateral

agreements,see Special-purpose entities on pages 79Œ80 and

Ratings profile of derivative receivables marked to market (ﬁMTMﬂ)

on page 100 of this Annual Report.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and
diverse earnings stream,strong capital ratios,strong credit quality

and risk management controls,diverse funding sources,and disci-

plined liquidity monitoring procedures.
The credit ratings of the parent holding company and each of the Firm™s significant banking subsidiaries as of January 15,2009,

short-term debt ratings of its principal bank subsidiaries.These actions

were primarily the result of S&P™s belief that the Firm™s earnings are

likely to decline over the next couple of years in response to increas-

ing loan losses associated with the Firm™s exposure to consumer

lending,as well as declining business volumes.S&P™s current outlook

is negative.On January 15,2009,Moody™s lowered the senior long-

term debt ratings on JPMorgan Chase & Co.and its principal bank

subsidiaries from ﬁAa2ﬂand ﬁAaaﬂ,respectively.These actions were

primarily the result of Moody™s view that,in the current economic

environment,the Firm may experience difficulties generating capital

and could face significant earnings pressure.Moody™s affirmed the

short-term debt ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co.and its principal

bank subsidiaries at ﬁP-1ﬂ.Moody™s also revised the outlook to 

stable from negative due to the Firm™s strong capital ratios,signifi-

cant loan loss reserves,and strong franchise.Ratings from Fitch on
JPMorgan Chase & Co.and its principal bank subsidiaries remained
unchanged from December 31,2007,and Fitch™s outlook remained

stable.The recent rating actions by S&P and Moody™s did not have a

material impact on the cost or availability of the Firm™s funding.If the

Firm™s senior long-term debt ratings were downgraded by one addi-

tional notch,the Firm believes the incremental cost of funds or loss

of funding would be manageable within the context of current mar-
ket conditions and the Firm™s liquidity resources.JPMorgan Chase™s

unsecured debt,other than in certain cases IB structured notes,does

not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of pay-

ments,maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt,nor

contain collateral provisions or the creation of an additional financial

obligation,based on unfavorable changes in the Firm™s credit ratings,

financial ratios,earnings,cash flows or stock price.To the extent any

IB structured notes do contain such provisions,the Firm believes

that,in the event of an acceleration of payments or maturities or

provision of collateral,the securities used by the Firm to risk manage

such structured notes,together with other liquidity resources,are

expected to generate funds sufficient to satisfy the Firm™s obligations.
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default.The

Firm provides credit (for example,through loans,lending-related

commitments and derivatives) to a variety of customers,from large

corporate and institutional clients to the individual consumer.For the

wholesale business,credit risk management includes the distribution

of syndicated loans originated by the Firm into the marketplace (pri-

marily to IB clients),with exposure held in the retained portfolio

averaging less than 10% of the total originated loans.Wholesale

loans generated by CB and AM are generally retained on the balance

sheet.With regard to the consumer credit market,the Firm focuses

on creating a portfolio that is diversified from both a product and a
geographic perspective.Loss mitigation strategies are being

employed for all home lending portfolios.These strategies include

rate reductions,principal forgiveness,forbearance and other actions

intended to minimize the economic loss and avoid foreclosure.In the

mortgage business,originated loans are either retained in the mort-

gage portfolio or securitized and sold to U.S.government agencies

and U.S.government-sponsored enterprises.
Credit risk organization 
Credit risk management is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer and
implemented within the lines of business.The Firm™s credit risk man-

agement governance consists of the following functions:†establishing a comprehensive credit risk policy framework 
†monitoring and managing credit risk across all portfolio seg-
ments,including transaction and line approval
†assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the
approval of all credit exposure 
†managing criticized exposures 

†calculating the allowance for credit losses and ensuring appropri-
ate credit risk-based capital managementRisk identification The Firm is exposed to credit risk through lending and capital mar-

kets activities.The credit risk management organization works in

partnership with the business segments in identifying and aggregat-
ing exposures across all lines of business.
Risk measurement 
To measure credit risk,the Firm employs several methodologies for

estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.

Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several

factors,including type of asset (e.g.,consumer installment versus

wholesale loan),risk measurement parameters (e.g.,delinquency sta-

tus and credit bureau score versus wholesale risk rating) and risk

management and collection processes (e.g.,retail collection center

versus centrally managed workout groups).Credit risk measurement

is based upon the amount of exposure should the obligor or the
counterparty default,the probability of default and the loss severity

given a default event.Based upon these factors and related market-

based inputs,the Firm estimates both probable and unexpected loss-

es for the wholesale and consumer portfolios.Probable losses,

reflected in the provision for credit losses,are based primarily upon

statistical estimates of credit losses as a result of obligor or counter-
party default.However,probable losses are not the sole indicators of

risk.If losses were entirely predictable,the probable loss rate could

be factored into pricing and covered as a normal and recurring cost
of doing business.Unexpected losses,reflected in the allocation of

credit risk capital,represent the potential volatility of actual losses

relative to the probable level of losses.Risk measurement for the

wholesale portfolio is assessed primarily on a risk-rated basis;for the

consumer portfolio,it is assessed primarily on a credit-scored basis.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
93Risk-rated exposure For portfolios that are risk-rated (generally held in IB,CB,TSS and
AM),probable and unexpected loss calculations are based upon esti-

mates of probability of default and loss given default.Probability of

default is the expected default calculated on an obligor basis.Loss

given default is an estimate of losses given a default event and takes

into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit

facility.Calculations and assumptions are based upon management

information systems and methodologies which are under continual
review.Risk ratings are assigned to differentiate risk within the port-

folio and are reviewed on an ongoing basis by credit risk manage-
ment and revised,if needed,to reflect the borrowers™ current risk

profiles and the related collateral and structural positions.
Credit-scored exposure 
For credit-scored portfolios (generally held in RFS and CS),probable

loss is based upon a statistical analysis of inherent losses over dis-
crete periods of time.Probable losses are estimated using sophisti-

cated portfolio modeling,credit scoring and decision-support tools to

project credit risks and establish underwriting standards.In addition,

common measures of credit quality derived from historical loss expe-

rience are used to predict consumer losses.Other risk characteristics

evaluated include recent loss experience in the portfolios,changes in

origination sources,portfolio seasoning,loss severity and underlying

credit practices,including charge-off policies.These analyses are

applied to the Firm™s current portfolios in order to estimate delin-

quencies and severity of losses,which determine the amount of

probable losses.These factors and analyses are updated at least on a

quarterly basis or more frequently as market conditions dictate.
Risk monitoring The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to

preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision

making of extending credit and are intended to ensure credit risks
are assessed accurately,approved properly,monitored regularly and

managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.The

policy framework establishes credit approval authorities,concentra-

tion limits,risk-rating methodologies,portfolio review parameters

and guidelines for management of distressed exposure.Wholesale

credit risk is monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level
and on an individual customer basis.Management of the Firm™s

wholesale exposure is accomplished through a number of means
including loan syndication and participations,loan sales,securitiza-

tions,credit derivatives,use of master netting agreements and collat-

eral and other risk-reduction techniques,which are further discussed

in the following risk sections.For consumer credit risk,the key focus

items are trends and concentrations at the portfolio level,whereby

potential problems can be remedied through changes in underwrit-
ing policies and portfolio guidelines.Consumer Credit Risk

Management monitors trends against business expectations and
industry benchmarks.
Risk reporting 
To enable monitoring of credit risk and decision-making,aggregate

credit exposure,credit quality forecasts,concentrations levels and risk

profile changes are reported regularly to senior credit risk manage-
ment.Detailed portfolio reporting of industry,customer and geo-

graphic concentrations occurs monthly,and the appropriateness of

the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at

least on a quarterly basis.Through the risk reporting and governance

structure,credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regular-

ly to,and discussed with,senior management,for further informa-

tion,see page 86 of this Annual Report.
2008 Credit risk overview 
During 2008,credit markets experienced deterioration and increased

defaults and downgrades reflecting,among other things,reduced liq-

uidity.The liquidity and credit crisis has adversely affected many

financial institutions,resulting in the failure of some in both the U.S.

and Europe,and has impacted the functioning of credit markets,par-

ticularly,the loan syndication and asset-backed securitization mar-

kets.The Firm™s credit portfolio was affected by these market condi-

tions and experienced deteriorating credit quality,especially in the

latter part of the year,generally consistent with the market.In 2008,

for the wholesale portfolio,criticized assets and NPAs increased,

from historical lows,301% and 525%,respectively,from the previ-

ous year.Charge-offs,which typically lag other portfolio deteriora-

tion,have increased from historical lows by 458% over 2007.The

Firm has remained focused on aggressively managing the portfolio,

including ongoing,in-depth reviews of credit quality,as well as of

revisions of industry,product and client concentrations.Risk levels

are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm™s risk tolerance.

Underwriting standards across all areas of lending have been
strengthened,consistent with evolving market conditions in order to

permit the Firm to lend in a safe and prudent manner.In light of the

current market conditions,the wholesale allowance for loan loss cov-

erage ratio has been strengthened to 2.64%,from 1.67% at the end

of 2007.Consumer portfolio credit performance continues to be negativelyaffected by the economic environment,particularly the weak labor

market and the decline in housing prices which occurred nationally.

As a result,the Firm took actions throughout the year to reduce risk

exposure by tightening underwriting and loan qualification standards
in those markets most affected by the housing downturn.In the

fourth quarter of 2008,the Firm announced plans to significantly

expand loss mitigation efforts related to its mortgage and home
equity portfolios.During the implementation period of these expand-

ed loss mitigation efforts,which was substantially in place in early

2009,the Firm did not place loans into foreclosure.These loss miti-

gation efforts are expected to result in additional increases in the
balance of modified loans carried on the Firm™s balance sheet,

including loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings,while

minimizing the economic loss to the Firm and assisting homeowners
to remain in their homes.
More detailed discussion of the domestic consumer credit environ-ment can be found on pages 103Œ108 of this Annual Report.
Management’s discussion and analysis
94JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
CREDIT PORTFOLIO    
The following table presents JPMorgan Chase™s credit portfolio as of
December 31,2008 and 2007.Total credit exposure at December 31,

2008,increased $198.8 billion from December 31,2007,reflecting an

increase of $115.0 billion in the consumer credit portfolio and $83.8
billion in the wholesale credit portfolio.The increase in total credit

exposure from the prior year reflects $319.2 billion and $54.3 billion
of additional credit exposure acquired in connection with the
Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns transactions,respectively.The

exposure from the Washington Mutual transaction consisted of $271.7

billion in the consumer portfolio and $47.5 billion in the wholesale
portfolio,which was primarily commercial lending.The exposure from
the Bear Stearns acquisition was included in the wholesale portfolio.
Excluding these two transactions,there was a decrease of $174.7 bil-

lion in overall credit exposure,which was largely driven by decreases in

lending-related commitments,partly offset by increases in derivative

receivables and managed loans.
While overall portfolio exposure declined when excluding the
Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns transactions,the Firm provided

over $150 billion in new loans and lines of credit to retail and whole-
sale clients in the fourth quarter of 2008,including individual con-

sumers,small businesses,large corporations,not-for-profit organiza-

tions,states and municipalities,and other financial institutions.
In the table below,reported loans include loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale,which are carried at lower 
of cost or fair value,
with changes in value recorded in noninterest revenue.However,these held-for-sale loans and loans accounted for at fair value a
re excluded from theaverage loan balances used for the net charge-off rate calculations.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
95WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
As of December 31,2008,wholesale exposure (IB,CB,TSS and AM)
increased $83.8 billion from December 31,2007,primarily due to

the Bear Stearns merger,which added $54.3 billion of wholesale

exposure in the second quarter of 2008 ($26.0 billion of receivables

from customers,$18.9 billion of derivative receivables,$5.0 billion of

lending-related commitments and $4.4 billion of loans) and the
Washington Mutual transaction (which added $47.5 billion of whole-

sale exposure in the third quarter of 2008,mainly consisting of

loans).Excluding these two 
transactions,the portfolio decreased
$18.0 billion,largely driven by decreases
of $73.7 billion in lending-related commitments and $9.9 billion in receivables from customers.

Partly offsetting these decreases was an increase of $65.5 billion in

derivative receivables.The decrease in lending-related commitments
was largely related to a reduction in multi-seller conduit-related com-
mitments.The increase in derivative receivables was primarily related

to the decline in interest rates,widening credit spreads and volatile

foreign exchange rates reflected in interest rate,credit and foreign

exchange derivatives,respectively.For additional information regard-

ing conduit-related commitments,see Note 17 on pages 189Œ198 of

this Annual Report.
Excluding the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns transactions,
retained loans increased $11.0 billion reflecting increases in traditional

lending activity while loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value

decreased reflecting sales,reduced carrying values and lower volumes

in the syndication market.

97Wholesale credit exposure Œ selected industry concentration
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its indus-

try concentrations,with particular attention paid to industries with

actual or potential credit concerns.At December 31,2008,the top

15 industries to which the Firm is exposed remained largely
unchanged from December 31,2007.The Firm™s real estate industry

exposure increased from the prior year due to the Washington
Mutual transaction.Customer receivables of $16.1 billion in the
table below represents primarily margin loans to prime and retail
brokerage clients acquired in the Bear Stearns merger.These margin

loans are generally fully collateralized by cash or highly liquid securi-

ties to satisfy daily minimum collateral requirements.For additional

information on industry concentrations,see Note 34 on pages

222Œ223 of this Annual Report.

Wholesale criticized exposure
Exposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile similar

to a rating of ﬁCCC+ﬂ/ﬂCaa1ﬂand lower,as defined by S&P and

Moody™s.The total criticized component of the portfolio,excluding

loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,increased to $26.0 billion at

December 31,2008,from $6.8 billion at year-end 2007.The increase

was driven primarily by downgrades in the wholesale portfolio.

Presented below is a discussion of several industries to which the
Firm has significant exposure,as well as industries the Firm contin-

ues to monitor because of actual or potential credit concerns.For

additional information,refer to the tables above and on the preced-

ing page.
†Real estate:Exposure to this industry grew in 2008 due to the
Washington Mutual transaction,with approximately 70% of this

increase consisting of exposure to multi-family lending.
Approximately 45% of the real estate exposure is to large real

estate companies and institutions (e.g.REITS),professional real

estate developers,owners,or service providers,and generally

involves real estate leased to third-party tenants.Commercial

construction and development accounted for approximately 13%

of the real estate portfolio at 2008 year-end.Exposure to nation-

al and regional single family homebuilders decreased 31% from
2007 and represented 5% of the portfolio at 2008 year-end.The

increase in criticized exposure was largely a result of downgrades

to select names within the portfolio,primarily in IB,reflecting the

weakening credit environment.The remaining increase in criti-

cized exposure reflected exposures acquired in the Washington

Mutual transaction.
†Banks and finance companies:Exposure to this industry increased
primarily as a result of higher derivative exposure to commercial

banks due to higher volatility and greater trade volume and to

the addition of derivative positions from the Bear Stearns merger.

The percentage of the portfolio that is investment grade has

declined slightly from 2007 as a result of the impact of the
weakening credit environment on financial counterparties.The

growth in criticized exposure was primarily a result of down-

grades to specialty finance companies,reflected in loans and

lending-related commitments.
†Automotive:Industry conditions deteriorated significantly in
2008,particularly in North America,and are expected to remain

under pressure in 2009.The largest percentage of the Firm™s

wholesale criticized exposure in this segment is related to
Original Equipment Manufacturers.However,a majority of the

year-over-year increase in criticized exposure related to automo-

tive suppliers which were negatively affected by significant
declines in automotive production.Most of the Firm™s criticized

exposure in this segment remains performing and is substantially
secured.†Asset Managers:Exposure in this industry grew from 2007 as a
result of increased derivative exposure to primarily investment

grade funds and the acquisition of loans and lending-related

commitments to this industry due to the Bear Stearns merger.
†All other:All other in the wholesale credit exposure concentration
table on page 97 of this Annual Report at December 31,2008

included $278.1 billion of credit exposure to 17 industry seg-
ments.Exposures related to SPEs and high-net-worth individuals

were 37% and 19%,respectively,of this category.SPEs provide

secured financing (generally backed by receivables,loans or
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
99bonds on a bankruptcy-remote,nonrecourse or limited-recourse
basis) originated by a diverse group of companies in industries
that are not highly correlated.For further discussion of SPEs,see

Note 17 on pages 189Œ198 of this Annual Report.The remaining

all other exposure is well-diversified across industries and none
comprise more than 2% of total exposure.
Derivative contracts
In the normal course of business,the Firm uses derivative instruments

to meet the needs of customers;generate revenue through trading

activities;manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates,currencies

and other markets;and manage the Firm™s credit exposure.The

notional amount of the Firm™s derivative contracts outstanding signifi-

cantly exceeded,in the Firm™s view,the possible credit losses that

could arise from such transactions.For most derivative transactions,

the notional amount does not change hands;it is used simply as a

reference to calculate payments.For further discussion of these con-

tracts,see Note 32 and Note 34 on pages 214Œ217 and 222Œ223 of

this Annual Report.

The amount of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets of $162.6 billion and $77.1 billion at December 31,
2008 and 2007,respectively,is the amount of the mark-to-market

value (ﬁMTMﬂ) or fair value of the derivative contracts after giving

effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash col-

lateral held by the Firm.These amounts represent the cost to the

Firm to replace the contracts at current market rates should the

counterparty default.However,in management™s view,the appropri-

ate measure of current credit risk should also reflect additional liquid
securities held as collateral by the Firm of $19.8 billion and $9.8 bil-

lion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,resulting in total

exposure,net of all collateral,of $142.8 billion and $67.3 billion at

December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.Derivative receivables,

net of collateral,increased $75.5 billion from December 31,2007,

primarily related to the decline in interest rates,widening credit

spreads and volatile foreign exchange rates reflected in interest rate,

credit and foreign exchange derivatives,respectively.The increase in

2008 also included positions acquired in the Bear Stearns merger.
The Firm also holds additional collateral delivered by clients at the initi-
ation of transactions,and although this collateral does not reduce the

balances noted in the table above,it is available as security against

potential exposure that could arise should the MTM of the client™s

transactions move in the Firm™s favor.As of December 31,2008 and

2007,the Firm held $22.2 billion and $17.4 billion of this additional

collateral,respectively.The derivative receivables MTM also do not

include other credit enhancements in the form of letters of credit.While useful as a current view of credit exposure,the net MTM value
of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future

variability of that credit exposure.To capture the potential future

variability of credit exposure,the Firm calculates,on a client-by-client

basis,three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss:

Peak,Derivative Risk Equivalent (ﬁDREﬂ),and Average exposure

(ﬁAVGﬂ).These measures all incorporate netting and collateral bene-

fits,where applicable.
Peak exposure to a counterparty is a measure of exposure calculated
at a 97.5% confidence level.Derivative Risk Equivalent exposure is a

measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis

intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures.The measure-

ment is done by equating the unexpected loss in a derivative coun-

terparty exposure (which takes into consideration both the loss
Management’s discussion and analysis
100JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
volatility and the credit rating of the counterparty) with the unex-
pected loss in a loan exposure (which takes into consideration only

the credit rating of the counterparty).DRE is a less extreme measure

of potential credit loss than Peak and is the primary measure used by

the Firm for credit approval of derivative transactions.
Finally,AVG is a measure of the expected MTM value of the Firm™s
derivative receivables at future time periods,including the benefit of

collateral.AVG exposure over the total life of the derivative contract

is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to cal-
culate credit capital and the Credit Valuation Adjustment (ﬁCVAﬂ),as

further described below.Average exposure was $83.7 billion and

$47.1 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,com-

pared with derivative receivables MTM,net of all collateral,of

$142.8 billion and $67.3 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,

respectively.
The MTM value of the Firm™s derivative receivables incorporates an
adjustment,the CVA,to reflect the credit quality of counterparties.

The CVA is based upon the Firm™s AVG to a counterparty and the

counterparty™s credit spread in the credit derivatives market.The pri-

mary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads,new deal

activity or unwinds,and changes in the underlying market environ-

ment.The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to
controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio.In
addition,the Firm takes into consideration the potential for correla-

tion between the Firm™s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty™s

credit quality within the credit approval process.The Firm risk man-

ages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative

transactions,as well as interest rate,foreign exchange,equity and

commodity derivative transactions.
The graph below shows exposure profiles to derivatives over the next
ten years as calculated by the DRE and AVG metrics.The two meas-

ures generally show declining exposure after the first year,if no new

trades were added to the portfolio.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
101The increase in noninvestment grade derivative receivables reflects a
weakening credit environment.The Firm actively pursues the use of

collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in deriva-

tives.The percentage of the Firm™s derivatives transactions subject to

collateral agreements was 83% as of December 31,2008,largely

unchanged from 82% at December 31,2007.
The Firm posted $99.1 billion and $33.5 billion of collateral at
December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.
Certain derivative and collateral agreements include provisions that
require the counterparty and/or the Firm,upon specified downgrades

in their respective credit ratings,to post collateral for the benefit of

the other party.The impact of a single-notch ratings downgrade to

JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,from its rating of ﬁAA-ﬂto ﬁA+ﬂat

December 31,2008,would have required $2.2 billion of additional

collateral to be posted by the Firm.The impact of a six-notch ratings

downgrade (from ﬁAA-ﬂto ﬁBBB-ﬂ) would have required $6.4 billion

of additional collateral.Certain derivative contracts also provide for

termination of the contract,generally upon a downgrade of either

the Firm or the counterparty,at the then-existing MTM value of the

derivative contracts.
Credit derivatives 
Credit derivatives are financial contracts that isolate credit risk from

an underlying instrument (such as a loan or security) and transfer that

risk from one party (the buyer of credit protection) to another (the

seller of credit protection).The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of

credit protection.As a purchaser of credit protection,the Firm has risk

that the counterparty providing the credit protection will default.As a

seller of credit protection,the Firm has risk that the underlying instru-

ment referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.Of

the Firm™s $162.6 billion of total derivative receivables MTM at

December 31,2008,$44.7 billion,or 27%,was associated with cred-

it derivatives,before the benefit of liquid securities collateral.
One type of credit derivatives the Firm enters into with counterpar-
ties are credit default swaps (ﬁCDSﬂ).For further detailed discussion

of these and other types of credit derivatives,see Note 32 on pages

214Œ217 of this Annual Report.The large majority of CDS are sub-

ject to collateral arrangements to protect the Firm from counterparty

credit risk.In 2008,the frequency and size of defaults for both trad-

ing counterparties and the underlying debt referenced in credit deriv-
atives were well above historical norms.The use of collateral to settle

against defaulting counterparties generally performed as designed in

significantly mitigating the Firm™s exposure to these counterparties.
During 2008,the Firm worked with other significant market partici-
pants to develop mechanisms to reduce counterparty credit risk,
including the cancellation of offsetting trades.In 2009,it is anticipat-

ed that one or more central counterparties for CDS will be estab-

lished and JPMorgan Chase will face these central counterparties,or

clearing houses,for an increasing portion of its CDS business.
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes:first,in its
capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business to meet the

needs of customers;and second,in order to mitigate the Firm™s own

credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and tradi-

tional commercial credit lending exposures (loans and unfunded
commitments),as well as its exposure to residential and commercial

mortgages.
The following table presents the Firm™s notional amounts of credit
derivatives protection purchased and sold as of December 31,2008

and 2007,distinguishing between dealer/client activity and credit

portfolio activity.

(a)Includes $3.9 trillion at December 31,2008,of notional exposure within protection
purchased and protection sold where the underlying reference instrument is identi-
cal.The remaining exposure includes single name and index CDS which the Firm

purchased to manage the remaining net protection sold.For a further discussion on

credit derivatives,see Note 32 on pages 214Œ217 of this Annual Report.
(b)Includes $34.9 billion and $31.1 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respec-
tively,that represented the notional amount for structured portfolio protection;the

Firm retains a minimal first risk of loss on this portfolio.
Dealer/client businessWithin the dealer/client business,the Firm actively utilizes credit
derivatives by buying and selling credit protection,predominantly on

corporate debt obligations,in response to client demand for credit

risk protection on the underlying reference instruments.Protection

may be bought or sold by the Firm on single reference debt instru-
ments (ﬁsingle-nameﬂcredit derivatives),portfolios of referenced

instruments (ﬁportfolioﬂcredit derivatives) or quoted indices

(ﬁindexedﬂcredit derivatives).The risk positions are largely matched

as the Firm™s exposure to a given reference entity under a contract to

sell protection to a counterparty may be offset partially,or entirely,

with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on

the same underlying instrument.Any residual default exposure and

spread risk is actively managed by the Firm™s various trading desks.
At December 31,2008,the total notional amount of protection pur-
chased and sold increased $421 billion from year-end 2007.The

increase was primarily as a result of the merger with Bear Stearns,

partially offset by the impact of industry efforts to reduce offsetting
trade activity.
Credit portfolio activities
In managing its wholesale credit exposure the Firm purchases pro-
tection through single-name and portfolio credit derivatives to man-

age the credit risk associated with loans,lending-related commit-

ments and derivative receivables.Gains or losses on the credit deriv-

atives are expected to offset the unrealized increase or decrease in
Management’s discussion and analysis
102JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
credit risk on the loans,lending-related commitments or derivative
receivables.This activity does not reduce the reported level of assets

on the balance sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheet com-
mitments,though it does provide the Firm with credit risk protection.

The Firm also diversifies its exposures by selling credit protection,

which increases exposure to industries or clients where the Firm has
little or no client-related exposure,however,this activity is not mate-

rial to the Firm™s overall credit exposure.

The credit derivatives used by JPMorgan Chase for credit portfolio
management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under
SFAS 133,and therefore,effectiveness testing under SFAS 133 is not

performed.Loan interest and fees are generally recognized in net

interest income,and impairment is recognized in the provision for

credit losses.This asymmetry in accounting treatment between loans

and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives utilized

in credit portfolio management activities causes earnings volatility
that is not representative,in the Firm™s view,of the true changes in

value of the Firm™s overall credit exposure.The MTM related to the

Firm™s credit derivatives used for managing credit exposure,as well

as the MTM related to the CVA,which reflects the credit quality of

derivatives counterparty exposure,are included in the table below.

These results can vary from period to period due to market condi-

tions that impact specific positions in the portfolio.For a further dis-

cussion of credit derivatives,see Note 32 on pages 214Œ217 of this

incorporates an adjustment to the valuation of the Firm™s derivative liabilities as a

result of the adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1,2007.
The Firm also actively manages wholesale credit exposure through IB
and CB loan and commitment sales.During 2008,2007 and 2006,

these sales of $3.9 billion,$4.9 billion and $4.0 billion of loans and

commitments,respectively,resulted in losses of $41 million and $7

million in 2008 and 2007 and gains of $83 million in 2006,respec-
tively.These results include gains on sales of nonperforming loans,as
discussed on page 95 of this Annual Report.These activities are not

related to the Firm™s securitization activities,which are undertaken

for liquidity and balance sheet management purposes.For a further

discussion of securitization activity,see Liquidity Risk Management

and Note 16 on pages 88Œ92 and 180Œ188,respectively,of this

Annual Report.Lending-related commitments
Wholesale lending-related commitments were $379.9 billion at
December 31,2008,compared with $446.7 billion at December 31,

2007.The decrease was largely related to a reduction in multi-seller

conduit-related commitments.In the Firm™s view,the total contractual

amount of these instruments is not representative of the Firm™s actual

credit risk exposure or funding requirements.In determining the

amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-
related commitments,which is used as the basis for allocating credit

risk capital to these instruments,the Firm has established a ﬁloan-

equivalentﬂamount for each commitment;this amount represents

the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure
that is expected,based upon average portfolio historical experience,

to become outstanding in the event of a default by an obligor.The

loan-equivalent amount of the Firm™s lending-related commitments

was $204.3 billion and $238.7 billion as of December 31,2008 and

2007,respectively.
Emerging markets country exposure
The Firm has a comprehensive internal process for measuring and

managing exposures to emerging markets countries.There is no com-

mon definition of emerging markets but the Firm generally,though

not exclusively,includes in its definition those countries whose sover-

eign debt ratings are equivalent to ﬁA+ﬂor lower.Exposures to a

country include all credit-related lending,trading and investment

activities,whether cross-border or locally funded.In addition to mon-

itoring country exposures,the Firm uses stress tests to measure and

manage the risk of extreme loss associated with sovereign crises.
The following table presents the Firm™s exposure to the top five
emerging markets countries.The selection of countries is based solely

on the Firm™s largest total exposures by country and not the Firm™s

view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.Exposure

is reported based upon the country where the assets of the obligor,

counterparty or guarantor are located.Exposure amounts are adjust-

ed for collateral and for credit enhancements (e.g.,guarantees and

letters of credit) provided by third parties;outstandings supported by

a guarantor outside the country or backed by collateral held outside

the country are assigned to the country of the enhancement provider.

In addition,the effects of credit derivative hedges and other short

credit or equity trading positions are reflected in the following table.

Total exposure includes exposure to both government and private

sector entities in a country.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
103CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
JPMorgan Chase™s consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential
mortgages,home equity loans,credit cards,auto loans,student loans

and business banking loans,with a primary focus on serving the

prime consumer credit market.The consumer credit portfolio also

includes certain loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction,

primarily mortgage,home equity and credit card loans.The RFS port-

folio includes home equity lines of credit and mortgage loans with
interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers,as

well as certain payment option loans acquired from Washington

Mutual that may result in negative amortization.A substantial portion of the consumer loans acquired in theWashington Mutual transaction were identified as credit-impaired in

the third quarter of 2008 based on a preliminary analysis of the
acquired portfolio.In addition,as of the acquisition date,a $1.4 billion

accounting conformity provision was recorded to reflect the Firm™s 

preliminary estimate of incurred losses related to the portion of the
acquired consumer loans that were not considered to be credit-
impaired.During the fourth quarter of 2008,the analysis of acquired

loans was substantially completed,resulting in a $12.4 billion increase

in the credit-impaired loan balances and a corresponding decrease in
the non-credit-impaired loan balances.In addition,the estimate of

incurred losses related to the non-credit-impaired portfolio was final-

ized,resulting in a $476 million decrease in the accounting conformity

provision for these loans.The purchased credit-impaired loans,which

were identified as impaired based on an analysis of risk characteristics,

including product type,loan-to-value ratios,FICO scores and delin-

quency status,are accounted for under SOP 03-3 and were recorded

at fair value under SOP 03-3 as of the acquisition date.The fair value

of these loans includes an estimate of losses that are expected to be
incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loans,and therefore

no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans as of the

transaction date.
The credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire
consumer credit product spectrum continues to be negatively affected
by the economic environment.High unemployment and weaker over-

all economic conditions have resulted in increased delinquencies,and

continued weak housing prices have driven a significant increase in
loss severity.Nonperforming loans and assets continued to increase

through year-end 2008,a key indicator that charge-offs will continue

to rise in 2009.Additional deterioration in the overall economic envi-

ronment,including continued deterioration in the labor market,could

cause delinquencies to increase beyond the Firm™s current expecta-

tions,resulting in significant increases in losses in 2009.
Over the past year,the Firm has taken actions to reduce risk exposure
by tightening both underwriting and loan qualification standards for
real estate lending,as well as for consumer lending for non-real

estate products.Tighter income verification,more conservative collat-

eral valuation,reduced loan-to-value maximums and higher FICO and

custom risk score requirements are just some of the actions taken to

date to mitigate risk.These actions have resulted in significant reduc-

tions in new originations of ﬁrisk layeredﬂloans (e.g.,loans with high

loan-to-value ratios to borrowers with low FICO scores) and improved

alignment of loan pricing.New originations of subprime mortgage

loans,option ARMs and broker originated-mortgage and home equity

loans have been eliminated entirely.
In the fourth quarter of 2008,the Firm announced plans to signifi-
cantly expand loss mitigation efforts related to its mortgage and
home equity portfolios,including a systematic review of the real

estate portfolio to identify homeowners most in need of assistance.In

addition,the Firm announced plans to open regional counseling cen-

ters,hire additional loan counselors,introduce new financing alterna-

tives,proactively reach out to borrowers to offer pre-qualified modifi-

cations,and commence a new process to independently review each

loan before moving it into the foreclosure process.During the imple-
mentation period of these loss mitigation efforts,which were substan-

tially complete in early 2009,the Firm did not place loans into fore-

closure.These loss mitigation efforts,which generally represent vari-

ous forms of term extensions,rate reductions and forbearances,are
expected to result in additional increases in the balances of modifiedloans carried on the Firm™s balance sheet,including loans accounted

for as troubled debt restructurings,while minimizing the economic

loss to the Firm and assisting homeowners to remain in their homes.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
105The Firm regularly evaluates market conditions and overall economic
returns and makes an initial determination of whether new origina-

tions will be held-for-investment or sold within the foreseeable future.

The Firm also periodically evaluates the expected economic returns of

previously originated loans under prevailing market conditions to

determine whether their designation as held-for-sale or held-for-

investment continues to be appropriate.When the Firm determines

that a change in this designation is appropriate,the loans are trans-

ferred to the appropriate classification.During the third and fourth

quarters of 2007,in response to changes in market conditions,the

Firm designated as held-for-investment all new originations of sub-

prime mortgage loans,as well as subprime mortgage loans that were

previously designated held-for-sale.In addition,all new prime mort-

gage originations that cannot be sold to U.S.government agencies

and U.S.government-sponsored enterprises have been designated as

held-for-investment.Prime mortgage loans originated with the intent

to sell are accounted for at fair value under SFAS 159 and are classi-

fied as trading assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-relat-
ed categories within the consumer portfolio.Information regarding

combined loan-to-value ratios (ﬁCLTVsﬂ) and loan-to-value ratios

(ﬁLTVsﬂ) were estimated based on the initial appraisal obtained at the

time of origination,adjusted using relevant market indicies for hous-

ing price changes that have occurred since origination.The estimated

value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to

changes in condition of the underlying property,variations in housing

price changes within metropolitan statistical areas (ﬁMSAsﬂ) and
other factors.
Home equity:Home equity loans at December 31,2008,were
$114.3 billion,excluding purchased credit-impaired loans,an increase

of $19.5 billion from year-end 2007,primarily reflecting the addition

of loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.The 2008

provision for credit losses for the home equity portfolio includes net
increases of $2.2 billion to the allowance for loan losses for 2008 for

the heritage JPMorgan Chase portfolio as a result of the economic
environment noted above.The Firm estimates that loans with effective

CLTVs in excess of 100% represented approximately 22% of the

home equity portfolio.In response to continued economic weakness,

loan underwriting and account management criteria have been tight-
ened,with a particular focus on MSAs with the most significant hous-

ing price declines.New originations of home equity loans have
decreased significantly,as additional loss mitigation strategies have
been employed;these strategies include the elimination of stated

income and broker originated loans,a significant reduction of maxi-

mum CLTVs for new originations,which now range from 50% to

70%,and additional restrictions on new originations in geographic

areas experiencing the greatest housing price depreciation and high-
est unemployment.Other loss mitigation strategies include the reduc-

tion or closure of outstanding credit lines for borrowers who have
experienced significant increases in CLTVs or decreases in creditwor-

thiness (e.g.declines in FICO scores.) 
Mortgage:Mortgage loans at December 31,2008,which include
prime mortgages,subprime mortgages,option ARMs and loans held-

for-sale,were $96.8 billion,excluding purchased credit-impaired

loans,reflecting a $40.8 billion increase from year-end 2007,prima-

rily reflecting the addition of loans acquired in the Washington

Mutual transaction.
Prime mortgages of $72.5 billion increased $31.9 billion fromDecember 2007 as a result of loans acquired in the Washington

Mutual transaction and,to a lesser extent,additional originations

into the portfolio.The 2008 provision for credit losses includes a net

increase of $1.1 billion to the allowance for loan losses for the her-

itage JPMorgan Chase portfolio as a result of the economic environ-
ment noted above.The Firm estimates that loans with effective LTVs

in excess of 100% represented approximately 18% of the prime

mortgage portfolio.The Firm has tightened underwriting standards

for nonconforming prime mortgages in recent quarters,including

eliminating stated income products,reducing LTV maximums,and

eliminating the broker origination channel.
Subprime mortgages of $15.3 billion,excluding purchased credit-
impaired loans,decreased slightly from December 31,2007,as the

discontinuation of new originations was predominantly offset by

loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.The year-to-

date provision for credit losses includes a net increase of $1.4 billion
to the allowance for loan losses for the heritage JPMorgan Chase

portfolio as a result of the economic environment noted above.The

Firm estimates that loans with effective LTVs in excess of 100% rep-

resented approximately 27% of the subprime mortgage portfolio.
Option ARMs of $9.0 billion,excluding purchased credit-impaired
loans,were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.New

originations of option ARMs were discontinued by Washington

106JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Mutual prior to the date of the Washington Mutual transaction.This
portfolio is primarily comprised of loans with low LTVs and high bor-

rower FICOs and for which the Firm currently expects substantially
lower losses in comparison with the purchased credit-impaired port-
folio.The Firm has not,and does not,originate option ARMs.
Option ARMs are adjustable-rate mortgage products that provide the
borrower with the option to make a fully amortizing,interest-only,or

minimum payment.The minimum payment is based upon the interest

rate charged during the introductory period.This introductory rate is

typically well below the fully indexed rate.The fully indexed rate is

calculated using an index rate plus a margin.Once the introductory

period ends,the contractual interest rate charged on the loan

increases to the fully indexed rate.If the borrower continues to make

the minimum monthly payment after the introductory period ends,

the payment may not be sufficient to cover interest accrued in the
previous month.In this case,the loan will ﬁnegatively amortizeﬂas

unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan.Option ARMs typically become fully amortizing loans upon

reaching a negative amortization cap or on dates specified in the
borrowing agreement,at which time the required monthly payment

generally increases substantially.
Auto loans:As of December 31,2008,auto loans of $42.6 billion
increased slightly from year-end 2007.The allowance for loan losses

for the auto loan portfolio was increased during 2008,reflecting an

increase in estimated losses due to an increase in loss severity and
further deterioration of older vintage loans as a result of the worsen-

ing credit environment and declines in auto resale values.The auto

loan portfolio reflects a high concentration of prime quality credits.In

response to recent increases in loan delinquencies and credit losses,

particularly in MSAs experiencing the greatest housing price depreci-
ation and highest unemployment,credit underwriting criteria have

been tightened,which has resulted in the reduction of both extend-

ed-term and high loan-to-value financing.
Credit card:
JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,which includes credit card receivables on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets and those receivables sold to investors

through securitization.Managed credit card receivables were

$190.3 billion at December 31,2008,an increase of $33.3 billion

from year-end 2007,reflecting the acquisition of credit card loans

as part of the Washington Mutual transaction,as well as organic

growth in the portfolio.
The managed credit card net charge-off rate increased to 5.01% for
2008 from 3.68% in 2007.This increase was due primarily to higher

charge-offs as a result of the current economic environment,espe-

cially in areas experiencing the greatest housing price depreciation
and highest unemployment.The 30-day managed delinquency rate

increased to 4.97% at December 31,2008,from 3.48% at
December 31,2007,partially as a result of the addition of credit card
loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.Excluding the

Washington Mutual portfolio,the 30-day managed delinquency rate

was 4.36%.The Allowance for loan losses was increased due to high-

er estimated net charge-offs in the portfolio.As a result of continued

weakness in housing markets,account acquisition credit criteria and

account management credit practices have been tightened,particular-

ly in MSAs experiencing significant home price declines.The managed

credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned,largely

rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S.geographic diversification.
All other loans:All other loans primarily include business bankingloans (which are highly collateralized loans,often with personal loan

guarantees),student loans,and other secured and unsecured con-

sumer loans.As of December 31,2008,other loans,including loans

held-for-sale,of $35.5 billion were up $6.8 billion from year-end

2007,primarily as a result of organic growth in business banking

loans and student loans,as well as an increase in business banking

loans as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction.
Purchased credit-impaired loans:
Purchased credit-impairedloans of $88.8 billion in the home lending portfolio represent loans
acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction that were recorded at

fair value at the time of acquisition under SOP 03-3.The fair value of

these loans includes an estimate of losses that are expected to be
incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loans,and there-

fore no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans as of

the transaction date.Through year-end 2008,the credit performance

of these loans has generally been consistent with the assumptions

used in determining the initial fair value of these loans,and the

Firm™s original expectations regarding the amounts and timing of

future cash flows has not changed.A probable decrease in manage-

ment™s expectation of future cash collections related to these loans

could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses

related to these loans in the future.A significant and probable

increase in expected cash flows would generally result in an increase

in interest income recognized over the remaining life of the underly-
ing pool of loans.
Other real estate owned:
As part of the residential real estate
foreclosure process,loans are written down to net realizable value

less a cost to sell the asset.In those instances where the Firm gains

title,ownership and possession of individual properties at the com-

pletion of the foreclosure process,these Other Real Estate Owned

(OREO) assets are managed for prompt sale and disposition at the
best possible economic value.Any further gain or loss on sale of the

disposition of OREO assets are recorded as part of other income.

JPMorgan Chase™s allowance for credit losses is intended to cover
probable credit losses,including losses where the asset is not specifi-

cally identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.
At least quarterly,the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the

Chief Executive Officer,the Chief Risk Officer,the Chief Financial

Officer and the Controller of the Firm,and discussed with the Risk

Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm.

The allowance is reviewed relative to the risk profile of the Firm™s

credit portfolio and current economic conditions and is adjusted if,
in management™s judgment,changes are warranted.The allowance
includes an asset-specific and a formula-based component.For further

discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses,see

Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 119Œ123

and Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this Annual Report.At December

31,2008,management deemed the allowance for credit losses to be

appropriate (i.e.,sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the

portfolio,including losses that are not specifically identified or for

which the size of the loss has not yet been fully determined).www.global-reports.com

Management’s discussion and analysis
110JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
The allowance for credit losses increased $13.7 billion from the prior
year to $23.8 billion.The increase included $4.1 billion of allowance

related to noncredit-impaired loans acquired in the Washington

Mutual transaction and the related accounting conformity provision.

Excluding held-for-sale loans,loans carried at fair value,and pur-

chased credit-impaired consumer loans,the allowance for loan losses

represented 3.62% of loans at December 31,2008,compared with

1.88% at December 31,2007.
The consumer allowance for loan losses increased $10.5 billion from
the prior year as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction and

increased allowance for loan loss in residential real estate and credit

card.The increase included additions to the allowance for loan losses

of $4.7 billion driven by higher estimated losses for residential mort-
gage and home equity loans as the weak labor market and weak

overall economic conditions have resulted in increased delinquencies,

while continued weak housing prices have driven a significant
increase in loss severity.The allowance for loan losses related to

credit card increased $4.3 billion from the prior year primarily due to
the acquired allowance and subsequent conforming provision for

loan loss related to the Washington Mutual Bank acquisition and an

increase in provision for loan losses of $2.3 billion in 2008 over2007,as higher estimated net charge-offs are expected in the port-
folio resulting from the current economic conditions.
The wholesale allowance for loan losses increase of $3.4 billion from
December 31,2007,reflected the effect of a weakening credit envi-

ronment and the transfer of $4.9 billion of funded and unfunded

leveraged lending commitments to retained loans from held-for-sale.
To provide for the risk of loss inherent in the Firm™s process of
extending credit,an allowance for lending-related commitments is

held for both wholesale and consumer,which is reported in other lia-

bilities.The wholesale component is computed using a methodology

similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio,modified for

expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown and has an asset-

specific component and a formula-based component.For a further

discussion on the allowance for lending-related commitment see

Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this Annual Report.The allowance for

lending-related commitments for both wholesale and consumer was

$659 million and $850 million at December 31,2008 and 2007,

respectively.The decrease reflects the reduction in lending-related

commitments at December 31,2008.For more information,see page

102 of this Annual Report.

111MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT                
Market risk is the exposure to an adverse change in the market value
of portfolios and financial instruments caused by a change in market

prices or rates.
Market risk management 
Market risk is identified,measured,monitored,and controlled by

Market Risk,a corporate risk governance function independent of the

lines of business.Market Risk seeks to facilitate efficient risk/return

decisions,reduce volatility in operating performance and make the

Firm™s market risk profile transparent to senior management,the

Board of Directors and regulators.Market Risk is overseen by the

Chief Risk Officer and performs the following functions:†Establishment of a comprehensive market risk policy framework 
†Independent measurement,monitoring and control of business
segment market risk 
†Definition,approval and monitoring of limits 

†Performance of stress testing and qualitative risk assessments 
Risk identification and classification Market Risk works in partnership with the business segments to

identify market risks throughout the Firm and define and monitor

market risk policies and procedures.All business segments are
responsible for the comprehensive identification and verification ofmarket risks within their units.Risk-taking businesses have functions

that act independently from trading personnel and are responsible

for verifying risk exposures that the business takes.In addition to

providing independent oversight for market risk arising from the

business segments,Market Risk is also responsible for identifying

exposures which may not be large within individual business seg-
ments but which may be large for the Firm in the aggregate.Regular

meetings are held between Market Risk and the heads of risk-taking

businesses to discuss and decide on risk exposures in the context of
the market environment and client flows.
Positions that expose the Firm to market risk can be classified into
two categories:trading and nontrading risk.Trading risk includes posi-

tions that are held by the Firm as part of a business segment or unit,
the main business strategy of which is to trade or make markets.

Unrealized gains and losses in these positions are generally reported

in principal transactions revenue.Nontrading risk includes securities

and other assets held for longer-term investment,mortgage servicing

rights,and securities and derivatives used to manage the Firm™s

asset/liability exposures.Unrealized gains and losses in these posi-

tions are generally not reported in principal transactions revenue.
Provision for credit losses
The managed provision for credit losses includes amounts related to credit card securitizations.For the year ended December 31,
2008,the
increase in the provision for credit losses was due to year-over-year increase in the allowance for credit losses largely relat
ed to the home equity,
subprime mortgage,prime mortgage and credit card loan portfolios in the consumer businesses as well as in the allowance for cre
dit losses relatedto the wholesale portfolio.The increase in the allowance for credit losses related to the wholesale provision for loan losses f
rom the prior year
was due to the weakening credit environment,loan growth and the transfer of $4.9 billion of funded and unfunded leveraged lendi
ng commit-ments to retained loans from held-for-sale.The decrease in provision for lending-related commitments from the prior year benefi
ted from reduced
balances of lending-related commitments.

.(d)In November 2008,the Firm transferred $5.8 billion of higher quality credit card loans from the legacy Chase portfolio to a 
securitization trust previously established by Washington
Mutual (ﬁthe Trustﬂ).As a result of converting higher credit quality Chase-originated on-book receivables to the Trust's seller
's interest which has a higher overall loss rate reflective of
the total assets within the Trust,approximately $400 million of incremental provision expense was recorded during the fourth qu
arter.This incremental provision expense was recorded
in the Corporate segment as the action related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations.For further discuss
ion of credit card securitizations,see Note 16 on
pages 180Œ188 of this Annual Report.
Management’s discussion and analysis
112JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Trading risk 
The Firm makes markets and trades its products across several differ-

ent asset classes.These asset classes include primarily fixed income

(which includes interest rate risk and credit spread risk),foreign

exchange,equities and commodities.Trading risk arises from posi-

tions in these asset classes and may lead to the potential decline in
net income (i.e.,economic sensitivity) due to adverse changes in

market rates,whether arising from client activities or proprietary

positions taken by the Firm.
Nontrading risk 
Nontrading risk arises from execution of the Firm™s core business

strategies,the delivery of products and services to its customers,and

the positions the Firm undertakes to risk-manage its exposures.
These exposures can result from a variety of factors,including differ-
ences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets,liabili-

ties and off-balance sheet instruments.Changes in the level and

shape of market interest rate curves also may create interest rate

risk,since the repricing characteristics of the Firm™s assets do not

necessarily match those of its liabilities.The Firm is also exposed to

basis risk,which is the difference in the repricing characteristics of

two floating-rate indices,such as the prime rate and 3-month LIBOR.

In addition,some of the Firm™s products have embedded optionality

that impact pricing and balances.
The Firm™s mortgage banking activities give rise to complex interest
rate risks,as well as option and basis risk.Option risk arises primarily

from prepayment options embedded in mortgages and changes in
the probability of newly originated mortgage commitments actually
closing.Basis risk results from different relative movements between

mortgage rates and other interest rates.
Risk measurement 
Tools used to measure risk 

Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk,the

Firm uses various metrics,both statistical and nonstatistical,including:
†Nonstatistical risk measures 
†Value-at-risk (ﬁVaRﬂ) 

†Loss advisories 

†Drawdowns 

†Economic value stress testing 

†Earnings-at-risk stress testing 

†Risk identification for large exposures (ﬁRIFLEﬂ) 
Nonstatistical risk measures
Nonstatistical risk measures other than stress testing include net

open positions,basis point values,option sensitivities,market values,

position concentrations and position turnover.These measures pro-

vide granular information on the Firm™s market risk exposure.They

are aggregated by line of business and by risk type,and are used for

monitoring limits,one-off approvals and tactical control.
Value-at-risk (ﬁVaRﬂ)
JPMorgan Chase™s primary statistical risk measure,VaR,estimates the

potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market envi-

ronment and provides a consistent cross-business measure of risk
profiles and levels of diversification.VaR is used for comparing risks

across businesses,monitoring limits,and as an input to economic cap-

ital calculations.VaR provides risk transparency in a normal trading

environment.Each business day the Firm undertakes a comprehensive

VaR calculation that includes both its trading and its nontrading risks.

VaR for nontrading risk measures the amount of potential change in

the fair values of the exposures related to these risks;however,for

such risks,VaR is not a measure of reported revenue since nontrading

activities are generally not marked to market through net income.

Hedges of nontrading activities may be included in trading VaR since

they are marked to market.
To calculate VaR,the Firm uses historical simulation,based on a one-
day time horizon and an expected tail-loss methodology,which

measures risk across instruments and portfolios in a consistent and
comparable way.The simulation is based upon data for the previous

12 months.This approach assumes that historical changes in market

values are representative of future changes;this is an assumption

that may not always be accurate,particularly given the volatility in

the current market environment.For certain products,an actual price

time series is not available.In such cases,the historical simulation is

done using a proxy time series to estimate the risk.It is likely that

using an actual price time series for these products,if available,

would impact the VaR results presented.In addition,certain risk

parameters,such as correlation risk among certain IB trading instru-

ments,are not fully captured in VaR.
In the third quarter of 2008,the Firm revised its VaR measurement to
include additional risk positions previously excluded from VaR,thus

creating,in the Firm™s view,a more comprehensive view of its market

risks.In addition,the Firm moved to calculating VaR using a 95%

confidence level to provide a more stable measure of the VaR for

day-to-day risk management.The following sections describe

JPMorgan Chase™s VaR measures under both the legacy 99% confi-

dence level as well as the new 95% confidence level.The Firm

intends to solely present the VaR at the 95% confidence level once

information for two complete year-to-date periods is available.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
113Trading VaR includes substantially all trading activities in IB.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008,the credit spread sensitivi-

ties of certain mortgage products were included in trading VaR.This

change had an insignificant net impact on the average fourth quarter

2008 VaR.However,trading VaR does not include:held-for-sale fund-

ed loan and unfunded commitments positions (however,it does

include hedges of those positions);the debit valuation adjustments

(ﬁDVAﬂ) taken on derivative and structured liabilities to reflect the

credit quality of the Firm;the MSR portfolio;and securities and

instruments held by corporate functions,such as Corporate/Private

Equity.See the DVA Sensitivity table on page 115 of this Annual

Report for further details.For a discussion of MSRs and the corporate

functions,see Note 4 on pages 141Œ155,Note 18 on pages

198Œ201 and Corporate/ Private Equity on pages 73Œ75 of this

Annual Report.2008 VaR resultsIB™s average total trading and credit portfolio VaR was $202 million

for 2008,compared with $106 million for 2007,and includes the

positions from the Bear Stearns merger since May 31,2008.The

increase in average and maximum VaR during 2008 compared with

the prior year was primarily due to increased volatility across virtually

all asset classes.In addition,increased hedges of positions not

specifically captured in VaR Œ for example,macro hedge strategies

that have been deployed to mitigate the consequences of a systemic
risk event and hedges of loans held-for-sale Œ significantly increased

the VaR compared with the prior period.
For 2008,compared with the prior year,average trading VaR diversi-
fication increased to $108 million from $77 million,reflecting the

impact of the Bear Stearns merger.In general,over the course of the

year,VaR exposures can vary significantly as positions change,market

volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.
VaR backtestingTo evaluate the soundness of its VaR model,the Firm conducts daily

back-testing of VaR against daily IB market risk-related revenue,

which is defined as the change in value of principal transactions rev-

enue (less Private Equity gains/losses) plus any trading-related net

interest income,brokerage commissions,underwriting fees or other

revenue.The daily IB market risk-related revenue excludes gains and

losses on held-for-sale funded loans and unfunded commitments and

from DVA.The following histogram illustrates the daily market risk-

related gains and losses for IB trading businesses for the year ended

2008.The chart shows that IB posted market risk-related gains on

165 of the 262 days in this period,with 54 days exceeding $120

million.The inset graph looks at those days on which IB experienced

losses and depicts the amount by which 99% confidence level VaR

exceeded the actual loss on each of those days.During the year

ended December 31,2008,losses were sustained on 97 days;losses

exceeded the VaR measure on three of those days compared with

eight days for the year ended 2007.The Firm would expect to incur

losses greater than those predicted by the 99% confidence level VaR

estimates once in every 100 trading days,or about two to three

times a year.

(b) Average and period-end VaRs were less than the sum of the VaRs of its market risk components,which is due to risk offsets r
esulting from portfolio diversification.The diversification
effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.The risk of a portfolio of positions is therefore usually
 less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves.

sensitivities of certain mortgage products).The Firm utilizes proxies
to estimate the VaR for these mortgage and credit products since
daily time series are largely not available.In addition,the new VaR

115measure.In the Firm™s view,including these items in VaR produces a
more complete perspective of the Firm™s risk profile for items with

market risk that can impact the income statement.The Consumer

Lending VaR includes the Firm™s mortgage pipeline and warehouse

loans,MSRs and all related hedges.
The revised VaR measure continues to exclude the DVA taken on
derivative and structured liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the

Firm.It also excludes certain nontrading activity such as Private

Equity,principal investing (e.g.,mezzanine financing,tax-oriented

investments,etc.) and Corporate balance sheet and capital manage-

ment positions,as well as longer-term corporate investments.

Corporate positions are managed through the Firm™s earnings-at-risk

and other cash flow monitoring processes rather than by using a VaR

measure.Nontrading principal investing activities and Private Equity

positions are managed using stress and scenario analyses.
Changing to the 95% confidence interval caused the average VaR to
drop by $85 million in the third quarter when the new measure was

implemented.Under the 95% confidence interval,the Firm would

expect to incur daily losses greater than those predicted by VaR esti-

mates about twelve times a year.
The following table provides information about the sensitivity of DVA
to a one basis point increase in JPMorgan Chase™s credit spreads.The

sensitivity of DVA at December 31,2008,represents the Firm (includ-

ing Bear Stearns),while the sensitivity of DVA for December 31,

2007,represents heritage JPMorgan Chase only.

Loss advisories and drawdowns
Loss advisories and drawdowns are tools used to highlight to senior

management trading losses above certain levels and initiate discus-

sion of remedies.
Economic value stress testing   
While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in normal

markets,stress testing captures the Firm™s exposure to unlikely but

plausible events in abnormal markets.The Firm conducts economic

value stress tests for both its trading and nontrading activities at

least every two weeks using multiple scenarios that assume credit
spreads widen significantly,equity prices decline and interest rates

rise in the major currencies.Additional scenarios focus on the risks

predominant in individual business segments and include scenarios
that focus on the potential for adverse moves in complex portfolios.

Periodically,scenarios are reviewed and updated to reflect changes in

the Firm™s risk profile and economic events.Along with VaR,stress

testing is important in measuring and controlling risk.Stress testing

enhances the understanding of the Firm™s risk profile and loss poten-

tial,and stress losses are monitored against limits.Stress testing is

also utilized in one-off approvals and cross-business risk measure-

ment,as well as an input to economic capital allocation.Stress-test
results,trends and explanations are provided at least every two
weeks to the Firm™s senior management and to the lines of business

to help them better measure and manage risks and understand

event risk-sensitive positions.
Earnings-at-risk stress testing
The VaR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total

economic sensitivity of the Firm™s balance sheet to changes in market

variables.The effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income

is also important.Interest rate risk exposure in the Firm™s core non-

trading business activities (i.e.,asset/liability management positions)

results from on- and off-balance sheet positions and can occur due
to a variety of factors,including:
†Differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of
assets,liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments.For example,

if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates

are declining,earnings will increase initially.
†Differences in the amounts of assets,liabilities and off-balance
sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time.For exam-

ple,if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when gen-

eral interest rates are declining,earnings will increase initially.
†Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term
market interest rates change.For example,changes in the slope

of the yield curve because the Firm has the ability to lend at
long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short-term fixed

rates.Based upon these scenarios,the Firm™s earnings would be

affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in
short-term rates paid on its liabilities (e.g.,deposits) without a

corresponding increase in long-term rates received on its assets

(e.g.,loans).Conversely,higher long-term rates received on

assets generally are beneficial to earnings,particularly when the

increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on

liabilities.
†The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets,liabilities
or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change.For

example,if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher rate

loan balances when general interest rates are declining,earnings

may decrease initially.
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and lia-
bilities on a consolidated,corporate-wide basis.Business units trans-

fer their interest rate risk to Treasury through a transfer-pricing sys-

tem,which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure

that can be risk-managed in financial markets.These elements

include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest,

contractual principal payment schedules,expected prepayment expe-

rience,interest rate reset dates and maturities,rate indices used for

re-pricing,and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate

products.All transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.
The Firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income
from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenar-

ios.Earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the Firm™s

net interest income,and the corresponding impact to the Firm™s pre-

tax earnings,over the following 12 months.These tests highlight
exposures to various rate-sensitive factors,such as the rates them-

selves (e.g.,the prime lending rate),pricing strategies on deposits,

optionality and changes in product mix.The tests include forecasted

balance sheet changes,such as asset sales and securitizations,as

well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior.
Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk,
and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed.These

scenarios include the implied forward curve,nonparallel rate shifts

and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates.These scenarios

are intended to provide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase™s

earnings-at-risk over a wide range of outcomes.
JPMorgan Chase™s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of
December 31,2008 and 2007,is as follows.
Immediate change in rates
(in millions)+200bp+100bp-100bp-200bp

(a) Down 100 and 200 basis point parallel shocks result in a Fed Funds target rate of
zero,and negative three- and six-month Treasury rates.The earnings-at-risk results of

such a low probability scenario are not meaningful (ﬁNMﬂ).The change in earnings-at-risk from December 31,2007,results from
a higher level of AFS securities and lower market interest rates.The

benefit to the Firm of an increase in rates results from a widening of

deposit margins which are currently compressed due to very low
short-term interest rates.This benefit would be partially offset by the

effect of reduced mortgage prepayments.The impact to the Firm™s

pretax earnings of reduced mortgage prepayments would become
more pronounced under a +200 bp parallel shock.
Additionally,another sensitivity involving a steeper yield curve,with
long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short-term rates staying

at current levels,results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of

$740 million.The increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of

maturing assets at the higher long-term rates with funding costs

remaining unchanged.Risk identification for large exposures (ﬁRIFLEﬂ)
Individuals who manage risk positions,particularly those that are

complex,are responsible for identifying potential losses that could

arise from specific,unusual events,such as a potential tax change,

and estimating the probabilities of losses arising from such events.

This information is entered into the Firm™s RIFLE database.

Management of trading businesses control RIFLE entries,thereby per-

mitting the Firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not ade-

quately covered by standard risk measures.
Risk monitoring and control
Limits
Market risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits.Limits

reflect the Firm™s risk appetite in the context of the market environ-

ment and business strategy.In setting limits,the Firm takes into con-

sideration factors such as market volatility,product liquidity,business

trends and management experience.
Market risk management regularly reviews and updates risk limits.
Senior management,including the Firm™s Chief Executive Officer and

Chief Risk Officer,is responsible for reviewing and approving risk lim-

its at least once a year.
The Firm maintains different levels of limits.Corporate-level limits
include VaR and stress limits.Similarly,line-of-business limits include

VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by loss advisories,

nonstatistical measurements and instrument authorities.Businesses

are responsible for adhering to established limits,against which

exposures are monitored and reported.Limit breaches are reported

in a timely manner to senior management,and the affected business

segment is required to reduce trading positions or consult with sen-

ior management on the appropriate action.Qualitative review
The Market Risk Management group also performs periodic reviews

as necessary of both businesses and products with exposure to mar-
ket risk to assess the ability of the businesses to control their market

risk.Strategies,market conditions,product details and risk controls

are reviewed,and specific recommendations for improvements are

made to management.Model review
Some of the Firm™s financial instruments cannot be valued based

upon quoted market prices but are instead valued using pricing mod-

els.Such models are used for management of risk positions,such as

reporting against limits,as well as for valuation.The Model Risk

Group,independent of the businesses and market risk management,

reviews the models the Firm uses and assesses model appropriate-

ness and consistency.The model reviews consider a number of fac-

tors about the model™s suitability for valuation and risk management

of a particular product,including whether it accurately reflects the

characteristics of the transaction and its significant risks,the suitabili-

ty and convergence properties of numerical algorithms,reliability of

data sources,consistency of the treatment with models for similar

products,and sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions that

cannot be priced from the market.
Reviews are conducted of new or changed models,as well as previ-
ously accepted models,to assess whether there have been any

changes in the product or market that may impact the model™s validity

and whether there are theoretical or competitive developments that

may require reassessment of the model™s adequacy.For a summary of

valuations based upon models,see Critical Accounting Estimates Used

by the Firm on pages 119Œ123 of this Annual Report.
Risk reporting
Nonstatistical exposures,value-at-risk,loss advisories and limit

excesses are reported daily for each trading and nontrading business.

Market risk exposure trends,value-at-risk trends,profit and loss

changes,and portfolio concentrations are reported weekly.Stress-

test results are reported at least every two weeks to business and
senior management.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
117Risk managementThe Firm makes direct principal investments in private equity.The

illiquid nature and long-term holding period associated with these
investments differentiates private equity risk from the risk of posi-

tions held in the trading portfolios.The Firm™s approach to managing

private equity risk is consistent with the Firm™s general risk gover-

nance structure.Controls are in place establishing expected levels for

total and annual investment in order to control the overall size of the

portfolio.Industry and geographic concentration limits are in place

and intended to ensure diversification of the portfolio.All invest-
ments are approved by an investment committee that includes exec-utives who are not part of the investing businesses.An independent

valuation function is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of

the carrying values of private equity investments in accordance with

relevant accounting policies.At December 31,2008 and 2007,the

carrying value of the private equity businesses was $6.9 billion and

$7.2 billion,respectively,of which $483 million and $390 million,

respectively,represented publicly traded positions.For further infor-

mation on the Private equity portfolio,see page 75 of this Annual

Report.PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT        
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT   
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed

processes or systems,human factors or external events.
OverviewOperational risk is inherent in each of the Firm™s businesses and sup-

port activities.Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways,

including errors,fraudulent acts,business interruptions,inappropriate

behavior of employees,or vendors that do not perform in accordance

with their arrangements.These events could result in financial losses

and other damage to the Firm,including reputational harm.
To monitor and control operational risk,the Firm maintains a system
of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to pro-

vide a sound and well-controlled operational environment.The goal

is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels,in light of the Firm™s

financial strength,the characteristics of its businesses,the markets in

which it operates,and the competitive and regulatory environment to

which it is subject.Notwithstanding these control measures,the Firm

incurs operational losses.
The Firm™s approach to operational risk management is intended to
mitigate such losses by supplementing traditional control-based

approaches to operational risk with risk measures,tools and disci-

plines that are risk-specific,consistently applied and utilized

firmwide.Key themes are transparency of information,escalation of

key issues and accountability for issue resolution.
The Firm™s operational risk framework is supported by Phoenix,an
internally designed operational risk software tool.Phoenix integrates

the individual components of the operational risk management

framework into a unified,web-based tool.Phoenix enhances the

capture,reporting and analysis of operational risk data by enabling

risk identification,measurement,monitoring,reporting and analysis

to be done in an integrated manner,thereby enabling efficiencies in

the Firm™s monitoring and management of its operational risk.
For purposes of identification,monitoring,reporting and analysis,the
Firm categorizes operational risk events as follows:
†  Client service and selection
†  Business practices

†  Fraud,theft and malice

†  Execution,delivery and process management

†  Employee disputes

†  Disasters and public safety

†  Technology and infrastructure failures
Risk identification and measurement
Risk identification is the recognition of the operational risk events

that management believes may give rise to operational losses.All

businesses utilize the Firm™s standard self-assessment process and

supporting architecture as a dynamic risk management tool.The goal

of the self-assessment process is for each business to identify the key

operational risks specific to its environment and assess the degree to

which it maintains appropriate controls.Action plans are developed

for control issues identified,and businesses are held accountable for

tracking and resolving these issues on a timely basis.
Risk monitoringThe Firm has a process for monitoring operational risk-event data,

permitting analysis of errors and losses as well as trends.Such analy-

sis,performed both at a line-of-business level and by risk-event type,

enables identification of the causes associated with risk events faced
by the businesses.Where available,the internal data can be supple-

mented with external data for comparative analysis with industry

patterns.The data reported enables the Firm to back-test against

self-assessment results.The Firm is a founding member of the

Operational Riskdata eXchange Association,a not-for-profit industry

association formed for the purpose of collecting operational loss

data,sharing data in an anonymous form and benchmarking results

back to members.Such information supplements the Firm™s ongoing

operational risk measurement and analysis.
Management’s discussion and analysis
118JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Risk reporting and analysis
Operational risk management reports provide timely and accurate

information,including information about actual operational loss lev-

els and self-assessment results,to the lines of business and senior

management.The purpose of these reports is to enable management

to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels within each line of

business,to escalate issues and to provide consistent data aggrega-

tion across the Firm™s businesses and support areas.
Audit alignment Internal Audit utilizes a risk-based program of audit coverage to pro-

vide an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of
key controls over the Firm™s operations,regulatory compliance and

reporting.This includes reviewing the operational risk framework,the

effectiveness and accuracy of the business self-assessment process

and the loss data collection and reporting activities.
REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENT          
A firm™s success depends not only on its prudent management of the

liquidity,credit,market and operational risks that are part of its busi-

ness risks,but equally on the maintenance among many constituents

Œ clients,investors,regulators,as well as the general public Œ of a

reputation for business practices of the highest quality.Attention to

reputation always has been a key aspect of the Firm™s practices,and

maintenance of the Firm™s reputation is the responsibility of everyone

at the Firm.JPMorgan Chase bolsters this individual responsibility in

many ways,including through the Firm™s Code of Conduct,training,

maintaining adherence to policies and procedures,and oversight

functions that approve transactions.These oversight functions include

a Conflicts Office,which examines wholesale transactions with the

potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm,and regional rep-

utation risk review committees,which review certain transactions

with clients,especially complex derivatives and structured finance

transactions,that have the potential to affect adversely the Firm™s

reputation.These regional committees,whose members are senior

representatives of businesses and control functions in the region,
focus on the purpose and effect of the transactions from the client™s

point of view,with the goal that these transactions are not used to

mislead investors or others.
Fiduciary risk managementThe risk management committees within each line of business

include in their mandate the oversight of the legal,reputational and,

where appropriate,fiduciary risks in their businesses that may pro-

duce significant losses or reputational damage.The Fiduciary Risk

Management function works with the relevant line-of-business risk

committees with the goal of ensuring that businesses providing
investment or risk management products or services that give rise to
fiduciary duties to clients perform at the appropriate standard rela-

tive to their fiduciary relationship with a client.Of particular focus

are the policies and practices that address a business™ responsibilities

to a client,including client suitability determination;disclosure obli-

gations and communications;and performance expectations with

respect to risk management products or services being provided.In

this way,the relevant line-of-business risk committees,together with

the Fiduciary Risk Management function,provide oversight of the

Firm™s efforts to monitor,measure and control the risks that may

arise in the delivery of the products or services to clients that give
rise to such fiduciary duties,as well as those stemming from any of

the Firm™s fiduciary responsibilities to employees under the Firm™s var-

ious employee benefit plans.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
119JPMorgan Chase™s accounting policies and use of estimates are inte-
gral to understanding its reported results.The Firm™s most complex

accounting estimates require management™s judgment to ascertain

the value of assets and liabilities.The Firm has established detailed

policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation

methods,including any judgments made as part of such methods,

are well-controlled,independently reviewed and applied consistently

from period to period.In addition,the policies and procedures are

intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies
occurs in an appropriate manner.The Firm believes its estimates for

determining the value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.The

following is a brief description of the Firm™s critical accounting esti-

mates involving significant valuation judgments.
Allowance for credit losses 
JPMorgan Chase™s allowance for credit losses covers the wholesale

and consumer loan portfolios,as well as the Firm™s portfolio of lend-

ing-related commitments.The allowance for credit losses is intended

to adjust the value of the Firm™s loan assets for probable credit losses

as of the balance sheet date.For further discussion of the method-

ologies used in establishing the Firm™s allowance for credit losses,

see Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this Annual Report.
Wholesale loans and lending-related commitments The methodology for calculating both the allowance for loan losses

and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves signifi-

cant judgment.First and foremost,it involves the early identification

of credits that are deteriorating.Second,it involves judgment in

establishing the inputs used to estimate the allowances.Third,it

involves management judgment to evaluate certain macroeconomic

factors,underwriting standards,and other relevant internal and

external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio
and to refine loss factors to better reflect these conditions.
The Firm uses a risk-rating system to determine the credit quality of
its wholesale loans.Wholesale loans are reviewed for information

affecting the obligor™s ability to fulfill its obligations.In assessing the

risk rating of a particular loan,among the factors considered are the

obligor™s debt capacity and financial flexibility,the level of the oblig-

or™s earnings,the amount and sources for repayment,the level and

nature of contingencies,management strength and the industry and

geography in which the obligor operates.These factors are based

upon an evaluation of historical and current information,and involve

subjective assessment and interpretation.Emphasizing one factor

over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk
rating assigned by the Firm to that loan.
The Firm applies its judgment to establish loss factors used in calcu-
lating the allowances.Wherever possible,the Firm uses independent,

verifiable data or the Firm™s own historical loss experience in its mod-

els for estimating the allowances.Many factors can affect estimates

of loss,including volatility of loss given default,probability of default

and rating migrations.Consideration is given as to whether the loss

estimates should be calculated as an average over the entire credit
cycle or at a particular point in the credit cycle,as well as to which
external data should be used and when they should be used.
Choosing data that are not reflective of the Firm™s specific loan port-

folio characteristics could also affect loss estimates.The application

of different inputs would change the amount of the allowance for

credit losses determined appropriate by the Firm.Management also applies its judgment to adjust the loss factorsderived,taking into consideration model imprecision,external factors

and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in
the loss factors by establishing ranges using historical experience of

both loss given default and probability of default.Factors related to

concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated

where relevant.These estimates are based upon management™s view

of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political
conditions,quality of underwriting standards and other relevant

internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current
portfolio.
As noted on page 96 of this Annual Report,the Firm™s wholesale
allowance is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to a loan.Assuming

a one-notch downgrade in the Firm™s internal risk ratings for its

entire wholesale portfolio,the allowance for loan losses for the

wholesale portfolio would increase by approximately $1.8 billion as

of December 31,2008.This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical.In the

Firm™s view,the likelihood of a one-notch downgrade for all whole-

sale loans within a short timeframe is remote.The purpose of this

analysis is to provide an indication of the impact of risk ratings on

the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans.It

is not intended to imply management™s expectation of future deterio-

ration in risk ratings.Given the process the Firm follows in determin-

ing the risk ratings of its loans,management believes the risk ratings

currently assigned to wholesale loans are appropriate.
Consumer loans and lending-related commitmentsThe allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio is sensitive

to changes in the economic environment,delinquency status,credit

bureau scores,the realizable value of collateral,borrower behavior

and other risk factors,and is intended to represent management's

best estimate of incurred losses as of the balance sheet date.The

credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire con-
sumer credit product spectrum continues to be negatively affected by

the economic environment,as the weak labor market and weak over-

all economic conditions have resulted in increased delinquencies,

while continued weak housing prices have driven a significant
increase in loss severity.Significant judgment is required to estimate

the duration and severity of the current economic downturn,as well

as its potential impact on housing prices and the labor market.While

the allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to both home prices

and unemployment rates,in the current market it is difficult to esti-

mate how potential changes in one or both of these factors might
impact the allowance for credit losses.For example,while both factors

are important determinants of overall allowance levels,changes in

one factor or the other may not occur at the same rate,or changes

may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factorCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
Management’s discussion and analysis
120JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
may offset deterioration in the other.In addition,changes in these
factors would not necessarily be consistent across geographies or

product types.Finally,it is difficult to predict the extent to which

changes in both or either of these factors will ultimately impact the
frequency of losses,the severity of losses,or both,and overall loss

rates are a function of both the frequency and severity of individual

loan losses.
The allowance is calculated by applying statistical loss factors and
other risk indicators to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics

to arrive at an estimate of incurred losses in the portfolio.

Management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for

each loan portfolio category using delinquency trends and other risk
characteristics to estimate charge-offs.Management utilizes addi-

tional statistical methods and considers portfolio and collateral valu-

ation trends to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical

loss estimate.
The statistical calculation is adjusted to take into consideration
model imprecision,external factors and current economic events that

have occurred but are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive
the statistical calculation,and is accomplished in part by analyzing

the historical loss experience for each major product segment.In the

current economic environment,it is difficult to predict whether his-

torical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels.Management

applies judgment within estimated ranges in determining this adjust-

ment,taking into account the numerous uncertainties inherent in the

current economic environment.The estimated ranges and the deter-

mination of the appropriate point within the range are based upon

management™s judgment related to uncertainties associated with cur-

rent macroeconomic and political conditions,quality of underwriting

standards,and other relevant internal and external factors affecting

the credit quality of the portfolio.
Fair value of financial instruments,MSRs and commodities
inventory 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of it assets and liabilities at fair
value.The majority of such assets and liabilities are carried at fair

value on a recurring basis.In addition,certain assets are carried at

fair value on a nonrecurring basis,including loans accounted for at

the lower of cost or fair value that are only subject to fair value

adjustments under certain circumstances.
On January 1,2007,the Firm adopted SFAS 157,which established a
three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measure-

ments.An instrument™s categorization within the hierarchy is based

upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value

measurement.Therefore,for instruments classified in levels 1 and 2

of the hierarchy,where inputs are principally based on observable

market data,there is less judgment applied in arriving at a fair value

measurement.For instruments classified within level 3 of the hierar-

chy,judgments are more significant.The Firm reviews and updates

the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis.Changes

from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to

a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification between

hierarchy levels.

121exchange rates and credit curves.In addition to market information,
models also incorporate transaction details,such as maturity.Finally,

management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate
level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,

the Firm's creditworthiness,constraints on liquidity and unobservable

parameters,where relevant.The judgments made are typically affect-

ed by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the

level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole.

ValuationFor instruments classified within level 3 of the hierarchy,judgments
may be significant.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an

instrument within level 3,management must first determine the

appropriate model to use.Second,due to the lack of observability of

significant inputs,management must assess all relevant empirical

data in deriving valuation inputs including but not limited to yield

curves,interest rates,volatilities,equity or debt prices,foreign
Management’s discussion and analysis
122JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can impact the
amount of revenue or loss recorded for a particular position.
Furthermore,while the Firm believes its valuation methods are

appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants,

the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the

fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different

estimate of fair value at the reporting date.For a detailed discussion

of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments,

see Note 4 on pages 141Œ145 of this Annual Report.In addition,for

a further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates
involved in the determination of the Firm™s mortgage-related expo-

sures,see ﬁMortgage-related exposures carried at fair valueﬂin Note

4 on pages 151Œ153 of this Annual Report.
Purchased credit-impaired loans
JPMorgan Chase acquired,in connection with the Washington Mutual

transaction,certain loans with evidence of deterioration of credit

quality since origination and for which it was probable,at acquisition,

that the Firm would be unable to collect all contractually required

payments receivable.These purchased credit-impaired loans are

accounted for in accordance with SOP 03-3.Many of the assumptions

and estimates underlying the application of SOP 03-3 are both signifi-
cant and judgmental,particularly considering the current economic

environment.The level of future home price declines,the duration and

severity of the current economic downturn and the lack of market liq-

uidity and transparency are factors that have impacted and may con-

tinue to impact these assumptions and estimates.
Determining which loans are included in the scope of SOP 03-3 ishighly subjective and requires the application of significant judgment.
In the Washington Mutual transaction,consumer loans with certain

attributes (e.g.,higher loan-to-value ratios,borrowers with lower FICO

scores,delinquencies) were determined to be credit-impaired,provid-

ed that those attributes arose subsequent to loan origination.
Wholesale loans were determined to be credit-impaired if they met
the definition of an impaired loan under SFAS 114 at the acquisition

date.Applying SOP 03-3 to the appropriate population of loans is

important because loans that are not within the scope of SOP 03-3
are subject to different accounting standards.Choosing different

attributes in making the management assessment of which loans
were credit-impaired and within the scope of SOP 03-3 could have
resulted in a different (i.e.,larger or smaller) population of loans

deemed credit-impaired at the transaction date.
Loans determined to be within the scope of SOP 03-3 are initiallyrecorded at fair value.The Firm has estimated the fair value of these

loans by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected at a
market observable discount rate,when available,adjusted for factors

that a market participant would consider in determining fair value.

The initial estimate of cash flows expected to be collected entails sig-

nificant management judgment,as such cash flows were derived from

assumptions such as default rates,loss severities and the amount and

timing of prepayments.Particularly in the current economic environ-

ment,estimating the initial fair value of these loans was highly sub-

jective.The application of different assumptions by management

would have resulted in different initial fair values.
The Firm has elected to aggregate the purchased credit-impaired con-
sumer loans into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating whether individual

loans have common risk characteristics for purposes of establishing

these pools.Each resulting pool is considered one loan with a com-

posite interest rate and estimation of cash flows expected to be col-

lected for purposes of applying SOP 03-3 subsequent to acquisition.
The process of estimating cash flows expected to be collected subse-

quent to acquisition is both subjective and judgmental and may have
an impact on the recognition and measurement of impairment losses
and/or interest income.In addition,the decision to pool these loans

and the manner in which they were pooled may have an impact on
the recognition,measurement and/or classification of interest income

and/or impairment losses.
Goodwill impairment Under SFAS 142,goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and

tested for impairment.SFAS 142 defines reporting units of an entity

as either SFAS 131 operating segments (i.e.,one level below the

SFAS 131 reportable segments as disclosed in Note 37 of this Annual

Report) or one level below the SFAS 131 operating segments.

JPMorgan Chase generally determined its reporting units to be one

level below the six major business segments identified in Note 37 on
pages 226Œ227 of this Annual Report,plus Private Equity which is

included in Corporate.This determination was based on how the

Firm™s operating segments are managed and how they are reviewed

by the Firm™s Operating Committee.
The Firm tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more fre-
quently if events or circumstances,such as adverse changes in the

business climate,indicate that there may be justification for conduct-

ing an interim test.The first part of the test is a comparison,at the

reporting unit level,of the fair value of each reporting unit to its car-

rying amount,including goodwill.If the fair value is less than the

carrying value,then the second part of the test is needed to measure

the amount of potential goodwill impairment.The implied fair value

of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared with the
carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the Firm™s financial records.

If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the

implied fair value of that goodwill,then the Firm would recognize an

impairment loss in the amount of the difference,which would be

recorded as a charge against net income.
If the fair value of the reporting unit in the first part of the test is
determined to be greater than the carrying amount of the reporting
unit including goodwill,then and in accordance with SFAS 142

goodwill is deemed not to be impaired.During the fourth quarter of

2008,the Firm performed its annual goodwill impairment testing

and concluded that the fair value of each of its reporting units was

in excess of their respective carrying values including goodwill.

Accordingly,the Firm concluded that its goodwill was not impaired

at December 31,2008.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
123The Firm considers discounted cash flow models to be its primary
method of determining the fair value of its reporting units.The mod-

els project levered cash flows for five years and use the perpetuity
growth method to calculate terminal values.The first year™s projected

cash flows are based on the reporting units™ internal budget fore-
casts for the upcoming calendar year (which are reviewed with the
Operating Committee of the Firm).To assess the reasonableness of

the valuations derived from the discounted cash flow models,the

Firm also analyzes market-based trading and transaction multiples,

where available.These trading and transaction comparables are used

to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair values,as observ-

able market information is generally not available.
JPMorgan Chase™s stock price,consistent with stock prices in the
broader financial services sector,declined significantly during the last

half of 2008.JPMorgan Chase™s market capitalization fell below its

recorded book value,principally during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Although the Firm believes it is reasonable to conclude that market

capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time,the Firm

is of the view that short-term fluctuations in market capitalization do

not reflect the long-term fair value of its reporting units.
Management applies significant judgment when determining the fairvalue of its reporting units.Imprecision in estimating the future cash

flows of the Firm™s reporting units as well as the appropriate cost of

equity used to discount those cash flows can impact their estimated
fair values.If JPMorgan Chase™s common stock were to trade at the

level it was at the end of 2008 over a sustained period and weak

economic market conditions persist,these factors could indicate that
the long-term earnings potential of the Firm™s reporting units could
be adversely affected Œ which could result in supplemental impair-
ment testing during interim reporting periods and possible impair-
ment of goodwill in the future.
Income taxesJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various juris-

dictions in which it operates,including U.S.federal,state and non-U.S.

jurisdictions.These laws are often complex and may be subject to dif-

ferent interpretations.To determine the financial statement impact of

its accounting for income taxes,including the provision for income tax

expense and its unrecognized tax benefits,JPMorgan Chase must

make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply

these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business

events.Disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authori-

ties may be settled upon audit or administrative appeals.In some

cases,the Firm™s interpretations of tax laws may be subject to adjudi-

cation by the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which it oper-
ates.JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether the Firm may be

assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these
matters,and the Firm records additional reserves as appropriate.
The Firm does not anticipate that current market events will adversely
impact the realizability of its deferred tax assets.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when
additional information becomes available.The reassessment of

JPMorgan Chase™s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material

impact on its effective tax rate in the period in which it occurs.
ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS
Derivatives netting Œ amendment of FASB Interpretation

No.39  

In April 2007,the FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1,which permits offset-

ting of cash collateral receivables or payables with net derivative

positions under certain circumstances.The Firm adopted FSP FIN 39-

1 effective January 1,2008.The FSP did not have a material impact

on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share-
based payment awards  

In June 2007,the FASB ratified EITF 06-11,which must be applied

prospectively for dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after
December 15,2007.EITF 06-11 requires that realized tax benefits

from dividends or dividend equivalents paid on equity-classified

share-based payment awards that are charged to retained earnings

be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and included
in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies

on share-based payment awards.Prior to the issuance of EITF 06-11,

the Firm did not include these tax benefits as part of this pool of
excess tax benefits.The Firm adopted EITF 06-11 on January 1,

2008.The adoption of this consensus did not have an impact on the

Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Fair value measurements Œ written loan commitments 
In November 2007,the SEC issued SAB 109,which revises and

rescinds portions of SAB 105.Specifically,SAB 109 states that the

expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of
the loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan
commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.

The provisions of SAB 109 are applicable to written loan commit-

ments issued or modified beginning on January 1,2008.The Firm

adopted SAB 109 on January 1,2008.The adoption of this pro-

nouncement did not have a material impact on the Firm™s

Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Business combinations/noncontrolling interests in consoli-
dated financial statements  
In December 2007,the FASB issued SFAS 141R and SFAS 160,which

amend the accounting and reporting of business combinations,as

well as noncontrolling (i.e.,minority) interests.For JPMorgan Chase,

SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations that close on or

after January 1,2009.SFAS 160 is effective for JPMorgan Chase for

fiscal years beginning on or after December 15,2008.
Management’s discussion and analysis
124JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
SFAS 141R will generally only impact the accounting for future busi-
ness combinations and will impact certain aspects of business combi-
nation accounting,such as transaction costs and certain merger-

related restructuring reserves,as well as the accounting for partial

acquisitions where control is obtained by JPMorgan Chase.One

exception to the prospective application of SFAS 141R relates to

accounting for income taxes associated with business combinations
that closed prior to January 1,2009.Once the purchase accounting

measurement period closes for these acquisitions,any further adjust-

ments to income taxes recorded as part of these business combina-
tions will impact income tax expense.Previously,further adjustments

were predominately recorded as adjustments to Goodwill.JPMorgan

Chase will continue to evaluate the impact that SFAS 141R will have

on its consolidated financial statements.
SFAS 160 requires that noncontrolling interests be accounted for and
presented as equity,rather than as a liability or mezzanine equity.

Changes to how the income statement is presented will also result.
SFAS 160 presentation and disclosure requirements are to be applied

retrospectively.The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected

to have a material impact on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets,

results of operations or ratios.
Accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase
financing transactions

In February 2008,the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-3,which requires an

initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing that

was entered into contemporaneously with,or in contemplation of,

the initial transfer to be evaluated together as a linked transaction

under SFAS 140,unless certain criteria are met.The Firm adopted

FSP FAS 140-3 on January 1,2009,for new transactions entered into

after the date of adoption.The adoption of FSP FAS 140-3 is not

expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets or results of operations.
Disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activ-
ities Œ FASB Statement No.161

In March 2008,the FASB issued SFAS 161,which amends the disclo-

sure requirements of SFAS 133.SFAS 161 requires increased disclo-

sures about derivative instruments and hedging activities and their

effects on an entity™s financial position,financial performance and

cash flows.SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after

November 15,2008,with early adoption permitted.SFAS 161 will

only affect JPMorgan Chase™s disclosures of derivative instruments

and related hedging activities,and not its Consolidated Balance

Sheets,Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated

Statements of Cash Flows.
Determining whether instruments granted in share-based
payment transactions are participating securities

In June 2008,the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1,which addresses

whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions

are participating securities prior to vesting and,therefore,need to be

included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share
under the two-class method.FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial

statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008,and interim periods within those years.Adoption of FSP EITF

03-6-1 does not affect net income or results of operations but may

result in a reduction of basic and/or diluted earnings per share in
certain periods.
Disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees
In September 2008,the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4.The

FSP requires enhanced disclosures about credit derivatives and guar-

antees to address the potential adverse effects of changes in credit
risk on the financial position,financial performance and cash flows

of the sellers of these instruments.The FSP is effective for reporting

periods ending after November 15,2008,with earlier application

permitted.The disclosures required by this FSP are incorporated in

this Annual Report.FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 only affects

JPMorgan Chase™s disclosures of credit derivatives and guarantees

and not its Consolidated Balance Sheets,
Consolidated Statements of
Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature)
is indexed to an entity™s own stock

In September 2008,the EITF issued EITF 07-5,which establishes a

two-step process for evaluating whether equity-linked financial

instruments and embedded features are indexed to a company™s own

stock for purposes of determining whether the derivative scope

exception in SFAS 133 should be applied.EITF 07-5 is effective for

fiscal years beginning after December 2008.The adoption of this

EITF is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm™s

Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Accounting for transfers of financial assets and consolida-
tion of variable interest entities

The FASB has been deliberating certain amendments to both SFAS

140 and FIN 46R that may impact the accounting for transactions

that involve QSPEs and VIEs.Among other things,the FASB is pro-

posing to eliminate the concept of QSPEs from both SFAS 140 and

FIN 46R and make key changes to the consolidation model of FIN

46R that will change the method of determining which party to a VIE

should consolidate the VIE.A final standard is expected to be issued

in the second quarter of 2009,with an 
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
125expected effective date in January 2010.Entities expected to be
impacted include revolving securitization entities,bank-administered

asset-backed commercial paper conduits,and certain mortgage secu-

ritization entities.The Firm is monitoring the FASB™s deliberations on

these proposed amendments and continues to evaluate their poten-

tial impact.The ultimate impact of the Firm will depend upon the

guidance issued by the FASB in a final statement amending SFAS

140 and FIN 46R.Determining the fair value of an asset when the market for
that asset is not active 
In October 2008,the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3,which clarifies the

application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides

an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair

value of a financial instrument when the market for that financial

asset is not active.The FSP was effective upon issuance,including

prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued.
The application of this FSP did not have an impact on the Firm™s

Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.
Disclosure about transfers of financial assets and interests
in VIEs
On December 11,2008,the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN

46(R)-8,which requires additional disclosures relating to transfers of

financial assets and interests in securitization entities and other vari-

able interest entities.The purpose of this FSP is to require improved

disclosure by public enterprises prior to the effective dates of the
proposed amendments to SFAS 140 and FIN 46(R).The effective date

for the FSP is for reporting periods (interim and annual) beginning
with the first reporting period that ends after December 15,2008.

The disclosures required by this FSP are incorporated in this Annual

Report.FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 only affects JPMorgan

Chase™s disclosure of transfers of financial assets and interests in

securitization entities and other variable interest entities and not its

Consolidated Balance Sheets,Consolidated Statements of Income or

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Employers™ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan
assets
In December 2008,the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1,which

requires more detailed disclosures about employers™ plan assets,

including investment strategies,major categories of plan assets,con-

centrations of risk within plan assets,and valuation techniques used

to measure the fair value of plan assets.This FSP is effective for fiscal

years ending after December 15,2009.The Firm intends to adopt

these additional disclosure requirements on the effective date.
Amendments to the impairment guidance of EITF Issue No.
99-20
In January 2009,the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1,which amends

the impairment guidance in EITF 99-20 to make the investment secu-

rity impairment model in EITF 99-20 more consistent with the securi-
ties impairment model in SFAS 115.FSP EITF 99-20-1 removes the

requirement that a holder™s best estimate of cash flows be based

exclusively upon those that a market participant would use and

allows for reasonable judgment to be applied in considering whether
an adverse change in cash flows has occurred based on all available

information relevant to the collectibility of the security.FSP EITF 99-

20-1 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
December 15,2008,and therefore the Firm has adopted FSP EITF

99-20-1 as of December 31,2008.The adoption of this FSP did not

have a material impact on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets or

results of operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
128JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
the Firm™s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,

2008.In making the assessment,management used the framework in

ﬁInternal Control Œ Integrated Frameworkﬂpromulgated by the

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,

commonly referred to as the ﬁCOSOﬂcriteria.
Based upon the assessment performed,management concluded that
as of December 31,2008,JPMorgan Chase™s internal control over

financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO criteria.

Additionally,based upon management™s assessment,the Firm deter-

mined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31,2008.
The effectiveness of the Firm™s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31,2008,has been audited by

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,an independent registered public

accounting firm,as stated in their report which appears herein.
James Dimon
Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMichael J.Cavanagh
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
February 27,2009
Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co.(ﬁJPMorgan Chaseﬂor the
ﬁFirmﬂ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting.Internal control over financial

reporting is a process designed by,or under the supervision of,the

Firm™s principal executive and principal financial officers,or persons

performing similar functions,and effected by JPMorgan Chase™s Board

of Directors,management and other personnel,to provide reasonable

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accor-

dance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United

States of America.
JPMorgan Chase™s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records,that,in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the

transactions and dispositions of the Firm™s assets;(2) provide reason-

able assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit

preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of

the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
JPMorgan Chase™s management and directors;and (3) provide rea-

sonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unau-

thorized acquisition,use or disposition of the Firm™s assets that could

have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations,internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also,projections

of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the

risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in con-

Report of independent registered public accounting firmA company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for

external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting

principles.A company™s internal control over financial reporting

includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the mainte-
nance of records that,in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly

reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the compa-

ny;(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded

as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accor-

dance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that

receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company;and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding preven-

tion or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,use,or disposi-

tion of the company™s assets that could have a material effect on the

financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations,internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also,projections

of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the

risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions,or that the degree of compliance with the policies or pro-

cedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
In our opinion,the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of income,changes in stockhold-

ers™ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows present fairly,

in all material respects,the financial position of JPMorgan Chase &

Co.and its subsidiaries (the ﬁFirmﬂ) at December 31,2008 and

2007,and the results of their operations and their cash flows for

each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2008 in

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the

United States of America.Also in our opinion,the Firm maintained,in

all material respects,effective internal control over financial reporting

as of December 31,2008,based on criteria established in Internal

Control Œ Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).The

Firm™s management is responsible for these financial statements,for

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial

reporting,included in the accompanying ﬁManagement™s report on

internal control over financial reporting.ﬂOur responsibility is to

express opinions on these financial statements and on the Firm™s

internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated

audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to

obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements

are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal con-

trol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included examining,on a test

basis,evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the finan-

cial statements,assessing the accounting principles used and signifi-

cant estimates made by management,and evaluating the overall

financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over

financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting,assessing the risk that a material

weakness exists,and testing and evaluating the design and operat-

ing effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our

audits also included performing such other procedures as we consid-
ered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audits pro-

vide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Notes to consolidated financial statements134JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Note 1 Œ Basis of presentation 
JPMorgan Chase & Co.(ﬁJPMorgan Chaseﬂor the ﬁFirmﬂ),a financial
holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968,is a lead-

ing global financial services firm and one of the largest banking insti-
tutions in the United States of America (ﬁU.S.ﬂ),with operations world-

wide.The Firm is a leader in investment banking,financial services for

consumers and businesses,financial transaction processing and asset

management.For a discussion of the Firm™s business segment informa-

tion,see Note 37 on pages 226Œ227 of this Annual Report.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase
and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accept-

ed in the United States of America (ﬁU.S.GAAPﬂ).Additionally,where

applicable,the policies conform to the accounting and reporting

guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities.
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conformto the current presentation.Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of

JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a control-
ling financial interest.All material intercompany balances and trans-

actions have been eliminated.The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is the owner-
ship of a majority of the voting interests of the entity.However,a

controlling financial interest also may be deemed to exist with
respect to entities,such as special purpose entities (ﬁSPEsﬂ),through

arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests.
SPEs are an important part of the financial markets,providing market
liquidity by facilitating investors™ access to specific portfolios of
assets and risks.For example,they are critical to the functioning of

the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper

markets.SPEs may be organized as trusts,partnerships or corpora-

tions and are typically established for a single,discrete purpose.SPEs

are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and

no employees.The basic SPE structure involves a company selling

assets to the SPE.The SPE funds the purchase of those assets by

issuing securities to investors.The legal documents that govern the

transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allo-

cated to the SPE™s investors and other parties that have rights to

those cash flows.SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors

from claims on the SPE™s assets by creditors of other entities,includ-

ing the creditors of the seller of the assets.
There are two different accounting frameworks applicable to SPEs:
The qualifying SPE (ﬁQSPEﬂ) framework under SFAS 140 and the

variable interest entity (ﬁVIEﬂ) framework under FIN 46R.The appli-

cable framework depends on the nature of the entity and the Firm™s

relation to that entity.The QSPE framework is applicable when an

entity transfers (sells) financial assets to an SPE meeting certain crite-

ria defined in SFAS 140.These criteria are designed to ensure that

the activities of the entity are essentially predetermined at the incep-
tion of the vehicle and that the transferor of the financial assets can-

not exercise control over the entity and the assets therein.Entities
meeting these criteria are not consolidated by the transferor or other
counterparties as long as they do not have the unilateral ability to

liquidate or to cause the entity to no longer meet the QSPE criteria.
The Firm primarily follows the QSPE model for securitizations of its

residential and commercial mortgages,and credit card,automobile

and student loans.For further details,see Note 16 on pages

180Œ188 of this Annual Report.
When an SPE does not meet the QSPE criteria,consolidation is
assessed pursuant to FIN 46R.Under FIN 46R,a VIE is defined as an

entity that:(1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the

entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated finan-
cial support from other parties;(2) has equity owners that lack the

right to make significant decisions affecting the entity™s operations;

and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to
absorb the entity™s losses or the right to receive the entity™s returns.
FIN 46R requires a variable interest holder (i.e.,a counterparty to a
VIE) to consolidate the VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the

expected losses of the VIE,receive the majority of the expected resid-

ual returns of the VIE,or both.This party is considered the primary

beneficiary.In making this determination,the Firm thoroughly evalu-

ates the VIE™s design,capital structure and relationships among the

variable interest holders.When the primary beneficiary cannot be

identified through a qualitative analysis,the Firm performs a quanti-

tative analysis,which computes and allocates expected losses or

residual returns to variable interest holders.The allocation of expect-

ed cash flows in this analysis is based upon the relative rights and
preferences of each variable interest holder in the VIE™s capital struc-

ture.The Firm reconsiders whether it is the primary beneficiary of a

VIE when certain events occur as required by FIN 46R.For further

details,see Note 17 on pages 189Œ198 of this Annual Report.
All retained interests and significant transactions between the Firm,
QSPEs and nonconsolidated VIEs are reflected on JPMorgan Chase™s

Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Notes to consolidated finan-
cial statements.
Investments in companies that are considered to be voting-interestentities under FIN 46R in which the Firm has significant influence
over operating and financing decisions are either accounted for in

accordance with the equity method of accounting or at fair value if

elected under SFAS 159 (ﬁFair Value Optionﬂ).These investments are

generally included in other assets,with income or loss included in

other income.
For a discussion of the accounting for private equity investments,see
Note 6 on pages 159Œ160 of this Annual Report.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firmare not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated finan-
cial statements 
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires man-

agement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported

amounts of assets and liabilities,revenue and expense,and disclosures
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
135of contingent assets and liabilities.Actual results could be different
from these estimates.For discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates

used by the Firm,see pages 119Œ123 of this Annual Report.
Foreign currency translation 
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets,liabilities,revenue and expense

denominated in non-U.S.currencies into U.S.dollars using applicable

exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial
statements for U.S.reporting are included in other comprehensive

income (loss) within stockholders™ equity.Gains and losses relating

to nonfunctional currency transactions,including non-U.S.operations

where the functional currency is the U.S.dollar,are reported in the

Consolidated Statements of Income.
Foreclosed property
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructur-

ings,workouts,and foreclosures.Property acquired may include real

property (e.g.,land,buildings,and fixtures) and personal property

(e.g.,aircraft,railcars,and ships).Acquired property is valued at fair

value less costs to sell at acquisition.Each quarter the fair value of

the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted,if necessary.Any

adjustments to fair value in the first 90 days are credited/charged to

the allowance for loan losses and thereafter to other expense.
Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase™s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,cash

is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks.
Significant accounting policies The following table identifies JPMorgan Chase™s other significant

accounting policies and the Note and page where a detailed descrip-
tion of each policy can be found.Note 2 Œ Business changes and developments Decrease in Common Stock Dividend
On February 23,2009,the Board of Directors reduced the Firm's quar-

terly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share,effective

for the dividend payable April 30,2009,to shareholders of record on

April 6,2009.
Acquisition of the banking operations of Washington
Mutual Bank 
On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking

operations of Washington Mutual Bank (ﬁWashington Mutualﬂ) from

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (ﬁFDICﬂ) for $1.9 billion.

The acquisition expands JPMorgan Chase™s consumer branch network

into several states,including California,Florida and Washington,

among others.The acquisition also extends the reach of the Firm™s

business banking,commercial banking,credit card,consumer lending

and wealth management businesses.The acquisition was accounted

for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
SFAS 141.
The $1.9 billion purchase price was allocated to the Washington
Mutual assets acquired and liabilities assumed using preliminary
allocated values as of September 25,2008,which resulted in nega-

tive goodwill.The initial allocation of the purchase price was pre-

sented on a preliminary basis at September 30,2008,due to the

short time period between the closing of the transaction (which

occurred simultaneously with its announcement on September 25,
2008) and the end of the third quarter.In accordance with SFAS

141,noncurrent nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale,such

as the premises and equipment and other intangibles,acquired in

the Washington Mutual transaction were written down against the

negative goodwill.The negative goodwill that remained after writing

down the nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary

gain.As a result of the refinement of the purchase price allocation

during the fourth quarter of 2008,the initial extraordinary gain of

$581 million was increased $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion.

(a)The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with SFAS 141.SFAS 141 requires the asset
s (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities(including executory contracts and other commitments) of an acquired business as of the effective date of the acquisition to be
 recorded at their respective fair values and consolidated with
those of JPMorgan Chase.The fair value of the net assets of Washington Mutual™s banking operations exceeded the $1.9 billion pu
rchase price,resulting in negative goodwill.In accordance
with SFAS 141,noncurrent,nonfinancial assets not held-for-sale,such as premises and equipment and other intangibles,were writte
n down against the negative goodwill.The negative good-
will that remained after writing down transaction related core deposit intangibles of approximately $4.9 billion and premises a

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
137Merger with The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
Effective May 30,2008,BSC Merger Corporation,a wholly owned

subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase,merged with The Bear Stearns

Companies Inc.(ﬁBear Stearnsﬂ) pursuant to the Agreement and

Plan of Merger,dated as of March 16,2008,as amended March 24,

2008,and Bear Stearns became a wholly owned subsidiary of

JPMorgan Chase.The merger provided the Firm with a leading global

prime brokerage platform;strengthened the Firm™s equities and asset

management businesses;enhanced capabilities in mortgage origina-

tion,securitization and servicing;and expanded the platform of the

Firm™s energy business.The merger is being accounted for under the

purchase method of accounting,which requires that the assets and

liabilities of Bear Stearns be fair valued.The total purchase price to

complete the merger was $1.5 billion.
The merger with Bear Stearns was accomplished through a series of
transactions that were reflected as step acquisitions in accordance

with SFAS 141.On April 8,2008,pursuant to the share exchange

agreement,JPMorgan Chase acquired 95 million newly issued shares

of Bear Stearns common stock (or 39.5% of Bear Stearns common
stock after giving effect to the issuance) for 21 million shares of
JPMorgan Chase common stock.Further,between March 24,2008,

and May 12,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired approximately 24 mil-

lion shares of Bear Stearns common stock in the open market at an

average purchase price of $12.37 per share.The share exchange and

cash purchase transactions resulted in JPMorgan Chase owning

approximately 49.4% of Bear Stearns common stock immediately
prior to consummation of the merger.Finally,on May 30,2008,
JPMorgan Chase completed the merger.As a result of the merger,

each outstanding share of Bear Stearns common stock (other than
shares then held by JPMorgan Chase) was converted into the right to

receive 0.21753 shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase.Also,

on May 30,2008,the shares of common stock that JPMorgan Chase

and Bear Stearns acquired from each other in the share exchange
transaction were cancelled.From April 8,2008,through May 30,

2008,JPMorgan Chase accounted for the investment in Bear Stearns

under the equity method of accounting in accordance with APB 18.

During this period,JPMorgan Chase recorded reductions to its invest-

ment in Bear Stearns representing its share of Bear Stearns net loss-
es,which was recorded in other income and accumulated other com-

prehensive income.
In conjunction with the Bear Stearns merger,in June 2008,the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the ﬁFRBNYﬂ) took control,

through a limited liability company (ﬁLLCﬂ) formed for this purpose,

of a portfolio of $30 billion in assets acquired from Bear Stearns,

based on the value of the portfolio as of March 14,2008.The assets

of the LLC were funded by a $28.85 billion term loan from the
FRBNY,and a $1.15 billion subordinated loan from JPMorgan Chase.

The JPMorgan Chase note is subordinated to the FRBNY loan and

will bear the first $1.15 billion of any losses of the portfolio.Any

remaining assets in the portfolio after repayment of the FRBNY loan,
the JPMorgan Chase note and the expense of the LLC will be for the
account of the FRBNY.

indicative of the results of operations in future periods.Included in the

unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the years
ended December 31,2008 and 2007,were pro forma adjustments to

reflect the results of operations of Bear Stearns,and Washington

Mutual™s banking operations,considering the purchase accounting,

valuation and accounting conformity adjustments related to each

transaction.For the Washington Mutual transaction,the amortization

of purchase accounting adjustments to report interest-earning assets
acquired and interest-bearing liabilities assumed at current interest

rates is reflected in all periods presented.Valuation adjustments and

the adjustment to conform allowance methodologies in the

Washington Mutual transaction,and valuation and accounting con-

formity adjustments related to the Bear Stearns merger are reflected

in the results for the years ended December 31,2008 and 2007.
Internal reorganization related to the Bear Stearns merger 
On June 30,2008,JPMorgan Chase fully and unconditionally guar-

anteed each series of outstanding preferred stock of Bear Stearns,as

well as all of Bear Stearns™ outstanding Securities and Exchange
Commission (ﬁSECﬂ) registered U.S.debt securities and obligations

relating to trust preferred capital debt securities.Subsequently,on

July 15,2008,JPMorgan Chase completed an internal merger trans-

action,which resulted in each series of outstanding preferred stock

of Bear Stearns being automatically exchanged into newly issued
shares of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock having substantially iden-
tical terms.Depositary shares,which formerly had represented a one-

fourth interest in a share of Bear Stearns preferred stock,continue to

trade on the New York Stock Exchange but following completion of

this internal merger transaction,represent a one-fourth interest in a

share of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock.In addition,on July 31,

2008,JPMorgan Chase assumed (1) all of Bear Stearns™ then-out-

standing SEC-registered U.S.debt securities;(2) Bear Stearns™ obliga-

tions relating to trust preferred capital debt securities;(3) certain of

Bear Stearns™ then-outstanding foreign debt securities;and (4) cer-

tain of Bear Stearns™ guarantees of then-outstanding foreign debt

securities issued by subsidiaries of Bear Stearns,in each case,in

accordance with the agreements and indentures governing these
securities.JPMorgan Chase also guaranteed Bear Stearns™ obligations

under Bear Stearns™ U.S.$30.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note

Programme and U.S.$4.0 billion Euro Note Issuance Programme.
Other business events Termination of Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture 
The dissolution of Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture,a glob-

al payments and merchant acquiring joint venture between
JPMorgan Chase and First Data Corporation,was completed on

November 1,2008.JPMorgan Chase retained approximately 51% of

the business and will operate the business under the name Chase

Paymentech Solutions.The dissolution of Chase Paymentech
Notes to consolidated financial statements140JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Solutions joint venture was accounted 
for as a step acquisition inaccordance with SFAS 141,and the Firm recognized an after-tax gain

of $627 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the dissolu-
tion.The gain represents the amount by which the fair value of the net

assets acquired (predominantly intangible assets and goodwill) exceed-
ed JPMorgan Chase™s book basis in the net assets transferred to First

Data Corporation.Upon dissolution,the Firm began to consolidate the

retained Chase Paymentech Solutions business.
Proceeds from Visa Inc.shares 
On March 19,2008,Visa Inc.(ﬁVisaﬂ) completed its initial public

offering (ﬁIPOﬂ).Prior to the IPO,JPMorgan Chase held approxi-

mately a 13% equity interest in Visa.On March 28,2008,Visa used

a portion of the proceeds from the offering to redeem a portion of
the Firm™s equity interest,which resulted in the recognition of a pre-

tax gain of $1.5 billion (recorded in other income).In conjunction

with the IPO,Visa placed $3.0 billion in escrow to cover liabilities

related to certain litigation matters.The escrow was increased by

$1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008.JPMorgan Chase™s interest

in the escrow was recorded as a reduction of other expense and

reported net to the extent of established litigation reserves.
Purchase of additional interest in Highbridge Capital
Management 
In January 2008,JPMorgan Chase purchased an additional equity

interest in Highbridge Capital Management,LLC (ﬁHighbridgeﬂ).As a

result,the Firm currently owns 77.5% of Highbridge.
Acquisition of the consumer,business banking and middle-
market banking businesses of The Bank of New York in

exchange for selected corporate trust businesses,including

trustee,paying agent,loan agency and document manage-

ment services 
On October 1,2006,JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of

The Bank of New York Company,Inc.™s (ﬁThe Bank of New Yorkﬂ)

consumer,business and middle-market banking businesses in

exchange for selected corporate trust businesses plus a cash pay-

ment of $150 million.The transaction also included a contingent

payment payable to The Bank of New York;the amount due of $25

million was paid in 2008.The acquisition added 339 branches and

more than 400 ATMs,and it significantly strengthened Retail

Financial Services™ distribution network in the New York tri-state

area.The Bank of New York businesses acquired were valued at a

premium of $2.3 billion;the Firm™s corporate trust businesses that

were transferred (i.e.,trustee,paying agent,loan agency and docu-

ment management services) were valued at a premium of $2.2 bil-

lion.This transaction included the acquisition of approximately $7.7

billion in loans net of allowance for loan losses and $12.9 billion in

deposits from the Bank of New York.The Firm also recognized core
deposit intangibles of $485 million,which are being amortized using
an accelerated method over a 10-year period.JPMorgan Chase

recorded an after-tax gain of $622 million on this transaction in the

fourth quarter of 2006.For additional discussion related to the trans-

action,see Note 3 on pages 140Œ141 of this Annual Report.
JPMorgan Partners management

ness and the insurance business that Bank One had bought from

Zurich Insurance in 2003.
Acquisition of private-label credit card portfolio from Kohl™s
Corporation 

On April 21,2006,JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of

$1.6 billion of private-label credit card receivables and approximately

Note 4 Œ Fair value measurement  
In September 2006,the FASB issued SFAS 157 (ﬁFair Value

Measurementsﬂ),which was effective for fiscal years beginning after

November 15,2007,with early adoption permitted.The Firm chose

early adoption for SFAS 157 effective January 1,2007.SFAS 157:
†Defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

between market participants at the measurement date,and

establishes a framework for measuring fair value;
†Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements
based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an

asset or liability as of the measurement date;†Nullifies the guidance in EITF 02-3,which required the deferral of
profit at inception of a transaction involving a derivative financial

instrument in the absence of observable data supporting the val-

uation technique;†Eliminates large position discounts for financial instruments quot-
ed in active markets and requires consideration of the Firm™s

creditworthiness when valuing liabilities;and 
†Expands disclosures about instruments measured at fair value.

The Firm also chose early adoption for SFAS 159 effective January 1,
2007.SFAS 159 provides an option to elect fair value as an alterna-

tive measurement for selected financial assets,financial liabilities,

unrecognized firm commitments and written loan commitments not

previously recorded at fair value.The Firm elected fair value account-

ing for certain assets and liabilities not previously carried at fair
value.For more information,see Note 5 on pages 156Œ158 of this

Annual Report.The following is a description of the Firm™s valuation methodologies
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
The Firm has an established and well-documented process for deter-
mining fair values.Fair value is based upon quoted market prices,

where available.If listed prices or quotes are not available,fair value

is based upon internally developed models that primarily use,as

inputs,market-based or independently sourced market parameters,

including but not limited to yield curves,interest rates,volatilities,

equity or debt prices,foreign exchange rates and credit curves.In

addition to market information,models also incorporate transaction

details,such as maturity of the instrument.Valuation adjustments

may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at
fair value.These adjustments include amounts to reflect counterparty

credit quality,the Firm™s creditworthiness,constraints on liquidity and

unobservable parameters.Valuation adjustments are applied consis-

tently over time.
†Credit valuation adjustments (ﬁCVAﬂ) are necessary when the
market price (or parameter) is not indicative of the credit quality

of the counterparty.As few classes of derivative contracts are list-

ed on an exchange,the majority of derivative positions are val-

ued using internally developed models that use as their basis
observable market parameters.Market practice is to quote

parameters equivalent to an ﬁAAﬂcredit rating whereby all coun-

terparties are assumed to have the same credit quality.Therefore,

an adjustment is necessary to reflect the credit quality of each
derivative counterparty to arrive at fair value.The adjustment also

takes into account contractual factors designed to reduce the

Firm™s credit exposure to each counterparty,such as collateral

and legal rights of offset.†Debit valuation adjustments (ﬁDVAﬂ) are necessary to reflect the
credit quality of the Firm in the valuation of liabilities measured

at fair value.This adjustment was incorporated into the Firm™s

valuations commencing January 1,2007,in accordance with

SFAS 157.The methodology to determine the adjustment is con-

sistent with CVA and incorporates JPMorgan Chase™s credit

spread as observed through the credit default swap market.
†Liquidity valuation adjustments are necessary when the Firm may
not be able to observe a recent market price for a financial

instrument that trades in inactive (or less active) markets or to
Notes to consolidated financial statements142JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
reflect the cost of exiting larger-than-normal market-size risk
positions (liquidity adjustments are not taken for positions classi-

fied within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy).The Firm tries to

ascertain the amount of uncertainty in the initial valuation based

upon the degree of liquidity of the market in which the financial

instrument trades and makes liquidity adjustments to the carrying

value of the financial instrument.The Firm measures the liquidity

adjustment based upon the following factors:(1) the amount of

time since the last relevant pricing point;(2) whether there was

an actual trade or relevant external quote;and (3) the volatility of

the principal risk component of the financial instrument.Costs to

exit larger-than-normal market-size risk positions are determined

based upon the size of the adverse market move that is likely to

occur during the period required to bring a position down to a
nonconcentrated level.
†Unobservable parameter valuation adjustments are necessary
when positions are valued using internally developed models that

use as their basis unobservable parameters Œ that is,parameters

that must be estimated and are,therefore,subject to manage-

ment judgment.These positions are normally traded less actively.

Examples include certain credit products where parameters such

as correlation and recovery rates are unobservable.Unobservable

parameter valuation adjustments are applied to mitigate the pos-

sibility of error and revision in the estimate of the market price

provided by the model.The Firm has numerous controls in place intended to ensure that its fair
valuations are appropriate.An independent model review group

reviews the Firm™s valuation models and approves them for use for spe-

cific products.All valuation models within the Firm are subject to this

review process.A price verification group,independent from the risk-

taking function,ensures observable market prices and market-based

parameters are used for valuation wherever possible.For those prod-

ucts with material parameter risk for which observable market levels do

not exist,an independent review of the assumptions made on pricing is

performed.Additional review includes deconstruction of the model val-

uations for certain structured instruments into their components,and

benchmarking valuations,where possible,to similar products;validating

valuation estimates through actual cash settlement;and detailed

review and explanation of recorded gains and losses,which are ana-

lyzed daily and over time.Valuation adjustments,which are also deter-

mined by the independent price verification group,are based upon

established policies and are applied consistently over time.Any changes

to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management to confirm

the changes are justified.As markets and products develop and the

pricing for certain products becomes more or less transparent,the Firm

continues to refine its valuation methodologies.During 2008,no mate-

rial changes were made to the Firm™s valuation models.
The methods described above to estimate fair value may produce a
fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value

or reflective of future fair values.Furthermore,while the Firm believes

its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other mar-

ket participants,the use of different methodologies or assumptions to

determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in

a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Valuation Hierarchy 
SFAS 157 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure

of fair value measurements.The valuation hierarchy is based upon

the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as

of the measurement date.The three levels are defined as follows.
†Level 1 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
†Level 2 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,and

inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,either directly

or indirectly,for substantially the full term of the financial instru-

ment.†Level 3 Œ inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
and significant to the fair value measurement.For a level 3 analy-

sis,see pages 150Œ151 of this Note.
A financial instrument™s categorization within the valuation hierarchy
is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
instruments measured at fair value,including the general classifica-

tion of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Assets 
Securities purchased under resale agreements (ﬁresale
agreementsﬂ) 

To estimate the fair value of resale agreements,cash flows are evalu-

ated taking into consideration any derivative features of the resale

agreement and are then discounted using the appropriate market

rates for the applicable maturity.As the inputs into the valuation are

primarily based upon readily observable pricing information,such

resale agreements are generally classified within level 2 of the valua-

tion hierarchy.
Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments 
The majority of the Firm™s loans and lending-related commitments

are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

Balance Sheets,nor are they actively traded.The fair value of such

loans and lending-related commitments is included in the disclosures
required by SFAS 107 on pages 154Œ155 of this Note.Loans carried

at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis are included in

the applicable tables that follow.
WholesaleThe fair value of loans and lending-related commitments is calculat-

ed using observable market information,including pricing from actu-

al market transactions or broker quotations where available.Where

pricing information is not available for the specific loan,the valuation

is generally based upon quoted market prices of similar instruments,

such as loans and bonds.These comparable instruments share char-

acteristics that typically include industry,rating,capital structure,sen-

iority,and consideration of counterparty credit risk.In addition,gen-

eral market conditions,including prevailing market spreads for credit

and liquidity risk,are also considered in the valuation process.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
143For certain loans that are expected to be securitized,such as commer-
cial and residential mortgages,fair value is estimated based upon

observable pricing of asset-backed securities (ﬁABSﬂ) with similar col-

lateral and incorporates adjustments (i.e.,reductions) to these prices

to account for securitization uncertainties including portfolio composi-
tion,market conditions and liquidity to arrive at the whole loan price.

When data from recent market transactions is available it is incorpo-

rated as appropriate.If particular loans are not expected to be securi-

tized they are marked for individual sale taking into consideration

potential liquidation proceeds and property repossession/liquidation
information,as appropriate.For further discussion of the valuation of

mortgage loans carried at fair value,see the ﬁMortgage-related expo-

sures carried at fair valueﬂsection of this Note on pages 151Œ153.
The Firm™s loans carried at fair value and reported in trading assets
are largely classified within level 3 due to the lack of observable pric-

ing.Loans carried at fair value and reported in loans including lever-

aged lending funded loans,high-yield bridge financing and purchased

nonperforming loans held in the Investment Bank (ﬁIBﬂ) are classified
within level 2 or 3 of the valuation hierarchy depending on the level

of liquidity and activity in the markets for a particular product.
ConsumerFair values for consumer installment loans (including automobile

financings and consumer real estate not expected to be securitized),
for which market rates for comparable loans are readily available,are

based upon discounted cash flows adjusted for prepayment assump-
tions.The discount rates used for consumer installment loans are

based on current market rates for new originations of comparable

loans.Fair value for credit card receivables is based upon discounted

expected cash flows.The discount rates used for credit card receiv-

ables incorporate only the effects of interest rate changes,since the

expected cash flows already reflect an adjustment for credit risk.
Consumer installment loans and credit card receivables that are not

carried on the balance sheet at fair value are not classified within

the fair value hierarchy.For further discussion of the valuation of

mortgage loans carried at fair value,see the ﬁMortgage-related

exposures carried at fair valueﬂsection of this Note.
Securities Where quoted prices for identical securities are available in an active

market,securities are classified in level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds,mortgage

products for which there are quoted prices in active markets (such as

U.S.government agency or U.S.government-sponsored enterprise pass-

through mortgage-backed securities) and exchange-traded equities.
If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security,the
Firm may estimate the value of such instruments using a combina-

tion of observed transaction prices,independent pricing services and

relevant broker quotes.Consideration is given to the nature of the

quotes (e.g.,indicative or firm) and the relationship of recently evi-

denced market activity to the prices provided from independent pric-

ing services.The Firm may also use pricing models or discounted

cash flows.In cases where there is limited activity or less transparen-

cy around inputs to the valuation,securities are classified within level

3 of the valuation hierarchy.
For certain collateralized mortgage and debt obligations,asset-backed
securities and high-yield debt securities the determination of fair value

may require benchmarking to similar instruments or analyzing defaultand recovery rates.For ﬁcashﬂcollateralized debt obligations

(ﬁCDOsﬂ),external price information is not available.Therefore,cash

CDOs are valued using market-standard models,such as Intex,to

model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of

each deal;key inputs to the model are market spread data for each

credit rating,collateral type and other relevant contractual features.

Asset-backed securities are valued based on external prices or market

spread data,using current market assumptions on prepayments and

defaults.For those asset-backed securities where the external price

data is not observable or the limited available data is opaque,the col-

lateral performance is monitored and the value of the security is

assessed.To benchmark its valuations,the Firm looks to transactions

for similar instruments and utilizes independent pricing provided by
third-party vendors,broker quotes and relevant market indices such as

the ABX index,as applicable.While none of those sources are solely

indicative of fair value,they serve as directional indicators for the

appropriateness of the Firm™s estimates.The majority of collateralized

mortgage and debt obligations,high-yield debt securities and asset-

backed securities are currently classified in level 3 of the valuation

hierarchy.For further discussion of the valuation of mortgage securi-

ties carried at fair value 
see the ﬁMortgage-related exposures carried
at fair valueﬂsection of this Note on pages 151Œ153.
Commodities Commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or fair value.

The fair value for commodities inventory is determined primarily

using pricing and data derived from the markets on which the under-

lying commodities are traded.Market prices may be adjusted for liq-

uidity.The Firm also has positions in commodity-based derivatives

that can be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter.The pricing

inputs to these derivatives include forward curves of underlying com-

modities,basis curves,volatilities,correlations,and occasionally other

model parameters.The valuation of these derivatives is based upon

calibrating to market transactions,as well as to independent pricing

information from sources such as brokers and dealer consensus pric-

ing services.Where inputs are unobservable,they are benchmarked

to observable market data based upon historic and implied correla-

tions,then adjusted for uncertainty where appropriate.The majority

of commodities inventory and commodities-based derivatives are

classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices are classified

within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.However,few classes of

derivative contracts are listed on an exchange;thus,the majority of

the Firm™s derivative positions are valued using internally developed

models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters

Œ that is,parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated to

external sources,including industry pricing services.Depending on

the types and contractual terms of derivatives,fair value can be mod-

eled using a series of techniques,such as the Black-Scholes option

pricing model,simulation models or a combination of various mod-
Notes to consolidated financial statements144JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
els,which are consistently applied.Where derivative products have
been established for some time,the Firm uses models that are widely

accepted in the financial services industry.These models reflect the

contractual terms of the derivatives,including the period to maturity,

and market-based parameters such as interest rates,volatility,and

the credit quality of the counterparty.Further,many of these models

do not contain a high level of subjectivity,as the methodologies used

in the models do not require significant judgment,and inputs to the

model are readily observable from actively quoted markets,as is the

case for ﬁplain vanillaﬂinterest rate swaps and option contracts and

credit default swaps (ﬁCDSﬂ).Such instruments are generally classi-

fied within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unob-
servable market parameters and that are normally traded less active-

ly,have trade activity that is one way,and/or are traded in less-

developed markets are classified within level 3 of the valuation hier-

archy.Level 3 derivatives,for example,include credit default swaps

referenced to mortgage-backed securities,certain types of CDO

transactions,options on baskets of single-name stocks,and callable

exotic interest rate options.Such derivatives are primarily used for

risk management purposes.
For certain derivative products,such as credit default swaps refer-
enced to mortgage-backed securities,the value is based on the

underlying mortgage risk.As these instruments are not actively quoted,

the estimate of fair value considers the valuation of the underlying

collateral (mortgage loans).Inputs to the valuation will include avail-

able information on similar underlying loans or securities in the cash
market.The prepayments and loss assumptions on the underlying

loans or securities are estimated using a combination of historical
data,prices on market transactions,and other prepayment and

default scenarios and analysis.Relevant observable market indices

such as the ABX or CMBX,are considered,as well as any relevant

transaction activity.
Other complex products,such as those sensitive to correlation
between two or more underlyings,also fall within level 3 of the

hierarchy.Such instruments include complex credit derivative prod-

ucts which are illiquid and non-standard in nature,including CDOs

and CDO-squared.A CDO is a debt security collateralized by a vari-

ety of debt obligations,including bonds and loans of different matu-

rities and credit qualities.The repackaging of such securities and

loans within a CDO results in the creation of tranches,which are

instruments with differing risk profiles.In a CDO-squared,the instru-

ment is a CDO where the underlying debt instruments are also
CDOs.For CDO-squared transactions,while inputs such as CDS

spreads and recovery rates may be observable,the correlation

between the underlying debt instruments is unobservable.The corre-

lation levels are not only modeled on a portfolio basis but are also
calibrated at a transaction level to liquid benchmark tranches.For all

complex credit derivative products,actual transactions,where avail-

able,are used to regularly recalibrate all unobservable parameters.
Correlation sensitivity is also material to the overall valuation of
options on baskets of single-name stocks;the valuation of these bas-

kets is typically not observable due to their non-standardized struc-
turing.Correlation for products such as these are typically estimated
based on an observable basket of stocks and then adjusted to reflect

the differences between the underlying equities.
For callable exotic interest rate options,while most of the assump-
tions in the valuation can be observed in active markets (e.g.interest

rates and volatility),the callable option transaction flow is essentially

one-way,and as such,price observability is limited.As pricing infor-

mation is limited,assumptions are based upon the dynamics of the

underlying markets (e.g.the interest rate markets) including the

range and possible outcomes of the applicable inputs.In addition,

the models used are calibrated,as relevant,to liquid benchmarks

and valuation is tested against monthly independent pricing services

and actual transactions.
Mortgage servicing rights and certain retained interests in
securitizations 
Mortgage servicing rights (ﬁMSRsﬂ) and certain retained interests
from securitization activities do not trade in an active,open market

with readily observable prices.While sales of MSRs do occur,the pre-

cise terms and conditions typically are not readily available.

Accordingly,the Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs and certain

other retained interests in securitizations using discounted cash flow
(ﬁDCFﬂ) models.
†For MSRs,the Firm uses an option-adjusted spread (ﬁOASﬂ) valu-
ation model in conjunction with the Firm™s proprietary prepayment

model to project MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate sce-

narios,which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates to esti-

mate an expected fair value of the MSRs.The OAS model consid-

ers portfolio characteristics,contractually specified servicing fees,

prepayment assumptions,delinquency rates,late charges,other

ancillary revenue,costs to service and other economic factors.The

Firm reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and
assumptions used in the OAS model to reflect market conditions

and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valu-

ing the MSR asset.Due to the nature of the valuation inputs,

MSRs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
†For certain retained interests in securitizations (such as interest-
only strips),a single interest rate path discounted cash flow

model is used and generally includes assumptions based upon

projected finance charges related to the securitized assets,esti-

mated net credit losses,prepayment assumptions and contractual

interest paid to third-party investors.Changes in the assumptions

used may have a significant impact on the Firm™s valuation of

retained interests,and such interests are therefore typically classi-

fied within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
For both MSRs and certain other retained interests in securitizations,
the Firm compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to

observable market data where available and to recent market activity

and actual portfolio experience.For further discussion of the most

significant assumptions used to value retained interests in securitiza-

tions and MSRs,as well as the applicable stress tests for those

assumptions,see Note 16 and Note 18 on pages 180Œ188 and

198Œ201,respectively,of this Annual Report.

145Private equity investments The valuation of nonpublic private equity investments,held primarily

by the Private Equity business within Corporate,requires significant

management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices,

the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets.

As such,private equity investments are valued initially based upon

cost.Each quarter,valuations are reviewed utilizing available and rel-

evant market data to determine if the carrying value of these invest-

ments should be adjusted.Such market data primarily includes

observations of the trading multiples of public companies considered

comparable to the private companies being valued and the operating

performance of the underlying portfolio company,including its histor-

ical and projected net income and earnings before interest,taxes,

depreciation and amortization (ﬁEBITDAﬂ).Valuations are adjusted to

account for company-specific issues,the lack of liquidity inherent in a

nonpublic investment and the fact that comparable public companies

are not identical to the companies being valued.In addition,a vari-

ety of additional factors are reviewed by management,including,but

not limited to,financing and sales transactions with third parties,

future expectations of the particular investment,changes in market

outlook and the third-party financing environment.The Firm applies

its valuation methodology consistently from period to period and

believes that the methodology and associated valuation adjustments

are appropriate.Nonpublic private equity investments are included in

level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Private equity investments also include publicly held equity invest-
ments,generally obtained through the initial public offering of privately

held equity investments.Publicly held investments in liquid markets are

marked to market at the quoted public value less adjustments for reg-

ulatory or contractual sales restrictions.Discounts for restrictions are

quantified by analyzing the length of the restriction period and the
volatility of the equity security.Publicly held investments are largely

classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Other assets The fair value of asset-backed commercial paper (ﬁABCPﬂ) invest-

ments purchased under the Federal Reserve™s Asset-Backed

Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility

(ﬁAML Facilityﬂ) for U.S.money market mutual funds is determined

based on observable market information and is classified in level 2 

of the valuation hierarchy.
Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements (ﬁrepurchase
agreementsﬂ) 

To estimate the fair value of repurchase agreements,cash flows are

evaluated taking into consideration any derivative features and are

then discounted using the appropriate market rates for the applica-

ble maturity.Generally,for these types of agreements,there is a

requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal

to,or in excess of,the principal amount loaned;as a result,there

would be no adjustment,or an immaterial adjustment,to reflect the

credit quality of the Firm (i.e.,DVA) related to these agreements.As

the inputs into the valuation are primarily based upon observable

pricing information,repurchase agreements are classified within level

2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 
The fair value of beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs

(ﬁbeneficial interestsﬂ) is estimated based upon the fair value of the

underlying assets held by the VIEs.The valuation of beneficial inter-

ests does not include an adjustment to reflect the credit quality of
the Firm,as the holders of these beneficial interests do not have

recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase.As the inputs into

the valuation are generally based upon readily observable market

pricing information,the majority of beneficial interests issued by con-

solidated VIEs are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Deposits,other borrowed funds and long-term debt 
Included within deposits,other borrowed funds and long-term debt

are structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments
containing embedded derivatives.To estimate the fair value of struc-

tured notes,cash flows are evaluated taking into consideration any

derivative features and are then discounted using the appropriate

market rates for the applicable maturities.In addition,the valuation

of structured notes includes an adjustment to reflect the credit quali-
ty of the Firm (i.e.,the DVA).Where the inputs into the valuation are

primarily based upon readily observable market pricing information,

the structured notes are classified within level 2 of the valuation

hierarchy.Where significant inputs are unobservable,structured notes

are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

Notes to consolidated financial statements148JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 
The tables below include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts for the years ended December 31,2008 and 2007 (including th
e change infair value),for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.When a determination is 
made to classify afinancial instrument within level 3,the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable parameters to the over
all fair value
measurement.However,level 3 financial instruments typically include,in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,obser
vable compo-
nents (that is,components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly,the gains and losses i
n the table belowinclude changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.Also,the Firm risk m
anages the observ-able components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 o
r 2 of the valuation
hierarchy;as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below,the gains or losses in the tables do 
not reflect theeffect of the Firm™s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
Certain assets,liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis;that is,
the instrumentsare not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for
 example,when
there is evidence of impairment).The following tables present the financial instruments carried on the Consolidated Balance She
ets by captionand level within the SFAS 157 valuation hierarchy (as described above) as of December 31,2008 and 2007,for which a nonrecurring
 change
in fair value has been recorded during the reporting period.

Level 3 analysis   
Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonre-

curring basis) were 6% of total Firm assets at December 31,2008.

The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets during

the year.
Level 3 assets increased $46.9 billion in 2008,largely due to the
following:†Acquisition of $41.5 billion of level 3 assets as a result of the
merger with Bear Stearns.
†Acquisition of $5.9 billion of MSRs related to the Washington
Mutual transaction.
†Purchase of approximately $4.4 billion of reverse mortgages in
the first quarter of 2008,for which there is limited pricing infor-

mation and a lack of market liquidity.
†Transfers of $14.0 billion of AAA-rated CLOs backed by corporate
loans,based upon a significant reduction in new deal issuance

and price transparency;$10.5 billion of mortgage-related assets,

including commercial mortgage-backed securities with a rating

below ﬁAAAﬂ,other noninvestment grade mortgage securities and

certain prime mortgages;and $2.8 billion of auction-rate securi-

ties,in each case due to a significant reduction in market liquidity.
The increases in level 3 assets described above were partially offset by:

†Approximately $20.0 billion of sales and markdowns of residen-
tial mortgage-backed securities,prime residential mortgage loans

and Alt-A residential mortgage loans.
†$11.5 billion of sales and markdowns of leveraged loans,as well
as transfers of similar loans to level 2 due to the increased price

transparency for such assets.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
151†$3.5 billion of transfers of bridge loans to level 2 due to
increased price transparency for such assets.
Gains and LossesGains and losses in the tables above for 2008 include:†Losses on trading debt and equity instruments of approximately
$12.8 billion,principally from mortgage-related transactions and

auction-rate securities.
†A $6.9 billion decline in the fair value of the MSR asset.

†Losses of approximately $3.9 billion on leveraged loans.
Leveraged loans are typically classified as held-for-sale and meas-

ured at the lower of cost or fair value and therefore included in

the nonrecurring fair value assets.
†Gains of $4.5 billion related to structured notes,principally due
to significant volatility in the equity markets.
†Net gains of $4.6 billion related to derivatives,principally due to
changes in credit spreads and rate curves.
The Firm risk manages level 3 financial instruments using securities
and derivative positions classified within level 1 or 2 of the valuation

hierarchy;the effect of these risk management activities is not

reflected in the level 3 gains and losses included in the tables above.
For further information on changes in the fair value of the MSRs,see
Note 18 on pages 199Œ200 of this Annual Report.
Credit adjustments 
When determining the fair value of an instrument,it may be neces-

sary to record a valuation adjustment to arrive at an exit price in

accordance with SFAS 157.Valuation adjustments include,but are

not limited to,amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the

Firm™s own creditworthiness.For a detailed discussion of the valua-

tion adjustments the Firm considers,see the valuation discussion at

the beginning of this Note.

Annual Report.The market™s view of the Firm™s credit quality is reflected in credit
spreads observed in the credit default swap market.These credit

spreads are affected by a number of factors,such as the performance

of the assets the Firm holds.Consequently,significant deterioration in

the value of sizable exposures held by the Firm are likely to result in

wider credit default swap spreads.This will lead to an increase in the

Firm™s credit adjustment (i.e.,DVA) for liabilities carried at fair value.
Mortgage-related exposures carried at fair value 
As noted above,certain of the Firm™s wholesale and consumer loans

are carried at fair value including mortgage-related loans.Since the

second half of 2007,liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage mar-

kets has decreased,thereby limiting the price transparency of certain

mortgage-related instruments.The table below summarizes the Firm™s

mortgage-related exposures that are carried at fair value through earn-

ings or at the lower of cost or fair value;the table excludes securities

held in the available-for-sale portfolio.

mortgage servicing rights,which are reported in Note 18 on pages 199Œ200 of this

Annual Report.(c)Also excluded from the table above are certain mortgage-related financing transac-
tions,which are collateralized by mortgage-related assets,of $5.7 billion at December

31,2008.These financing transactions are excluded from the table as they are

accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting.For financings deemed to be

impaired,impairment is measured and recognized based upon the fair value of the

collateral.Of these financing transactions,$1.2 billion at December 31,2008,was

considered impaired.(d)The amounts presented reflect the effects of derivatives utilized to risk manage the
gross exposures arising from cash-based instruments and are presented on a bond or
loan equivalent (notional) basis.Derivatives are excluded from the gross exposure as

they are principally used for risk management purposes.
(e)Net gains and losses include all revenue related to the positions (i.e.,interest income,
changes in fair value of the assets,changes in fair value of the related risk manage-

ment positions,and interest expense related to the liabilities funding the positions).
Notes to consolidated financial statements152JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Residential mortgages Prime MortgageŒ The Firm had exposure of $11.2 billion to prime
mortgages carried at fair value through earnings or at the lower of

cost or fair value at December 31,2008,which consisted of $2.9 bil-

lion of securities (including $1.2 billion of forward purchase commit-

ments),largely rated ﬁAAAﬂ,and $8.3 billion of first-lien mortgages.
Alt-A mortgage Œ The Firm had exposure of $3.9 billion to Alt-A
mortgages carried at fair value through earnings or at the lower of

cost or fair value at December 31,2008,which consisted of $787

million of securities and $3.1 billion of first-lien mortgages.
Subprime mortgageŒ The Firm had exposure of $941 million to sub-
prime mortgages carried at fair value through earnings or at the

lower of cost or fair value at December 31,2008,which included

$680 million of securities and $261 million of first-lien mortgages.
Classification and ValuationResidential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are clas-

sified within level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy depending

on the level of liquidity and activity in the markets for a particular

product.Level 3 assets include residential whole loans,prime and

Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities rated below ﬁAAAﬂ,

subprime residential mortgage-backed securities and single-name

CDS on ABS.Products that continue to have reliable price trans-

parency as evidenced by consistent market transactions,such as

AAA-rated prime and Alt-A securities,as well as agency securities,

continue to be classified in level 2.For those products classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy,
the Firm estimates the value of such instruments using a combination

of observed transaction prices,independent pricing services and rele-

vant broker quotes.Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes

(e.g.,indicative or firm) and the relationship of recently evidenced mar-

ket activity to the prices provided from independent pricing services.
When relevant market activity is not occurring or is limited,the fair
value is estimated as follows:
Residential mortgage loans Œ Fair value of residential mortgage
loans is estimated by projecting the expected cash flows and dis-
counting those cash flows at a rate reflective of current market liq-

uidity.To estimate the projected cash flows (inclusive of assumptions

of prepayment,default rates and loss severity),specific consideration

is given to both borrower-specific and other market factors including,

but not limited to:the borrower™s FICO score;the type of collateral

supporting the loan;an estimate of the current value of the collateral

supporting the loan;the level of documentation for the loan;and

market-derived expectations for home price appreciation or deprecia-

tion in the respective geography of the borrower.
Residential mortgage-backed securitiesŒ Fair value of residential
mortgage-backed securities is estimated considering the value of the

collateral and the specific attributes of the securities held by the

Firm.The value of the collateral pool supporting the securities is ana-
lyzed using the same techniques and factors described above for res-idential mortgage loans,albeit in a more aggregated manner across

the pool.For example,average FICO scores,average delinquency

rates,average loss severities and prepayment rates,among other

metrics,may be evaluated.In addition,as each securitization vehicle

distributes cash in a manner or order that is predetermined at the
inception of the vehicle,the priority in which each particular mort-

gage-backed security is allocated cash flows,and the level of credit

enhancement that is in place to support those cash flows,are key

considerations in deriving the value of residential mortgage-backed

securities.Finally,the risk premium that investors demand for securi-

tized products in today™s market is factored into the valuation.To

benchmark its valuations,the Firm looks to transactions for similar

instruments and utilizes independent pricing provided by third-party
vendors,broker quotes and relevant market indices such as the ABX

index,as applicable.While none of those sources are solely indicative

of fair value,they serve as directional indicators for the appropriate-

ness of the Firm™s estimates.
Commercial mortgages 
Commercial mortgages are loans to companies backed by commer-

cial real estate.Commercial mortgage-backed securities are securities

collateralized by a pool of commercial mortgages.Typically,commer-

cial mortgages have lock-out periods,where the borrower is restrict-

ed from prepaying the loan for a specified timeframe,or periods

where there are disincentives for the borrower to prepay the loan
due to prepayment penalties.These features reduce prepayment risk

for commercial mortgages relative to that of residential mortgages.
The Firm had exposure to $7.2 billion of commercial mortgage-
backed assets carried at fair value through earnings or at the lower

of cost or fair value at December 31,2008,which consisted of $2.8

billion of securities,largely rated ﬁAAAﬂ,and $4.4 billion of first-lien

mortgages,largely in the U.S.
Classification and ValuationWhile commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed

securities are classified within level 2 or level 3 of the valuation hier-

archy,depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the markets,

the majority of these mortgages,including both loans and lower-

rated securities,are currently classified in level 3.Level 2 assets

include AAA-rated fixed-rate commercial mortgage-backed securities.
Commercial mortgage loansŒ Fair value of commercial mortgage
loans is estimated by projecting the expected cash flows and dis-
counting those cash flows at a rate reflective of current market liq-

uidity.To estimate the projected cash flows,consideration is given to

both borrower-specific and other market factors including,but not

limited to:the borrower™s debt-to-service coverage ratio;the type of

commercial property (e.g.,retail,office,lodging,multi-family,etc.);an

estimate of the current loan-to-value ratio;and market-derived

expectations for property price appreciation or depreciation in the
respective geographic location.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
153Commercial mortgage-backed securities
Œ When relevant market
activity is not present or is limited,the value of commercial mort-

gage-backed securities is estimated considering the value of the col-

lateral and the specific attributes of the securities held by the Firm.

The value of the collateral pool supporting the securities is analyzed

using the same techniques and factors described above for the valu-

ation of commercial mortgage loans,albeit in a more aggregated

manner across the pool.For example,average delinquencies,loan or

geographic concentrations and average debt-service coverage ratios,

among other metrics,may be evaluated.In addition,as each securiti-

zation vehicle distributes cash in a manner or order that is predeter-
mined at the inception of the vehicle,the priority in which each par-
ticular mortgage-backed security is allocated cash flows,and the
level of credit enhancement that is in place to support those cash
flows,are key considerations in deriving the value of commercial

mortgage-backed securities.Finally,the risk premium that investors

demand for securitized products in today™s market is factored into

the valuation.To benchmark its valuations,the Firm utilizes inde-

pendent pricing provided by third-party vendors,and broker quotes,

as applicable.While none of those sources are solely indicative of fair

value,they serve as directional indicators for the appropriateness of

the Firm™s estimates.

Exposures in the table above include $140.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale in the Firm™s

Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,2008.These invest-

ments are primarily used as part of the Firm™s centralized risk man-

agement of structural interest rate risk (the sensitivity of the Firm™s

aggregate balance sheet to changes in interest rates).Changes in

the Firm™s structural interest rate position,as well as changes in the

overall interest rate environment,are continually monitored,result-

ing in periodic repositioning of mortgage-backed securities classi-

fied as available-for-sale.Given that this portfolio is primarily used

to manage interest rate risk,predominantly all of these securities

are backed by either U.S.government agencies,government spon-

sored entities,or they are rated ﬁAAAﬂ.
Investment securities in the available-for-sale portfolio include:

†$6.9 billion of prime and Alt-A securities,principally rated
ﬁAAAﬂ.The fair value of these securities is determined based

upon independent pricing services supported by relevant and

observable market data for similar securities.The Firm classifies

these securities in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
†$3.9 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities,princi-
pally rated ﬁAAAﬂ.The fair value of these securities is deter-

mined using a third party pricing service that uses relevant and

observable market data.The Firm classifies these securities in

level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
†$127.0 billion of U.S.government agencies or U.S.government-
sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities.Where these

securities trade in active markets and there is market-observ-

able pricing,they are classified in level 1 of the valuation hier-

archy.Where the determination of fair value is based on broker

quotes and independent pricing services,supported by relevant

and observable market data,the Firm classifies such securities

in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Notes to consolidated financial statements154JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
SFAS 157 Transition
In connection with the initial adoption of SFAS 157,the Firm

recorded the following on January 1,2007:
†a cumulative effect increase to retained earnings of $287 mil-
lion,primarily related to the release of profit previously deferred

in accordance with EITF 02-3;†an increase to pretax income of $166 million ($103 million
after-tax) related to the incorporation of the Firm™s creditworthi-

ness in the valuation of liabilities recorded at fair value;and 
†an increase to pretax income of $464 million ($288 million
after-tax) related to valuations of nonpublic private equity

investments.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 157,the Firm applied the provisions
of EITF 02-3 to its derivative portfolio.EITF 02-3 precluded the

recognition of initial trading profit in the absence of:(a) quoted

market prices,(b) observable prices of other current market transac-

tions or (c) other observable data supporting a valuation technique.

In accordance with EITF 02-3,the Firm recognized the deferred

profit in principal transactions revenue on a systematic basis (typi-

cally straight-line amortization over the life of the instruments) and

when observable market data became available.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 157 the Firm did not incorporate an
adjustment into the valuation of liabilities carried at fair value on

the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Commencing January 1,2007,in

accordance with the requirements of SFAS 157,an adjustment was

made to the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value to reflect

the credit quality of the Firm.Prior to the adoption of SFAS 157,privately held investments were
initially valued based upon cost.The carrying values of privately

held investments were adjusted from cost to reflect both positive

and negative changes evidenced by financing events with third-
party capital providers.The investments were also subject to ongo-

ing impairment reviews by private equity senior investment profes-

sionals.The increase in pretax income related to nonpublic private

equity investments in connection with the adoption of SFAS 157

was due to there being sufficient market evidence to support an
increase in fair values using the SFAS 157 methodology,although
there had not been an actual third-party market transaction related

to such investments.
Financial disclosures required by SFAS 107 
Many but not all of the financial instruments held by the Firm are
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.SFAS

107 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain finan-

cial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used

to estimate their fair value.Financial instruments within the scope

of SFAS 107 are included in the table below.Additionally,certain

financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded
from the scope of SFAS 107.Accordingly,the fair value disclosures

required by SFAS 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair

value of JPMorgan Chase.For example,the Firm has developed

long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base

and credit card accounts,commonly referred to as core deposit

intangibles and credit card relationships.In the opinion of manage-

ment,these items,in the aggregate,add significant value to

JPMorgan Chase,but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note.
Financial instruments for which fair value approximates
carrying value 
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets are carried at amounts that approxi-

mate fair value due to their short-term nature and generally negligi-

ble credit risk.These instruments include cash and due from banks,

deposits with banks,federal funds sold and securities purchased

under resale agreements and securities borrowed with short-dated
maturities,short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable,

commercial paper,federal funds purchased and securities loaned or

sold under repurchase agreements with short-dated maturities,other

borrowed funds (excluding advances from Federal Home Loan

Banks),accounts payable and accrued liabilities.In addition,SFAS

107 requires that the fair value for deposit liabilities with no stated

maturity (i.e.,demand,savings and certain money market deposits)

be equal to their carrying value.SFAS 107 does not allow for the

recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments.

(a)The fair value of interest-bearing deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using the appropriate market rates for t
he applicable maturity.
(b)Fair value for long-term debt,including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaran
teed capital debt securities,is based upon current market
rates and adjusted for JPMorgan Chase™s credit quality.
The majority of the Firm™s unfunded lending-related commitments are
not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

Balance Sheets nor are they actively traded.Although there is no liq-

uid secondary market for wholesale commitments,the Firm estimates

the fair value of its wholesale lending-related commitments primarily

using the cost of credit derivatives (which is adjusted to account for

the difference in recovery rates between bonds,upon which the cost

of credit derivatives is based,and loans) and loan equivalents (which

represent the portion of an unused commitment expected,based
upon the Firm™s average portfolio historical experience,to become
outstanding in the event an obligor defaults).On this basis,the esti-

mated fair value of the Firm™s lending-related commitments at

December 31,2008 and 2007,was a liability of $7.5 billion and

$1.9 billion,respectively.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of

consumer lending-related commitments.In many cases,the Firm can

reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior
notice,or,in some cases,without notice as permitted by law.
Notes to consolidated financial statements156JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Note 5 Œ Fair value option
In February 2007,the FASB issued SFAS 159,which was effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15,2007,with early adoption

permitted.The Firm chose early adoption for SFAS 159 effective

January 1,2007.SFAS 159 provides an option to elect fair value as

an alternative measurement for selected financial assets,financial lia-

bilities,unrecognized firm commitments,and written loan commit-

ments not previously carried at fair value.
ElectionsThe following is a discussion of the primary financial instruments for

which fair value elections were made and the basis for those elections:
Loans and unfunded lending-related commitmentsOn January 1,2007,the Firm elected to record,at fair value,the fol-

lowing:†Loans and unfunded lending-related commitments that are
extended as part of IB™s principal investing activities.The transi-

tion amount related to these loans included a reversal of the
allowance for loan losses of $56 million.
†Certain loans held-for-sale.These loans were reclassified to trad-
ing assets Œ debt and equity instruments.This election enabled

the Firm to record loans purchased as part of the Investment
Bank™s commercial mortgage securitization activity and propri-

etary activities at fair value and discontinue SFAS 133 fair value

hedge relationships for certain originated loans.
Beginning on January 1,2007,the Firm chose to elect fair value as
the measurement attribute for the following loans originated or pur-
chased after that date:†Loans purchased or originated as part of IB™s securitization 
warehousing activities.
†Prime mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell within
Retail Financial Services (ﬁRFSﬂ).The election to fair value the above loans did not include loans
within these portfolios that existed on January 1,2007,based upon

the short holding period of the loans and/or the negligible impact of
the elections.
Warehouse loans elected to be reported at fair value are classified as
trading assets Œ debt and equity instruments.For additional informa-

tion regarding warehouse loans,see Note 16 on pages 180Œ188 of

this Annual Report.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2007,the Firm elected the fair
value option for newly originated bridge financing activity in IB.

These elections were made to align further the accounting basis of

the bridge financing activities with their related risk management
practices.For these activities,the loans continue to be classified

within loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets;the fair value of

the unfunded commitments is recorded within accounts payable and

other liabilities.
Securities Financing ArrangementsOn January 1,2007,the Firm elected to record at fair value resale

and repurchase agreements with an embedded derivative or a

maturity of greater than one year.The intent of this election was to

mitigate volatility due to the differences in the measurement basis
for the agreements (which were previously accounted for on an
accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements

(which are accounted for on a fair value basis).An election was not

made for short-term agreements,as the carrying value for such

agreements generally approximates fair value.For additional infor-

mation regarding these agreements,see Note 13 on pages

174Œ175 of this Annual Report.
In the second quarter of 2008,the Firm began electing the fair value
option for newly transacted securities borrowed and securities lend-

ing agreements with a maturity of greater than one year.An election

was not made for any short-term agreements,as the carrying value

for such agreements generally approximates fair value.
Structured NotesIB issues structured notes as part of its client-driven activities.

Structured notes are financial instruments that contain embedded
derivatives and are included in long-term debt.On January 1,2007,

the Firm elected to record at fair value all structured notes not previ-

ously elected or eligible for election under SFAS 155.The election

was made to mitigate the volatility due to the differences in the

measurement basis for structured notes and the associated risk man-
agement arrangements as well as to eliminate the operational bur-

dens of having different accounting models for the same type of
financial instrument.OtherIn the third quarter of 2008,the Firm elected the fair value option

for the ABCP investments purchased under the Federal Reserve™s

AML Facility for U.S.money market mutual funds,as well as the

related nonrecourse advance from the Federal Reserve Bank of

Boston (ﬁFRBBﬂ).At December 31,2008,ABCP investments of

$11.2 billion were recorded in other assets;the corresponding non-

recourse liability to the FRBB in the same amount was recorded in

other borrowed funds.For further discussion,see Note 21 on page

202 of this Annual Report.
In 2008,the Firm elected the fair value option for certain loans
acquired as part of the Bear Stearns merger that were included in
the trading portfolio and for prime mortgages previously designated

as held-for-sale by Washington Mutual as part of the Washington

Mutual transaction.In addition,the Firm elected the fair value option

for certain tax credit and other equity investments acquired as part
of the Washington Mutual transaction.

157Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended De
cember 31,2008 and 2007,for items for which the fair value election was made.The profit and loss information presented below only include
s the financialinstruments that were elected to be measured at fair value;related risk management instruments,which are required to be measure
d at fairvalue,are not included in the table.
†Long-term debt:Changes in value attributable to instrument-spe-
cific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes

in the Firm™s credit spread.The gain for 2008 and 2007 was

attributable to the widening of the Firm™s credit spread.
†Resale and repurchase agreements,securities borrowed agree-
ments and securities lending agreements:Generally,for these

types of agreements,there is a requirement that collateral be

maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the prin-

cipal amount loaned;as a result,there would be no adjustment

or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk

related to these agreements.

includes adjustments for structured notes classified within deposits and other borrowed funds,as well as long-term debt.
(b)Structured notes are debt instruments with embedded derivatives that are tailored to meet a client™s need for derivative ris
k in funded form.The embedded derivative is the primary
driver of risk.The 2008 gain included in ﬁOther changes in fair valueﬂresults from a significant decline in the value of certai
n structured notes where the embedded derivative is prin-
cipally linked to either equity indices or commodity prices,both of which declined sharply during the second half of 2008.Altho
ugh the risk associated with the structured notes isactively managed,the balance reported in this table does not include the income statement impact of such risk management instru
ments.
(c)Included in the amounts are gains and losses related to certain financial instruments previously carried at fair value by th
e Firm,such as structured liabilities elected pursuant to SFAS
155 and loans purchased as part of the Investment Bank™s trading activities.
(d)Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(e)Reported in other income.
Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items
for which a fair value election was made

The following describes how the gains and losses included in earn-

ings during 2008 and 2007,which were attributable to changes in

instrument-specific credit risk,were determined.
†Loans and lending-related commitments:For floating-rate instru-
ments,all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific

credit risk.For fixed-rate instruments,an allocation of the

changes in value for the period is made between those changes

in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that

are credit-related.Allocations are generally based upon an analy-

sis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information,

where available,or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.
Notes to consolidated financial statements158JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
The contractual amount of unfunded lending-related commitments
for which the fair value option was elected was negligible at

December 31,2008.At December 31,2007,the contractual amount

of unfunded lending-related commitments for which the fair value

option was elected was $1.0 billion with a corresponding fair value

of $25 million.Such commitments are reflected as liabilities and

included in accounts payable and other liabilities.
Note 6 Œ Principal transactions
Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized

gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodi-

ties inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair
value),changes in fair value associated with financial instruments

held by the Investment Bank for which the SFAS 159 fair value option

was elected,and loans held-for-sale within the wholesale lines of

business.For loans measured at fair value under SFAS 159,origina-

tion costs are recognized in the associated expense category as
incurred.Principal transactions revenue also includes private equity

gains and losses.

Trading assets and liabilities
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments held for trading

purposes that JPMorgan Chase owns (ﬁlongﬂpositions),certain

loans for which the Firm manages on a fair value basis and has

elected the SFAS 159 fair value option,and physical commodities

inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments that the Firm

has sold to other parties but does not own (ﬁshortﬂpositions).The

Firm is obligated to purchase instruments at a future date to cover
the short positions.Included in trading assets and trading liabilities

are the reported receivables (unrealized gains) and payables (unreal-

ized losses) related to derivatives.Trading assets and liabilities are

carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For a dis-

cussion of the valuation of trading assets and trading liabilities,see

(a)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal protected notes.Unlike principal protected notes for which
 the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of princi-
pal at the maturity of the note,nonprincipal protected notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at
 maturity but to return an amount based upon the per-
formance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note.
(b) Where the Firm issues principal protected zero coupon or discount notes,the balance reflected as the remaining contractual 
principal is the final principal payment at maturity.

159Included in trading assets and trading liabilities are the reported
receivables (unrealized gains) and payables (unrealized losses) relat-

ed to derivatives.As permitted under FIN 39,the Firm has elected to

net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related

cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master

netting agreement exists.The netted amount of cash collateral

received and paid was $103.6 billion and $72.4 billion,respectively,

at December 31,2008,and $34.9 billion and $24.6 billion,respec-

tively,at December 31,2007.The Firm received and paid excess col-

lateral of $22.2 billion and $3.7 billion,respectively,at December 31,

2008,and $17.4 billion and $2.4 billion,respectively,at December

31,2007.This additional collateral received and paid secures poten-

tial exposure that could arise in the derivatives portfolio should the

mark-to-market of the transactions move in the Firm™s favor or the

client™s favor,respectively,and is not nettable against the derivative

receivables or payables in the table above.The above amounts also

exclude liquid securities held and posted as collateral by the Firm to

secure derivative receivables and derivative payables.Collateral

amounts held and posted in securities form are not recorded on the
Firm's balance sheet,and are therefore not nettable against derivative

receivables.The Firm held securities collateral of $19.8 billion and

$9.8 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,related to

derivative receivables.The Firm posted $11.8 billion and $5.9 billion

of securities collateral at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,

related to derivative payables.

Investment banking fees
This revenue category includes advisory and equity and debt under-

writing fees.Advisory fees are recognized as revenue when the related

services have been performed.Underwriting fees are recognized as

revenue when the Firm has rendered all services to the issuer and is
entitled to collect the fee from the issuer,as long as there are no other

contingencies associated with the fee (e.g.,the fee is not contingent

upon the customer obtaining financing).Underwriting fees are net of

syndicate expense;the Firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndi-

cation fees as revenue after satisfying certain retention,timing and

yield criteria.The following table presents the components of Investment banking fees.

Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category primarily reflects Retail Financial Services™

mortgage banking revenue,including:fees and income derived from

mortgages originated with the intent to sell;mortgage sales and

servicing;the impact of risk management activities associated with

the mortgage pipeline,warehouse loans and MSRs;and revenue

related to any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations.

This revenue category also includes gains and losses on sales and

lower of cost or fair value adjustments for mortgage loans held-for-

sale,as well as changes in fair value for mortgage loans originated

with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under SFAS 159.

For loans measured at fair value under SFAS 159,origination costs

are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.
Costs to originate loans held-for-sale and accounted for at the

lower of cost or fair value are deferred and recognized as a compo-

nent of the gain or loss on sale.Net interest income from mortgage

loans and securities gains and losses on available-for-sale (ﬁAFSﬂ)

securities used in mortgage-related risk management activities are

recorded in interest income and securities gains (losses),respectively.

For a further discussion of MSRs,see Note 18 on pages 199Œ200 of

this Annual Report.
Credit card income
This revenue category includes interchange income from credit and

debit cards and servicing fees earned in connection with securitiza-
tion activities.Volume-related payments to partners and expense for

rewards programs are netted against interchange income;expense

related to rewards programs are recorded when the rewards are

earned by the customer,as more fully described below.Other fee rev-

enue is recognized as earned,except for annual fees,which are

deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 12-month

period to which they pertain.Direct loan origination costs are also

deferred and recognized over a 12-month period.In addition,due to

the consolidation of Chase Paymentech Solutions in the fourth quar-

ter of 2008,this category now includes net fees earned for process-

ing card transactions for merchants.

161Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous affinity organiza-
tions and co-brand partners,which grant the Firm exclusive rights to

market to the members or customers of such organizations and part-

ners.These organizations and partners endorse the credit card pro-

grams and provide their mailing lists to the Firm,and they may also

conduct marketing activities and provide awards under the various

credit card programs.The terms of these agreements generally range

from three to ten years.The economic incentives the Firm pays to the

endorsing organizations and partners typically include payments based
upon new account originations,charge volumes,and the cost of the

endorsing organizations™ or partners™ marketing activities and awards.
The Firm recognizes the payments made to the affinity organizations
and co-brand partners based upon new account originations as

direct loan origination costs.Payments based upon charge volumes

are considered by the Firm as revenue sharing with the affinity
organizations and co-brand partners,which are deducted from inter-

change income as the related revenue is earned.Payments based

upon marketing efforts undertaken by the endorsing organization or

partner are expensed by the Firm as incurred.These costs are record-

ed within noninterest expense.

Note 9 Œ Pension and other postretirement
employee benefit plansThe Firm™s defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accor-
dance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 88,and its other postretirement

employee benefit (ﬁOPEBﬂ) plans are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS 106.In September 2006,the FASB issued SFAS 158,

which requires companies to recognize on their Consolidated
Balance Sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of their
defined benefit postretirement plans,measured as the difference

between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.

SFAS 158 requires unrecognized amounts (e.g.,net loss and prior

service costs) to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) (ﬁAOCIﬂ) and that these amounts be adjusted as they

are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost based upon the current amortization and recognition require-
ments of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106.The Firm prospectively adopted

SFAS 158 on December 31,2006,and recorded an after-tax charge

to AOCI of $1.1 billion at that date.
SFAS 158 also eliminates the provisions of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106
that allow plan assets and obligations to be measured as of a date
not more than three months prior to the reporting entity™s balance

sheet date.The Firm uses a measurement date of December 31 for

its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans;therefore,this provision

of SFAS 158 had no effect on the Firm™s financial statements.
For the Firm™s defined benefit pension plans,fair value is used to
determine the expected return on plan assets.For the Firm™s OPEB

plans,a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a

five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan
assets.Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net

periodic benefit cost if,as of the beginning of the year,the net gain

or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the fair value of the plan assets.Any excess,as well as

prior service costs,are amortized over the average future service

period of defined benefit pension plan participants,which for the

U.S.defined benefit pension plan is currently nine years (the

decrease of one year from the prior year in the assumptions is relat-
ed to pension plan demographic assumption revisions at December

31,2007,to reflect recent experience relating to the form and timing

of benefit distributions and rates of turnover).For OPEB plans,any

excess net gains and losses also are amortized over the average

future service period,which is currently six years;however,prior serv-

ice costs are amortized over the average years of service remaining

to full eligibility age,which is currently four years.The amortization

periods for net gains and losses and prior service costs for OPEB are
unchanged from the prior year.
Notes to consolidated financial statements162JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Defined benefit pension plans The Firm has a qualified noncontributory U.S.defined benefit pension

plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S.employees.The

U.S.plan employs a cash balance formula in the form of pay and

interest credits to determine the benefits to be provided at retire-
ment,based upon eligible compensation and years of service.

Employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of
service,and beginning January 1,2008,benefits generally vest after

three years of service.The Firm also offers benefits through defined

benefit pension plans to qualifying employees in certain non-U.S.

locations based upon factors such as eligible compensation,age

and/or years of service.
It is the Firm™s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient
to meet the requirements under applicable employee benefit and
local tax laws.On January 15,2009,the Firm made a discretionary

cash contribution to its U.S.defined benefit pension plan of $1.3 bil-

lion,funding the plan to the maximum allowable amount under

applicable tax law.The expected amount of 2009 contributions to its

non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans is $44 million,of which $20

million is contractually required.The amount of potential 2009 con-

tributions to the United Kingdom (ﬁU.K.ﬂ) defined benefit plans is

not reasonably estimable at this time.
JPMorgan Chase also has a number of defined benefit pension plansnot subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security

Act.The most significant of these plans is the Excess Retirement

Plan,pursuant to which certain employees earn pay and interest

credits on compensation amounts above the maximum stipulated by
law under a qualified plan.The Excess Retirement Plan had an

unfunded projected benefit obligation in the amount of $273 million
and $262 million,at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.
Defined contribution plansJPMorgan Chase offers several defined contribution plans in the U.S.

and in certain non-U.S.locations,all of which are administered in

accordance with applicable local laws and regulations.The most sig-

nificant of these plans is The JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan

(the ﬁ401(k) Savings Planﬂ),which covers substantially all U.S.

employees.The 401(k) Savings Plan allows employees to make pre-

tax and Roth 401(k) contributions to tax-deferred investment portfo-
lios.The JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund,which is an invest-

ment option under the 401(k) Savings Plan,is a nonleveraged

employee stock ownership plan.The Firm matches eligible employee

contributions up to a certain percentage of benefits-eligible compen-
sation per pay period,subject to plan and legal limits.Employees

begin to receive matching contributions after completing a one-year-

of-service requirement and are immediately vested in the Firm™s con-

tributions when made.Employees with total annual cash compensa-

tion of $250,000 or more are not eligible for matching contributions.

The 401(k) Savings Plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing con-

tributions by participating companies for certain employees,subject

to a specified vesting schedule.
OPEB plansJPMorgan Chase offers postretirement medical and life insurance

benefits to certain retirees and postretirement medical benefits to

qualifying U.S.employees.These benefits vary with length of service

and date of hire and provide for limits on the Firm™s share of covered

medical benefits.The medical benefits are contributory,while the life

insurance benefits are noncontributory.Postretirement medical bene-

fits also are offered to qualifying U.K.employees.
JPMorgan Chase™s U.S.OPEB obligation is funded with corporate-
owned life insurance (ﬁCOLIﬂ) purchased on the lives of eligible

employees and retirees.While the Firm owns the COLI policies,COLI

proceeds (death benefits,withdrawals and other distributions) may

be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit

claim payments and related administrative expense.The U.K.OPEB

plan is unfunded.www.global-reports.com

Plan assumptions JPMorgan Chase™s expected long-term rate of return for U.S.defined

benefit pension and OPEB plan assets is a blended average of the

investment advisor™s projected long-term (10 years or more) returns for

the various asset classes,weighted by the asset allocation.Returns on

asset classes are developed using a forward-looking building-block

approach and are not strictly based upon historical returns.Equity

returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation,expected real

earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield.Bond returns

are generally developed as the sum of inflation,real bond yield and
risk spread (as appropriate),adjusted for the expected effect on returns
from changing yields.Other asset-class returns are derived from their

relationship to the equity and bond markets.Consideration was also

given to current market conditions and the short-term portfolio mix of

each Plan;as a result,the Firm has generally maintained the same

expected return on assets from the prior year.
For the U.K.defined benefit pension plans,which represent the most
significant of the non-U.S.defined benefit pension plans,procedures

similar to those in the U.S.are used to develop the expected 
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
165long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets,tak-
ing into consideration local market conditions and the specific alloca-

tion of plan assets.The expected long-term rate of return on U.K.

plan assets is an average of projected long-term returns for each

asset class.The return on equities has been selected by reference to

the yield on long-term U.K.government bonds plus an equity risk

premium above the risk-free rate.The return on ﬁAAﬂ-rated long-term

corporate bonds has been taken as the average yield on such bonds,

adjusted for the expected downgrades and the expected narrowing

of credit spreads over the long term.The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under
the U.S.defined benefit pension and OPEB plans was selected by ref-

erence to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates andcoupons that closely match each of the plan™s projected cash flows;
such portfolios are derived from a broad-based universe of high-
quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date.In years in

which these hypothetical bond portfolios generate excess cash,such

excess is assumed to be reinvested at the one-year forward rates

implied by the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve published as of the

measurement date.The discount rate for the U.K.defined benefit

pension and OPEB plans represents a rate implied from the yield

curve of the year-end iBoxx £ corporate ﬁAAﬂ15-year-plus bond

index (adjusted for expected downgrades in the underlying bonds

comprising the index) with a duration corresponding to that of the

underlying benefit obligations.

Notes to consolidated financial statements166JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
At December 31,2008,the Firm increased the discount rates used to
determine its benefit obligations for the U.S.defined benefit pension

and OPEB plans based upon current market interest rates,which will

result in a decrease in expense of approximately $1.6 million for

2009.The 2009 expected long-term rate of return on U.S.pension

plan assets and U.S.OPEB plan assets remained at 7.5% and 7.0%,

respectively.The health care benefit obligation trend assumption

declined from 9.25% in 2008 to 8.5% in 2009,declining to a rate of

5% in 2014.As of December 31,2008,the interest crediting rate

assumption and the assumed rate of compensation increase

remained at 5.25% and 4.0%,respectively.
JPMorgan Chase™s U.S.defined benefit pension and OPEB plan
expense is sensitive to the expected long-term rate of return on plan

assets and the discount rate.With all other assumptions held con-

stant,a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of

return on U.S.plan assets would result in an increase of approxi-

mately $23 million in 2009 U.S.defined benefit pension and OPEB

plan expense.A 25-basis point decline in the discount rate for the

U.S.plans would result in an increase in 2009 U.S.defined benefit

pension and OPEB plan expense of approximately $9 million and an

increase in the related projected benefit obligations of approximately

$159 million.A 25-basis point decline in the discount rates for the

non-U.S.plans would result in an increase in the 2009 non-U.S.

defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense of approximately

$10 million.A 25-basis point increase in the interest crediting rate

for the U.S.defined benefit pension plan would result in an increase

in 2009 U.S.defined benefit pension expense of approximately $16

million and an increase in the related projected benefit obligations of
approximately $66 million.
Investment strategy and asset allocation 
The investment policy for the Firm™s postretirement employee benefit

plan assets is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate
to the respective plan™s needs and goals,using a global portfolio of

various asset classes diversified by market segment,economic sector

and issuer.Specifically,the goal is to optimize the asset mix for

future benefit obligations,while managing various risk factors and

each plan™s investment return objectives.For example,long-duration

fixed income securities are included in the U.S.qualified pension

plan™s asset allocation,in recognition of its long-duration obligations.

Plan assets are managed by a combination of internal and external
investment managers and are rebalanced within approved ranges on

a continued basis.The Firm reviews the allocation daily and all fac-

tors that impact portfolio changes to ensure the Plan stays within
these ranges,rebalancing when deemed necessary.
The Firm™s U.S.defined benefit pension plan assets are held in trust
and invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equities (including U.S.

large and small capitalization and international equities),fixed

income (including corporate and government bonds,Treasury infla-

tion-indexed and high-yield securities),real estate,cash equivalents

and alternative investments.Non-U.S.defined benefit pension plan

assets are held in various trusts and similarly invested in well-diversi-

fied portfolios of equity,fixed income and other securities.Assets of

the Firm™s COLI policies,which are used to fund partially the U.S.

OPEB plan,are held in separate accounts with an insurance company

and are invested in equity and fixed income index funds.As of

December 31,2008,assets held by the Firm™s U.S.and non-U.S.

defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include JPMorgan
Chase common stock,except in connection with investments in

third-party stock-index funds.
The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair values of total plan assets at December 31 for t

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
167Note 10 Œ Employee stock-based incentives Effective January 1,2006,the Firm adopted SFAS 123R and all relat-
ed interpretations using the modified prospective transition method.

SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,includ-

ing employee stock options and stock appreciation rights (ﬁSARsﬂ),
to be measured at their grant date fair values.The Firm also adopted

the transition election provided by FSP FAS 123(R)-3.
Upon adopting SFAS 123R,the Firm began to recognize in the
Consolidated Statements of Income compensation expense for

unvested stock options previously accounted for under APB 25.

Additionally,JPMorgan Chase recognized as compensation expense

an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment resulting from the SFAS

123R requirement to estimate forfeitures at the grant date instead of

recognizing them as incurred.Finally,the Firm revised its accounting

policies for share-based payments granted to employees eligible for

continued vesting under specific age and service or service-related
provisions (ﬁfull-career eligible employeesﬂ) under SFAS 123R.Prior

to adopting SFAS 123R,the Firm™s accounting policy for share-based

payment awards granted to full-career eligible employees was to rec-

ognize compensation cost over the award™s stated service period.

Beginning with awards granted to full-career eligible employees in

2006,JPMorgan Chase recognized compensation expense on the

grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-

employment restrictions.In the first quarter of 2006,the Firm also

began to accrue the estimated cost of stock awards granted to full-

career eligible employees in the following year.
In June 2007,the FASB ratified EITF 06-11,which requires that real-
ized tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents paid on

equity-classified share-based payment awards that are charged to

retained earnings be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in
capital and included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to
absorb tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards.Prior to the
issuance of EITF 06-11,the Firm did not include these tax benefits

as part of this pool of excess tax benefits.The Firm adopted EITF

06-11 on January 1,2008.The adoption of this consensus did not

have an impact on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets or results

of operations.
In connection with the Bear Stearns merger,46 million Bear Stearns
employee stock awards,principally restricted stock units (ﬁRSUsﬂ),

capital appreciation plan units and stock options,were exchanged

for equivalent JPMorgan Chase awards using the merger exchange

ratio of 0.21753.The fair value of these employee stock awards was

included in the purchase price since substantially all of the awards

were fully vested immediately after the merger date under provisions
that provided for accelerated vesting upon a change of control of

Bear Stearns.However,Bear Stearns vested employee stock options

had no impact on the purchase price;since the employee stock

options were significantly out of the money at the merger date,the

fair value of these awards was equal to zero upon their conversion

into JPMorgan Chase options.
The Firm also exchanged 6 million shares of its common stock for 27
million shares of Bear Stearns common stock held in an irrevocable
grantor trust (the ﬁRSU Trustﬂ) using the merger exchange ratio of

0.21753.The RSU Trust was established to hold common stock

underlying awards granted to selected employees and key executives

under certain Bear Stearns employee stock plans.The RSU Trust was

consolidated on JPMorgan Chase™s Consolidated Balance Sheets as

of June 30,2008,and the shares held in the RSU Trust were record-

ed in ﬁShares held in RSU Trust,ﬂwhich reduced stockholders™ equity,

similar to the treatment for treasury stock.A related obligation to

issue stock under these employee stock plans is reported in capital
surplus.The issuance of shares held in the RSU Trust to employees

will not have any effect on the Firm™s total stockholders™ equity,net

uted in 2008 with approximately half of the shares in the RSU Trust

distributed in January 2009.The remaining shares are expected to be

distributed over the next four years.
Employee stock-based awards 
In 2008,2007 and 2006,JPMorgan Chase granted long-term stock-

based awards to certain key employees under the 2005 Long-Term

Incentive Plan (the ﬁ2005 Planﬂ).The 2005 Plan,plus prior Firm

plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions,constitute the

Firm™s stock-based incentive plans (ﬁLTI Planﬂ).The 2005 Plan

became effective on May 17,2005,after approval by shareholders at

the 2005 annual meeting.In May 2008,the 2005 Plan was amend-

ed and under the terms of the amended plan as of December 31,
2008,348 million shares of common stock are available for issuance

through May 2013.The amended 2005 Plan is the only active plan

under which the Firm is currently granting stock-based incentive

awards.
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant.RSUs
are generally granted annually and generally vest 50 percent after

two years and 50 percent after three years and convert to shares of
common stock at the vesting date.In addition,RSUs typically include

full-career eligibility provisions,which allow employees to continue to

vest upon voluntary termination,subject to post-employment and

other restrictions.All of these awards are subject to forfeiture until

the vesting date.An RSU entitles the recipient to receive cash pay-

ments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common

stock during the period the RSU is outstanding.Under the LTI Plan,stock options and SARs have been granted with
an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase™s com-

mon stock on the grant date.The Firm typically awards SARs to cer-

tain key employees once per year,and it also periodically grants dis-

cretionary stock-based incentive awards to individual employees,pri-

marily in the form of both employee stock options and SARs.The

2008 and 2007 grants of SARs to key employees vest ratably over

five years (i.e.,20% per year) and the 2006 awards vest one-third

after each of years three,four,and five.These awards do not include

any full-career eligibility provisions and all awards generally expire

ten years after the grant date.
The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each
tranche of each award as if it were a separate award with its own

vesting date.For each tranche granted (other than grants to employ-

ees who are full-career eligible at the grant date),compensation

expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date

until the vesting date of the respective tranche,provided that the

employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting
period.For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-

career eligible during the vesting period,compensation expense is

recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earli-

er of the employee™s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of

the respective tranche.
The Firm™s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee
stock-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of com-

mon stock or treasury shares.During 2008 and 2007,the Firm set-

tled all of its employee stock-based awards by issuing treasury

shares.During 2006,the Firm settled all of its employee stock-based

awards by issuing new shares of common stock from January 1

through May 31,2006,and by issuing treasury shares thereafter.
In January 2008,the Firm awarded to its Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer up to two million SARs.The terms of this award are

distinct from,and more restrictive than,other equity grants regularly

awarded by the Firm.The SARs,which have a ten-year term,will

become exercisable no earlier than January 22,2013,and have an

exercise price of $39.83,the price of JPMorgan Chase common stock

on the date of the award.The number of SARs that will become

exercisable (ranging from none to the full two million) and their

exercise date or dates may be determined by the Board of Directors
based on an assessment of the performance of both the CEO and
JPMorgan Chase.That assessment will be made by the Board in the

year prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the award,relying on

such factors that in its sole discretion the Board deems appropriate.

Due to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the number of SARs
that will ultimately be granted and their exercise dates,a grant date

has not been established for accounting purposes.However,since

the service inception date precedes the grant date,the Firm will rec-

ognize this award ratably over an assumed five-year service period,

subject to a requirement to recognize changes in the fair value of the

award through the grant date.The Firm recognized $1 million in

compensation expense in 2008 for this award.
RSU activity Compensation expense for RSUs is measured based upon the num-
ber of shares granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date

and is recognized in net income as previously described.The follow-

ing table summarizes JPMorgan Chase™s RSU activity for 2008.

intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December

million,respectively.
Impact of adoption of SFAS 123R 
During 2006,the incremental expense related to the Firm™s adoption

of SFAS 123R was $712 million.This amount represents an acceler-

ated noncash recognition of costs that would otherwise have been
incurred in future periods.Also,as a result of adopting SFAS 123R,

the Firm™s income from continuing operations (pretax) for the year

ended December 31,2006,was lower by $712 million,and each of

income from continuing operations (after-tax) and net income for the

year ended December 31,2006,was lower by $442 million,than if

the Firm had continued to account for stock-based incentives under
APB 25 and SFAS 123.Basic and diluted earnings per share from

continuing operations,as well as basic and diluted net income per

share,for the year ended December 31,2006 were $.13 and $.12

lower,respectively,than if the Firm had not adopted SFAS 123R.
Compensation expenseThe Firm recognized noncash compensation expense related to its vari-

ous employee stock-based incentive awards of $2.6 billion,$2.0 billion

and $2.4 billion (including the $712 million incremental impact of
adopting SFAS 123R) for the years ended December 31,2008,2007,

and 2006,respectively,in its Consolidated Statements of Income.

These amounts included an accrual for the estimated cost of stock

awards to be granted to full-career eligible employees of $409 million,

$500 million and $498 million for the years ended December 31,
2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.At December 31,2008,approxi-

mately $1.9 billion (pretax) of compensation cost related to unvested
awards has not yet been charged to net income.That cost is expected

to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average

period of 1.3 years.The Firm does not capitalize any compensation

cost related to share-based compensation awards to employees.
Cash flows and tax benefits The total income tax benefit related to stock-based incentive

arrangements recognized in the Firm™s Consolidated Statements of

Income for the years ended December 31,2008,2007 and 2006,

was $1.1 billion,$810 million and $947 million,respectively.

Expected dividend yield3.573.182.89
Expected common stock price volatility343323
Expected life (in years)6.86.86.8
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R,the Firm used the historical
volatility of its common stock price as the expected volatility assump-
tion in valuing options.The Firm completed a review of its expected

volatility assumption in 2006.Effective October 1,2006,JPMorgan

Chase began to value its employee stock options granted or modi-

fied after that date using an expected volatility assumption derived
from the implied volatility of its publicly traded stock options.
The expected life assumption is an estimate of the length of time
that an employee might hold an option or SAR before it is exercised
or canceled.The expected life assumption was developed using 

historic experience.
Employee stock option and SARs activity Compensation expense,which is measured at the grant date as the fair value of employee stock options and SARs,is recognized in 
net income asdescribed above.

Note 12 Œ Securities Securities are classified as AFS,held-to-maturity (ﬁHTMﬂ) or trading.
Trading securities are discussed in Note 6 on pages 158Œ160 of this

Annual Report.Securities are classified primarily as AFS when used

to manage the Firm™s exposure to interest rate movements,as well

as to make strategic longer-term investments.AFS securities are car-

ried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Unrealized

gains and losses,after any applicable SFAS 133 hedge accounting

adjustments,are reported as net increases or decreases to accumu-

lated other comprehensive income (loss).The specific identification

method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS secu-

rities,which are included in securities gains (losses) on the

Consolidated Statements of Income.Securities that the Firm has the

positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTMand are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated BalanceSheets.The Firm has not classified new purchases of securities as

HTM for the past several years.

AFS securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed in depth aspart of the Firm™s ongoing assessment of other-than-temporary

impairment.Potential other-than-temporary impairment of AFS secu-

rities is considered using a variety of factors,including the length of

time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer or

underlying collateral of a security;and the Firm™s intent and ability to

retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair
value.Where applicable under EITF Issue 99-20,the Firm estimates

the cash flows over the life of the security to determine if any
adverse changes have occurred that require an other-than-temporary

impairment charge.The Firm applies EITF Issue 99-20 to beneficial

interests in securitizations that are rated below ﬁAAﬂat acquisition

or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a

way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded

investment.The Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-

than-temporary if it is probable that the Firm will not recover its

recorded investment,including as applicable under EITF Issue 99-20,

when an adverse change in cash flows has occurred.The Firm™s analysis of the financial condition and near term prospects
of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security noted above

includes analysis of performance indicators relevant to the specific

investment.For asset-backed investments,such relevant performance

indicators may include ratings,valuation of subordinated positions in

current and/or stress scenarios,excess spread or overcollateralization
levels,and whether certain protective triggers have been reached.
For mortgage-backed investments,such relevant performance indica-

tors may include ratings,prepayment speeds,delinquencies,default

rates,loss severities,geographic concentration,and forecasted per-

formance under various home price decline stress scenarios.
As of December 31,2008,approximately $438 million of the unreal-
ized losses relate to securities that have been in an unrealized loss
position for longer than 12 months,and primarily relate to prime mort-

gage-backed securities and credit card-related asset-backed securities.

The prime mortgage-backed securities are primarily rated ﬁAAAﬂ,while

the credit card-related asset-backed securities are rated ﬁBBBﬂ.Based

upon the analyses described above,which have been applied to these

securities,the Firm believes that the unrealized losses result from liq-

uidity conditions in the current market environment and not from con-

cerns regarding the credit of the issuers or underlying collateral.The

Firm does not believe it is probable that it will not recover its invest-
ments,given the current levels of collateral and credit enhancements

that exist to protect the investments.For securities analyzed for impair-

ment under EITF 99-20,the collateral and credit enhancement features

are at levels sufficient to ensure that an adverse change in expected
future cash flows has not occurred.As of December 31,2008,approximately $6.2 billion of the unreal-
ized losses relate to securities that have been in an unrealized loss
position for less than 12 months;these losses largely relate to credit
Notes to consolidated financial statements174JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
card-related asset-backed securities,mortgage-backed securities
issued by private issuers and commercial and industrial asset-backed

securities.Of the $2.0 billion of unrealized losses related to credit

card-related asset-backed securities,$1.7 billion relates to purchased

credit card-related asset-backed securities,and $304 million relates

to retained interests in the Firm™s own credit card receivable securiti-

zations.The credit card-related asset-backed securities include

ﬁAAAﬂ,ﬁAﬂand ﬁBBBﬂratings.Based on the levels of excess spread

available to absorb credit losses,and based on the value of interests

subordinate to the Firm™s interests where applicable,the Firm does

not believe it is probable that it will not recover its investments.

Where applicable under EITF 99-20,the collateral and credit

enhancement features are at levels sufficient to ensure that an

adverse change in expected future cash flows has not occurred.Of

the remaining unrealized losses as of December 31,2008,related to

securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than12 months,$2.7 billion relates to mortgage-backed securities issued
by private issuers and $820 million relates to commercial and indus-

trial asset-backed securities.The mortgage-backed securities and

commercial and industrial asset-backed securities are predominantly

rated ﬁAAAﬂ.Based on an analysis of the performance indicators

noted above for mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securi-

ties,which have been applied to the loans underlying these securi-

ties,the Firm does not believe it is probable that it will not recover

its investments in these securities.
The Firm intends to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position
for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in
fair value or maturity.The Firm has sufficient capital and liquidity to

hold these securities until recovery in fair value or maturity.Based on

the Firm™s evaluation of the factors and other objective evidence

described above,the Firm believes that the securities are not other-

than-temporarily impaired as of December 31,2008.

Note 13 Œ Securities financing activitiesJPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements,repurchase agree-
ments,securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned trans-

actions,primarily to finance the Firm™s inventory positions,acquire

securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obliga-
tions.The Firm also enters into these transactions to accommodate

customers™ needs.
Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are generally treated
as collateralized financing transactions carried on the Consolidated

Balance Sheets at the amounts the securities will be subsequently
sold or repurchased,plus accrued interest.On January 1,2007,pur-

suant to the adoption of SFAS 159,the Firm elected fair value meas-

urement for certain resale and repurchase agreements.In 2008,the

Firm elected fair value measurement for certain newly transacted

securities borrowed and securities lending agreements.For a further

discussion of SFAS 159,see Note 5 on pages 156Œ158 of this

Annual Report.The securities financing agreements for which the fair

value option was elected continue to be reported within securities

purchased under resale agreements;securities loaned or sold under

repurchase agreements;securities borrowed;and other borrowed

funds on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Generally,for agreements
carried at fair value,current-period interest accruals are recorded
within interest income and interest expense,with changes in fair

value reported in principal transactions revenue.However,for finan-

cial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be sep-

arately accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133,all changes in

fair value,including any interest elements,are reported in principal

transactions revenue.Where appropriate,resale and repurchase

agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis
in accordance with FIN 41.JPMorgan Chase takes possession of

securities purchased under resale agreements.On a daily basis,

JPMorgan Chase monitors the market value of the underlying collat-

eral,primarily U.S.and non-U.S.government and agency securities,

that it has received from its counterparties,and requests additional

collateral when necessary.
Transactions similar to financing activities that do not meet the SFAS
140 definition of a repurchase agreement are accounted for as
ﬁbuysﬂand ﬁsellsﬂrather than financing transactions.These transac-

tions are accounted for as a purchase (sale) of the underlying securi-
ties with a forward obligation to sell (purchase) the securities.The

forward purchase (sale) obligation,a derivative,is recorded on the

Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value,with changes in fair

value recorded in principal transactions revenue.

JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to col-lateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings.

Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the secured party
are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various

parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At December 31,2008,the Firm received securities as collateral that
could be repledged,delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of

approximately $511.9 billion.This collateral was generally obtained

under resale or securities borrowing agreements.Of these securities,

approximately $456.6 billion were repledged,delivered or otherwise

used,generally as collateral under repurchase agreements,securities

lending agreements or to cover short sales.
Note 14 Œ LoansThe accounting for a loan may differ based upon whether it is origi-

nated or purchased and as to whether the loan is used in an invest-
ing or trading strategy.For purchased loans held-for-investment,the

accounting also differs depending on whether a loan is credit-
impaired at the date of acquisition.Purchased loans with evidence of

credit deterioration since the origination date and for which it is

probable,at acquisition,that all contractually required payments

receivable will not be collected are considered to be credit-impaired.

The measurement framework for loans in the Consolidated Financial

Statements is one of the following:†At the principal amount outstanding,net of the allowance for
loan losses,unearned income and any net deferred loan fees or

costs,for loans held for investment (other than purchased credit-

impaired loans);
†At the lower of cost or fair value,with valuation changes record-
ed in noninterest revenue,for loans that are classified as held-

for-sale;or
†At fair value,with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest
revenue,for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on

a fair value basis;
†Purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account-
ed for under SOP 03-3 and initially measured at fair value,which

includes estimated future credit losses.Accordingly,an allowance

for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the
acquisition date.
See Note 5 on pages 156Œ158 of this Annual Report for further
information on the Firm™s elections of fair value accounting under

SFAS 159.See Note 6 on pages 158Œ160 of this Annual Report for

further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as

trading assets.
For loans held for investment,other than purchased credit-impaired
loans,interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a

basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan.
Loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management
decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio.Transfers

to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the

date of transfer.Credit-related losses are charged off to the

allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates,

or exchange rates,are recognized in noninterest revenue.
Loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to
retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the

lower of cost or fair value.These loans are subsequently assessed for

impairment based on the Firm™s allowance methodology.For a fur-

ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm™s

allowance for loan losses,see Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this

Annual Report.Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis-continued.Loans (other than certain consumer and purchased credit-

impaired loans discussed below) are placed on nonaccrual status
immediately if,in the opinion of management,full payment of princi-

pal or interest is in doubt,or when principal or interest is 90 days or

more past due and collateral,if any,is insufficient to cover principal

and interest.Loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses

when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized.Interest

accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual
status is reversed against interest income.In addition,the amortiza-

tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended.Interest income on

nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in
cash.However,where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col-

lectibility of loan principal,all cash thereafter received is applied to

reduce the carrying value of such loans (i.e.,the cost recovery

method).Loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay-

ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured.Consumer loans,other than purchased credit-impaired loans,are
generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching

specified stages of delinquency,in accordance with the Federal

Financial Institutions Examination Council policy.For example,credit

card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the
account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv-
ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy,whichever is earlier.

Residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real-

izable value at no later than 180 days past due.Other consumer
Notes to consolidated financial statements176JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
products,if collateralized,are generally charged off to net realizable
value at 120 days past due.Accrued interest on residential mortgage

products,automobile financings,student loans and certain other con-

sumer loans are accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual
loan policy discussed in the preceding paragraph.Interest and fees

related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is
charged off or paid in full.Accrued interest on all other consumer

loans is generally reversed against interest income when the loan is

charged off.A collateralized loan is reclassified to assets acquired in

loan satisfactions,within other assets,only when JPMorgan Chase

has taken physical possession of the collateral,regardless of whether

formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place.
For purchased credit-impaired loans,the excess of the loan™s cash
flows expected to be collected over the initial fair value (i.e.,the acc-

retable yield) is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return

over the term of the loan,provided that the timing and amount of

future cash flows is reasonably estimable.On a periodic basis,the

Firm updates the amount of cash flows expected to be collected for
these loans,incorporating assumptions regarding default rates,loss

severities,the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors

that are reflective of current market conditions.Probable and signifi-

cant increases in cash flows previously expected to be collected
would first be used to reverse any related valuation allowance;any

remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income.

Probable decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date,

excluding decreases related to repricings of variable rate loans,are

recognized through the allowance for loan losses.Disposals of loans,

which may include sales of loans,receipt of payments in full by the

borrower,or foreclosure,result in removal of the loan from the SOP

03-3 portfolio.
With respect to purchased credit-impaired loans,when the timing
and/or amounts of expected cash flows on such loans are not rea-
sonably estimable,no interest is accreted and the loan is reported as

a nonperforming loan;otherwise,if the timing and amounts of

expected cash flows for purchased credit-impaired loans are reason-
ably estimable,then interest is accreted and the loans are reported

as performing loans.

Purchased credit-impaired loans
In connection with the Washington Mutual transaction,JPMorgan

Chase acquired certain loans that it deemed to be credit-impaired
under SOP 03-3.Wholesale loans with a carrying amount of $224

million at December 31,2008,were determined to be credit-

impaired at the date of acquisition in accordance with SFAS 114.

These wholesale loans are being accounted for individually (not on 

a pooled basis) and are reported as nonperforming loans since cash
flows for each individual loan are not reasonably estimable.Such

loans are excluded from the remainder of the following discussion,
which relates solely to purchased credit-impaired consumer loans.
Purchased credit-impaired consumer loans were determined to becredit-impaired based upon specific risk characteristics of the loan,

including product type,loan-to-value ratios,FICO scores,and past

due status.SOP 03-3 allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired

loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools,

provided that the loans have common risk characteristics.A pool is

then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest
rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.With respect to the

Washington Mutual transaction,all of the consumer loans were

aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.

impaired consumer loans at the acquisition date.

SOP 03-3.(c)Represents undiscounted principal and interest cash flows expected at acquisition.

(d)This amount is recognized into interest income over the estimated life of the underly-
ing loans.
The Firm determined the fair value of the purchased credit-impaired
consumer loans by discounting the cash flows expected to be collect-
ed at a market observable discount rate,when available,adjusted for

factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair

value.In determining the cash flows expected to be collected,man-

agement incorporated assumptions regarding default rates,loss

severities and the amounts and timing of prepayments.Contractually

required payments were determined following the same process used
to estimate cash flows expected to be collected,but without incorpo-

rating assumptions related to default rates and loss severities.
Purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in the Washington Mutual
transaction are reported in loans on the Firm™s Consolidated Balance

Sheets.Following the initial acquisition date of these loans,the

allowance for loan losses,if any is required,would be reported as a

reduction of the carrying amount of the loans.No allowance has

been recorded for these loans as of December 31,2008.The out-

standing balance and the carrying value of the purchased credit-

impaired consumer loans were as follows.

based on the current contractual rate of the underlying loans.

Impaired loans
A loan is considered impaired when,based upon current information
and events,it is probable that the Firm will be unable to collect all

amounts due (including principal and interest) according to the con-
tractual terms of the loan agreement.Impaired loans include certain

nonaccrual wholesale loans and loans for which a charge-off has
been recorded based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Impaired loans also include loans that have been modified in trou-
bled debt restructurings as a concession to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulties.Troubled debt restructurings typically result from

the Firm™s loss mitigation activities and could include rate reductions,

principal forgiveness,forbearance and other actions intended to min-

imize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of
collateral.When the Firm modifies home equity lines of credit in trou-

bled debt restructurings,future lending commitments related to the

modified loans are canceled as part of the terms of the modification.
Accordingly,the Firm does not have future commitments to lend

additional funds related to these modified loans.Purchased credit-

impaired loans are not required to be reported as impaired loans as
long as it is probable that the Firm expects to collect all cash flows
expected at acquisition,plus additional cash flows expected to be

collected arising from changes in estimates after acquisition.

Accordingly,none of the credit-impaired loans acquired in the

Washington Mutual transaction are reported in the following tables.
Interest income on impaired loans is recognized based on the Firm™s
policy for recognizing interest on accrual and nonaccrual loans.

Certain loans that have been modified through troubled debt restruc-
turings accrue interest under this policy.
Notes to consolidated financial statements178JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report

(b)In 2008,methodologies for calculating impaired loans have changed.Prior periods
have been revised to conform to current presentation.(c)When the discounted cash flows,collateral value or market price equals or exceeds
the carrying value of the loan,then the loan does not require an allowance under

SFAS 114.
(d)The allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 is included in JPMorgan Chase™s
allowance for loan losses.The allowance for certain consumer impaired loans has

been categorized in the allowance for loan losses as formula-based.
During 2008,loss mitigation efforts related to delinquent mortgage
and home equity loans increased substantially,resulting in a signifi-

cant increase in consumer troubled debt restructurings.In the fourth

quarter of 2008,the Firm announced plans to further expand loss

mitigation efforts related to these portfolios,including plans to open

regional counseling centers,hire additional loan counselors,intro-

duce new financing alternatives,proactively reach out to borrowers

to offer pre-qualified modifications,and commence a new process to

independently review each loan before moving it into the foreclosure
process.These loss mitigation efforts,which generally represent vari-

ous forms of term extensions,rate reductions and forbearances,are

expected to result in additional increases in the balance of modified
loans carried on the Firm™s balance sheet,including loans accounted

for as troubled debt restructurings,while minimizing the economic

loss to the Firm and providing alternatives to foreclosure.
JPMorgan Chase may modify the terms of its credit card loan agree-ments with borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty.Such

modifications may include canceling the customer™s available line of

credit on the credit card,reducing the interest rate on the card,and

placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60
months.If the cardholder does not comply with the modified terms,

then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its original
terms,with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the

appropriate delinquency ﬁbucketﬂand the loan amounts then

charged-off in accordance with the Firm™s standard charge-off policy.

Under these procedures,$2.4 billion and $1.4 billion of on-balance

sheet credit card loan outstandings have been modified at December
31,2008 and 2007,respectively.In accordance with the Firm™s

methodology for determining its consumer allowance for loan losses,

the Firm had already provisioned for these credit card loans;the

modifications to these credit card loans had no incremental impact
on the Firm™s allowance for loan losses.
Note 15 Œ Allowance for credit losses
During 2008,in connection with the Washington Mutual transaction,

the Firm recorded adjustments to its provision for credit losses in the
aggregate amount of $1.5 billion to conform the Washington Mutual

loan loss reserve methodologies to the appropriate JPMorgan Chase
methodology,based upon the nature and characteristics of the

underlying loans.This amount included an adjustment of $646 mil-

lion to the wholesale provision for credit losses and an adjustment of
$888 million to the consumer provision for credit losses.The Firm™s

methodologies for determining its allowance for credit losses,which

have been applied to the Washington Mutual loans,are described

more fully below.
JPMorgan Chase™s allowance for loan losses covers the wholesale
(risk-rated) and consumer (scored) loan portfolios and represents

management™s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the

Firm™s loan portfolio.Management also computes an allowance for

wholesale lending-related commitments using a methodology similar
to that used for the wholesale loans.
The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component
and a formula-based component.The asset-specific component

relates to provisions for losses on loans considered impaired and
measured pursuant to SFAS 114.An allowance is established when

the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market

price) of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.To

compute the asset-specific component of the allowance,larger

impaired loans are evaluated individually,and smaller impaired loans

are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the

respective class of assets.An allowance for loan losses will also be

recorded for purchased credit-impaired loans accounted for in accor-
dance with SOP 03-3 if there are probable decreases in expected
future cash flows other than decreases related to repricing of vari-

able rate loans.Any required allowance would be measured based

on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan™s

(or pool™s) effective interest rate.For additional information on pur-

chased credit-impaired loans,see Note 14 on pages 175Œ178 of this

Annual Report.www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
179The formula-based component covers performing wholesale and con-
sumer loans.For risk-rated loans (generally loans originated by the

wholesale lines of business),it is based on a statistical calculation,

which is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision,exter-

nal factors and current economic events that have occurred but are
not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calcula-
tion.The statistical calculation is the product of probability of default

(ﬁPDﬂ) and loss given default (ﬁLGDﬂ).These factors are differentiat-

ed by risk rating and expected maturity.PD estimates are based on

observable external data,primarily credit-rating agency default statis-

tics.LGD estimates are based on a study of actual credit losses over

more than one credit cycle.For scored loans (generally loans originat-

ed by the consumer lines of business),loss is primarily determined by

applying statistical loss factors,including loss frequency and severity

factors,to pools of loans by asset type.In developing loss frequency

and severity assumptions,known and anticipated changes in the eco-

nomic environment,including changes in housing prices,unemploy-

ment rates and other risk indicators,are considered.Multiple forecast-

ing methods are used to estimate statistical losses,including credit

loss forecasting models and vintage-based loss forecasting.Management applies its judgment within specified ranges to adjust
the statistical calculation.Where adjustments are made to the statis-

tical calculation for the risk-rated portfolios,the determination of the

appropriate point within the range are based upon management™s

quantitative and qualitative assessment of the quality of underwrit-
ing standards;relevant internal factors affecting the credit quality of

the current portfolio;and external factors such as current macroeco-

nomic and political conditions that have occurred but are not yet
reflected in the loss factors.Factors related to concentrated and

deteriorating industries are also incorporated into the calculation,

where relevant.Adjustments to the statistical calculation for the

scored loan portfolios are accomplished in part by analyzing the his-
torical loss experience for each major product segment.The specific

ranges and the determination of the appropriate point within the

range are based upon management™s view of uncertainties that

relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions,the quality

of underwriting standards,and other relevant internal and external

factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio.
The allowance for lending-related commitments represents manage-
ment™s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm™s

process of extending credit.Management establishes an asset-specif-

ic allowance for lending-related commitments that are considered

impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing

wholesale lending-related commitments.These are computed using a

methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio,

modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown.
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and
requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that
are inherently uncertain.Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfo-

lio,in light of the factors then prevailing,may result in significant

changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related com-

mitments in future periods.
At least quarterly,the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the
Chief Risk Officer,the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of

the Firm and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of

the Board of Directors of the Firm.As of December 31,2008,

JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be

appropriate (i.e.,sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the

portfolio,including those not yet identifiable).

Note 16 Œ Loan securitizations JPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety of loans,including resi-
dential mortgage,credit card,automobile,student,and commercial

loans (primarily related to real estate).JPMorgan Chase-sponsored

securitizations utilize SPEs as part of the securitization process.These

SPEs are structured to meet the definition of a QSPE (as discussed in
Note 1 on page 134 of this Annual Report);accordingly,the assets

and liabilities of securitization-related QSPEs are not reflected on the
Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets (except for retained interests,as

described below).The primary purpose of these securitization vehicles

is to meet investor needs and to generate liquidity for the Firm

through the sale of loans to the QSPEs.These QSPEs are financed

through the issuance of fixed,or floating-rate asset-backed securities.
The Firm records a loan securitization as a sale when the accounting
criteria for a sale are met.Those criteria are:(1) the transferred

assets are legally isolated from the Firm™s creditors;(2) the entity can

pledge or exchange the financial assets,or if the entity is a QSPE,its

investors can pledge or exchange their interests;and (3) the Firm

does not maintain effective control to repurchase the transferred

assets before their maturity or have the ability to unilaterally cause

the holder to return the transferred assets.
For loan securitizations that meet the accounting sales criteria,the
gains or losses recorded depend,in part,on the carrying amount of

the loans sold except for servicing assets which are initially recorded
at fair value.At the time of sale,any retained servicing asset is initially

recognized at fair value.The remaining carrying amount of the loans

sold is allocated between the loans sold and the other interests
retained,based upon their relative fair values on the date of sale.

Gains on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.
When quoted market prices are not available,the Firm estimates the
fair value for these retained interests by calculating the present

value of future expected cash flows using modeling techniques.

Such models incorporate management™s best estimates of key vari-

ables,such as expected credit losses,prepayment speeds and the

discount rates appropriate for the risks involved.See Note 4 on

page 144 of this Annual Report for further information on the valu-

ation of retained interests.
The Firm may retain interests in the securitized loans in the form of
undivided seller™s interest,senior or subordinated interest-only strips,

debt and equity tranches,escrow accounts and servicing rights.The

classification of retained interests is dependent upon several factors,

including the type of interest,whether or not the retained interest is

represented by a security certificate and when it was retained.Interests

retained by IB are classified as trading assets.See credit card securiti-

zations and mortgage securitizations sections of the note for further
information on the classification of their related retained interests.

Retained interests classified as AFS that are rated below ﬁAAﬂby an

external rating agency are subject to the impairment provisions of EITF

99-20,as discussed in Note 12 on page 174 of this Annual Report.

Notes to consolidated financial statements182JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Securitization activity by major product type
The following discussion describes the nature of the Firm™s securitiza-

tion activities by major product type.
Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Card Services (ﬁCSﬁ) business securitizes originated and pur-

chased credit card loans.The Firm™s primary continuing involvement

includes servicing the receivables,retaining an undivided seller™s

interest in the receivables,retaining certain senior and subordinated

securities and the maintenance of escrow accounts.
CS maintains servicing responsibilities for all credit card securitiza-tions that it sponsors.As servicer and transferor,the Firm receives

contractual servicing fees based upon the securitized loan balance

plus excess servicing fees,which are recorded in credit card income

as discussed in Note 7 on pages 160Œ161 of this Annual Report.
The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the
Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the trusts (which
generally ranges from 4% to 12%).At December 31,2008 and

2007,the Firm had $33.3 billion and $18.6 billion,respectively,

related to its undivided interests in the trusts.The Firm maintained

an average undivided interest in principal receivables in the trusts of

approximately 22% and 19% for the years ended December 31,

2008 and 2007,respectively.These undivided interests in the trusts

represent the Firm™s undivided interests in the receivables transferred

to the trust that have not been securitized;these undivided interests

are not represented by security certificates,are carried at historical

cost,and are classified within loans.
Additionally,the Firm retained subordinated interest in accrued inter-
est and fees on the securitized receivables totaling $3.0 billion and

$2.7 billion (net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts) as of

December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,which are classified in

other assets.
The Firm retained subordinated securities in credit card securitization
trusts totaling $2.3 billion and $284 million at December 31,2008

and 2007,respectively,and senior securities totaling $3.5 billion at

December 31,2008.Of the securities retained,$5.4 billion and $284

million were classified as AFS securities at December 31,2008 and

2007,respectively.Securities of $389 million that were acquired in

the Washington Mutual Bank transaction were classified as trading

assets at December 31,2008.The senior AFS securities were used by

the Firm as collateral for a secured financing transaction.
The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits
for some credit card securitizations to cover deficiencies in cash
flows owed to investors.The amounts available in such escrow

accounts related to credit cards are recorded in other assets and
amounted to $74 million and $97 million as of December 31,2008

and 2007,respectively.
Mortgage Securitizations The Firm securitizes originated and purchased residential mortgages

and originated commercial mortgages.
RFS securitizes residential mortgage loans that it originates and pur-chases and it typically retains servicing for all of its originated and
purchased residential mortgage loans.Additionally,RFS may retain

servicing for certain mortgage loans purchased by IB.As servicer,the

Firm receives servicing fees based upon the securitized loan balance

plus ancillary fees.The Firm also retains the right to service the resi-

dential mortgage loans it sells to the Government National
Mortgage Association (ﬁGNMAﬂ),Federal National Mortgage

Association (ﬁFannie Maeﬂ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage

Corporation (ﬁFreddie Macﬂ) in accordance with their servicing

guidelines and standards.For a discussion of MSRs,see Note 18 on

pages 199Œ200 of this Annual Report.In a limited number of secu-

ritizations,RFS may retain an interest in addition to servicing rights.

The amount of interest retained related to these securitizations

totaled $939 million and $221 million at December 31,2008 and

2007,respectively.These retained interests are accounted for as

trading or AFS securities;the classification depends on whether the

retained interest is represented by a security certificate,has an

embedded derivative,and when it was retained (i.e.,prior to the

adoption of SFAS 155).
IB securitizes residential mortgage loans (including those that it pur-chased and certain mortgage loans originated by RFS) and commer-
cial mortgage loans that it originated.Upon securitization,IB may

engage in underwriting and trading activities of the securities issued

by the securitization trust.IB may retain unsold senior and/or subor-

dinated interests (including residual interests) in both residential and
commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization.

These retained interests are accounted for at fair value and classified

as trading assets.The amount of residual interests retained was $155

million and $547 million at December 31,2008 and 2007,respec-

tively.Additionally,IB retained $2.8 billion of senior and subordinat-

ed interests as of December 31,2008;these securities were retained

at securitization in connection with the Firm™s underwriting activity.
In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activitytables below,the Firm sold residential mortgage loans totaling

$122.0 billion,$81.8 billion and $53.7 billion during the years

ended December 31,2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.The majori-

ty of these loan sales were for securitization by the GNMA,Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac.These sales resulted in pretax gains of $32

million,$47 million and $251 million,respectively.
The Firm™s mortgage loan sales are primarily nonrecourse,thereby
effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser

of the loans.However,for a limited number of loan sales,the Firm is

obligated to share up to 100% of the credit risk associated with the
sold loans with the purchaser.See Note 33 on page 221 of this

Annual Report for additional information on loans sold with recourse.

The Firm also securitizes automobile and student loans originated by
RFS and purchased consumer loans (including automobile and stu-
dent loans).The Firm retains servicing responsibilities for all originated

and certain purchased student and automobile loans.It may also hold

a retained interest in these securitizations;such residual interests are

classified as other assets.At December 31,2008 and 2007,the Firm

held $37 million and $85 million,respectively,of retained interests in

securitized automobile loans and $52 million and $55 million,respec-

tively,of retained interests in securitized student loans.
The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits
for some automobile and student loan securitizations to cover deficien-
cies in cash flows owed to investors.These escrow accounts are classi-

fied within other assets and carried at fair value.The amounts available

in such escrow accounts as of December 31,2008,were $3 million for

both automobile and student loan securitizations;as of December 31,

2007,these amounts were $21 million and $3 million for automobile

and student loan securitizations,respectively.

folio.Excluding these retained interests,the range of assumptions used to value the prime/Alt A mortgage retained interests wou

porated into other assumptions.
(f)Including the loss assumptions used to determine the fair value for a limited amount of retained interests resulted in a wid
er range than those used for the majority of the portfolio.
Excluding these retained interests,the range of loss assumption used to value the subprime mortgage retained interests would ha
ve been 0.2-43.5%.(g)The valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value for a limited amount of retained interests were higher than the m
ajority of the portfolio.Excluding these retained interests,
the range of assumptions used to value the commercial and other retained interests would have been 0.0-22.0% for prepayment rat
es and 3.3-30.4% for the discount rates.
The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical.
Changes in fair value based upon a 10% or 20% variation in

assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because the

relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair
value may not be linear.Also,in the table,the effect that a change in

a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated
without changing any other assumption.In reality,changes in one
factor may result in changes in another,which might counteract or

magnify the sensitivities.The above sensitivities also do not reflect

the Firm™s risk management practices that may be undertaken to mit-

igate such risks.

Notes to consolidated financial statements188JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Subprime adjustable-rate mortgage loan modifications 
See the Glossary of Terms on page 232 of this Annual Report for the

Firm™s definition of subprime loans.Within the confines of the limit-

ed decision-making abilities of a QSPE under SFAS 140,the operat-

ing documents that govern existing subprime securitizations gener-
ally authorize the servicer to modify loans for which default is rea-
sonably foreseeable,provided that the modification is in the best

interests of the QSPE™s beneficial interest holders and would not

result in a REMIC violation.In December 2007,the American Securitization Forum (ﬁASFﬂ) issued
the ﬁStreamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for

Securitized Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loansﬂ(the

ﬁFrameworkﬂ).The Framework provides guidance for servicers to

streamline evaluation procedures for borrowers with certain subprime

adjustable rate mortgage (ﬁARMﬂ) loans to more efficiently provide

modifications of such loans with terms that are more appropriate for
the individual needs of such borrowers.The Framework applies to all

first-lien subprime ARM loans that have a fixed rate of interest for an

initial period of 36 months or less,are included in securitized pools,

were originated between January 1,2005,and July 31,2007,and

have an initial interest rate reset date between January 1,2008,and

July 31,2010 (ﬁASF Framework Loansﬂ).
The Framework categorizes the population of ASF Framework Loans
into three segments:Segment 1 includes loans where the borrower

is current and is likely to be able to refinance into any readily avail-

able mortgage product;Segment 2 includes loans where the bor-

rower is current,is unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily

available mortgage industry product and meets certain defined crite-

ria;and Segment 3 includes loans where the borrower is not cur-

rent,as defined,and does not meet the criteria for Segments 1 or 2.
ASF Framework Loans in Segment 2 of the Framework are eligible
for fast-track modification under which the interest rate will be kept

at the existing initial rate,generally for five years following the

interest rate reset date.The Framework indicates that for Segment 2

loans,JPMorgan Chase,as servicer,may presume that the borrower

will be unable to make payments pursuant to the original terms of

the borrower™s loan after the initial interest rate reset date.Thus,the

Firm may presume that a default on that loan by the borrower is
reasonably foreseeable unless the terms of the loan are modified.
JPMorgan Chase has adopted the loss mitigation approaches under
the Framework for securitized subprime ARM loans that meet the

specific Segment 2 criteria and began modifying Segment 2 loans
during the first quarter of 2008.The adoption of the Framework did

not affect the off-balance sheet accounting treatment of JPMorgan
Chase-sponsored QSPEs that hold Segment 2 subprime loans.
The total dollar amount of assets owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs
that hold subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans as of December

31,2008 and 2007,was $30.8 billion and $20.0 billion,respectively.

Of these amounts,$12.7 billion and $9.7 billion,respectively,are

related to ASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm.Included within

the assets owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs was foreclosure-related
real estate owned,for which JPMorgan Chase is the servicer,in the
amount of $3.5 billion and $637 million at December 31,2008 and

2007,respectively.The growth in real estate owned in 2008 is

attributable to the Washington Mutual transaction and increased

foreclosures resulting from current housing market conditions.The

following table presents the principal amounts of ASF Framework

Loans,serviced by the Firm,that are owned by Firm-sponsored

QSPEs that fell within Segments 1,2 and 3 as of December 31,

2008 and 2007,respectively.

The estimates of segment classification could change substantially in
the future as a result of future changes in housing values,economic

conditions,borrower/investor behavior and other factors.
The total principal amount of beneficial interests issued by the Firm-
sponsored securitizations that hold ASF Framework Loans as of

December 31,2008 and 2007,was as follows.

For those ASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm and owned by
Firm-sponsored QSPEs,the Firm modified principal amounts of $1.7

billion of Segment 2 subprime mortgages during the year ended
December 31,2008.There were no Segment 2 subprime mortgages

modified during the year ended December 31,2007.For Segment 3

loans,the Firm has adopted a loss mitigation approach,without

employing the fast-track modifications prescribed for Segment 2 

subprime mortgages,that is intended to maximize the recoveries of

the securitization trust.The loss mitigation approach chosen by

JPMorgan Chase is consistent with the applicable servicing agree-
ments and could include rate reductions,principal forgiveness,for-

bearance and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and

avoid foreclosure.The table below presents selected information

relating to the principal amount of Segment 3 loans for the year
ended December 31,2008,including those that have been modified,

subjected to other loss mitigation activities or have been prepaid by
the borrower.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
189Note 17 Œ Variable interest entities
Refer to Note 1 on page 134 of this Annual Report for a further
description of JPMorgan Chase™s policies regarding consolidation of

variable interest entities.
JPMorgan Chase™s principal involvement with VIEs occurs in the fol-
lowing business segments:†Investment Bank:Utilizes VIEs to assist clients in accessing the
financial markets in a cost-efficient manner.IB is involved with

VIEs through multi-seller conduits and for investor intermedia-
tion purposes,as discussed below.IB also securitizes loans

through QSPEs,to create asset-backed securities,as further dis-

cussed in Note 16 on pages 180Œ188 of this Annual Report.
†Asset Management (ﬁAMﬂ):Provides investment management
services to a limited number of the Firm™s funds deemed VIEs.

AM earns a fixed fee based upon assets managed;the fee varies

with each fund™s investment objective and is competitively

priced.For the limited number of funds that qualify as VIEs,AM™s

relationships with such funds are not considered significant vari-

able interests under FIN 46(R).†Treasury & Securities Services:Provides services to a number of
VIEs that are similar to those provided to non-VIEs.TSS earns

market-based fees for the services it provides.The relationships

resulting from TSS™ services are not considered to be significant

variable interests under FIN 46(R).
†Commercial Banking (ﬁCBﬂ):Utilizes VIEs to assist clients in
accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner.This is

often accomplished through the use of products similar to those
offered in IB.CB may assist in the structuring and/or ongoing

administration of these VIEs and may provide liquidity,letters of

credit and/or derivative instruments in support of the VIE.The

relationships resulting from CB™s services are not considered to

be significant variable interests under FIN 46(R).
†Corporate/Private Equity:Corporate utilizes VIEs to issue guaran-
teed capital debt securities.See Note 23 on page 203 for further

information.The Private Equity business,also included in

Corporate,may be involved with entities that could be deemed

VIEs.Private equity activities are accounted for in accordance with

the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide 
Investment Companies (theﬁGuideﬂ).In June 2007,the AICPA issued SOP 07-1,which pro-

vides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the
scope of the Guide,and therefore qualifies to use the Guide™s spe-

cialized accounting principles (referred to as ﬁinvestment company

accountingﬂ).In May 2007,the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-7,

which amends FIN 46(R) to permanently exempt entities within the
scope of the Guide from applying the provisions of FIN 46(R) to
their investments.In February 2008,the FASB agreed to an indefi-

nite delay of the effective date of SOP 07-1 in order to address
implementation issues,which effectively delays FSP FIN 46(R)-7 as

well for those companies,such as the Firm,that have not adopted

SOP 07-1.Had FIN 46(R) been applied to VIEs subject to this

deferral,the impact would have been immaterial to the Firm™s con-

solidated financial statements as of December 31,2008.
As noted above,IB is predominantly involved with multi-seller con-
duits and VIEs associated with investor intermediation activities.These

nonconsolidated VIEs that are sponsored by JPMorgan Chase are dis-

cussed below.The Firm considers a ﬁsponsoredﬂVIE to include any

entity where:(1) JPMorgan Chase is the principal beneficiary of the

structure;(2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm

assets;(3) the VIE issues financial instruments associated with the

JPMorgan Chase brand name;or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase

administered ABCP conduit.
Multi-seller conduitsFunding and liquidityThe Firm is an active participant in the asset-backed securities busi-
ness,and it helps customers meet their financing needs by providing

access to the commercial paper markets through VIEs known as multi-

seller conduits.Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy-

remote entities that purchase interests in,and make loans secured by,

pools of receivables and other financial assets pursuant to agree-

ments with customers of the Firm.The conduits fund their purchases

and loans through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper to

third-party investors.The primary source of repayment of the commer-

cial paper is the cash flow from the pools of assets.In most instances,

the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements pro-
vided by the customers (i.e.,sellers) to the conduits or other third par-

ties.Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to

cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets,

and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the

seller,but also may include any combination of the following:

recourse to the seller or originator,cash collateral accounts,letters of

credit,excess spread,retention of subordinated interests or third-party

guarantees.The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm™s

potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.
JPMorgan Chase receives fees related to the structuring of multi-seller conduit transactions and compensation from the multi-seller

conduits for its role as administrative agent,liquidity provider,and

provider of program-wide credit enhancement.
As a means of ensuring timely repayment of the commercial paper,
each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100%
deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it.Deal-specific liquidi-

ty facilities are the primary source of liquidity support for the con-
duits.The deal-specific liquidity facilities are typically in the form of

asset purchase agreements and generally structured so the liquidity

that will be provided by the Firm as liquidity provider will be effect-
ed by the Firm purchasing,or lending against,a pool of nondefault-

ed,performing assets.
The conduit™s administrative agent can require the liquidity provider
to perform under its asset purchase agreement with the conduit at
any time.These agreements may cause the liquidity provider,includ-

ing the Firm,to purchase an asset from the conduit at an amount

above the asset™s then current fair value Œ in effect providing a

guarantee of the initial value of the reference asset as of the date of

the agreement.In limited circumstances,the Firm may provide

unconditional liquidity.
Notes to consolidated financial statements190JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
The Firm also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with pro-
gram-wide liquidity facilities in the form of uncommitted short-term

revolving facilities that can be accessed by the conduits to handle
funding increments too small to be funded by commercial paper and
in the form of uncommitted liquidity facilities that can be accessed

by the conduits only in the event of short-term disruptions in the
commercial paper market.
Because the majority of the deal-specific liquidity facilities will onlyfund nondefaulted assets,program-wide credit enhancement is

required to absorb losses on defaulted receivables in excess of loss-

es absorbed by any deal-specific credit enhancement.Program-wide

credit enhancement may be provided by JPMorgan Chase in the
form of standby letters of credit or by third-party surety bond
providers.The amount of program-wide credit enhancement

required varies by conduit and ranges between 5% and 10% of

applicable commercial paper outstanding.The following table presents information on the commitments and assets held by JPMorgan Chase™s administered multi-seller condu
its as ofDecember 31,2008 and 2007.

(b)The Firm™s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the amount of drawn commitments (i.e.,sellers™ assets held by the multi-se
ller conduits for which the Firm provides liquidity support)of $42.9 billion and $61.2 billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,plus contractual but undrawn commitments of $14.0 
billion and $27.7 billion at December 31,2008
and 2007,respectively.Since the Firm provides credit enhancement and liquidity to Firm-administered,multi-seller conduits,the m
aximum exposure is not adjusted to exclude exposurethat would be absorbed by third-party liquidity providers.
Assets funded by the multi-seller conduitsJPMorgan Chase™s administered multi-seller conduits fund a variety
of asset types for the Firm™s clients.Asset types primarily include

credit card receivables,auto loans,trade receivables,student loans,

commercial loans,residential mortgages,capital commitments (e.g.,

loans to private equity,mezzanine and real estate opportunity funds
secured by capital commitments of highly rated institutional
investors),and various other asset types.It is the Firm™s intention

that the assets funded by its administered multi-seller conduits be
sourced only from the Firm™s clients and not originated by,or trans-

ferred from,JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
191The assets held by the multi-seller conduits are structured so that if
they were rated,the Firm believes the majority of them would

receive an ﬁAﬂrating or better by external rating agencies.However,

it is unusual for the assets held by the conduits to be explicitly rated

by an external rating agency.Instead,the Firm™s Credit Risk group

assigns each asset purchase liquidity facility an internal risk-rating

based upon its assessment of the probability of default for the
transaction.The ratings provided in the above table reflect the S&P-

equivalent ratings of the internal rating grades assigned by the Firm.
The risk ratings are periodically reassessed as information becomes
available.As of December 31,2008 and 2007,90% and 93%,respec-

tively,of the assets in the conduits were risk-rated ﬁAﬂor better.
Commercial paper issued by the multi-seller conduits The weighted average life of commercial paper issued by the multi-

seller conduits at December 31,2008 and 2007,was 27 days and 26

days,respectively,and the average yield on the commercial paper at

December 31,2008 and 2007,was 0.6% and 5.7%,respectively.
In the normal course of business,JPMorgan Chase trades and
invests in commercial paper,including paper issued by the Firm-

administered conduits.The percentage of commercial paper pur-

chased by the Firm across all Firm-administered conduits during the
year ended December 31,2008,ranged from less than 1% to

approximately 20% on any given day.The largest daily amount of

commercial paper outstanding held by the Firm in any one multi-
seller conduit during the years ended December 31,2008 and

2007,was approximately $2.7 billion,or 23%,for 2008,and $2.7

billion,or 16%,for 2007,of the conduit™s commercial paper out-

standing.On average,the Firm held approximately 3% of daily

multi-seller conduit issued commercial paper outstanding during
2008.Total multi-seller conduit issued commercial paper held by the

Firm at December 31,2008 and 2007,was $360 million and $131

million,respectively.
The Firm is not obligated under any agreement (contractual or non-
contractual) to purchase the commercial paper issued by JPMorgan

Chase-administered conduits.

Notes to consolidated financial statements192JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Consolidation analysis The multi-seller conduits administered by the Firm were not consoli-
dated at December 31,2008 and 2007,because each conduit had

issued expected loss notes (ﬁELNsﬂ),the holders of which are com-

mitted to absorbing the majority of the expected loss of each
respective conduit.Implied support The Firm did not have and continues not to have any intent to pro-

tect any ELN holders from potential losses on any of the conduits™
holdings and has no plans to remove any assets from any conduit
unless required to do so in its role as administrator.Should such a

transfer occur,the Firm would allocate losses on such assets

between itself and the ELN holders in accordance with the terms of
the applicable ELN.
Expected loss modelingIn determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits the Firm uses
a Monte CarloŒbased model to estimate the expected losses of
each of the conduits and considers the relative rights and obliga-
tions of each of the variable interest holders.The Firm™s expected

loss modeling treats all variable interests,other than the ELNs,as its

own to determine consolidation.The variability to be considered in

the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the enti-
ty.The Firm™s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass

credit risk,not liquidity risk,to its variable interest holders,as the

assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term.Under FIN 46(R),the Firm is required to run the Monte Carlo-based
expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs.In

applying this guidance to the conduits,the following events,are

considered to be reconsideration events,as they could affect the

determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits:†New deals,including the issuance of new or additional variable
interests (credit support,liquidity facilities,etc);
†Changes in usage,including the change in the level of outstand-
ing variable interests (credit support,liquidity facilities,etc);
†Modifications of asset purchase agreements;and 

†Sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary.

From an operational perspective,the Firm does not run its Monte
Carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsideration

event due to the frequency of their occurrence.Instead,the Firm runs

its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assump-
tion for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of ELNs exists
for each conduit at any point during the quarter.
As part of its normal quarterly modeling,the Firm updates,when
applicable,the inputs and assumptions used in the expected loss

model.Specifically,risk ratings and loss given default assumptions are

continually updated.The total amount of expected loss notes out-

standing at December 31,2008 and 2007,were $136 million and

$130 million,respectively.Management has concluded that the model

assumptions used were reflective of market participants™ assumptions

and appropriately considered the probability of changes to risk ratings

and loss given defaults.
Qualitative considerations The multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an effi-

cient means for clients to access the commercial paper market.The

Firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties

and that the preponderance of the economic risk in the Firm™s multi-

seller conduits is not held by JPMorgan Chase.
Consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital The table below shows the impact on the Firm™s reported assets,lia-

bilities,Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio if the Firm were

required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that it admin-
isters at their current carrying value.

Tier 1 leverage ratio6.96.8
(a)The table shows the impact of consolidating the assets and liabilities of the multi-
seller conduits at their current carrying value;as such,there would be no income

statement or capital impact at the date of consolidation.If the Firm were required to

consolidate the assets and liabilities of the conduits at fair value,the Tier 1 capital

ratio would be approximately 10.8%.The fair value of the assets is primarily based

upon pricing for comparable transactions.The fair value of these assets could change

significantly because the pricing of conduit transactions is renegotiated with the

client,generally,on an annual basis and due to changes in current market conditions.
(b)Consolidation is assumed to occur on the first day of the quarter,at the quarter-end
levels,in order to provide a meaningful adjustment to average assets in the denomi-

nator of the leverage ratio.
The Firm could fund purchases of assets from VIEs should it
become necessary.
2007 activityIn July 2007,a reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by

prime residential mortgages held by a Firm-administered multi-seller
conduit was put to JPMorgan Chase under its deal-specific liquidity

facility.The asset was transferred to and recorded by JPMorgan

Chase at its par value based on the fair value of the collateral that

supported the reverse repurchase agreement.During the fourth

quarter of 2007,additional information regarding the value of the

collateral,including performance statistics,resulted in the determi-

nation by the Firm that the fair value of the collateral was impaired.

Impairment losses were allocated to the ELN holder (the party that
absorbs the majority of the expected loss from the conduit) in accor-
dance with the contractual provisions of the ELN note.
On October 29,2007,certain structured CDO assets originated in
the second quarter of 2007 and backed by subprime mortgages

were transferred to the Firm from two Firm-administered multi-seller

conduits.It became clear in October that commercial paper

investors and rating agencies were becoming increasingly concerned

about CDO assets backed by subprime mortgage exposures.

Because of these concerns,and to ensure the continuing viability of

the two conduits as financing vehicles for clients and as investment
alternatives for commercial paper investors,the Firm,in its role as

administrator,transferred the CDO assets out of the multi-seller con-

duits.The structured CDO assets were transferred to the Firm at
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
193their par value of $1.4 billion.As of December 31,2008 and 2007,
the CDO assets were valued on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at

$5 million and $291 million,respectively.
There were no other structured CDO assets backed by subprime
mortgages remaining in JPMorgan Chase-administered multi-seller
conduits as of December 31,2008 and 2007.
The Firm does not consider the October 2007 transfer of the structured
CDO assets from the multi-seller conduits to JPMorgan Chase to be an
indicator of JPMorgan Chase™s intent to provide implicit support to the

ELN holders.This transfer was a one-time,isolated event,limited to a

specific type of asset that is not typically funded in the Firm™s adminis-

tered multi-seller conduits.In addition,the Firm has no plans to permit

multi-seller conduits to purchase such assets in the future.
Investor intermediation As a financial intermediary,the Firm creates certain types of VIEs

and also structures transactions,typically derivative structures,with

these VIEs to meet investor needs.The Firm may also provide liquidi-

ty and other support.The risks inherent in the derivative instruments

or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit,mar-

ket or liquidity risks to which the Firm is exposed.The principal

types of VIEs for which the Firm is engaged in these structuring

activities are municipal bond vehicles,credit-linked note vehicles,

asset swap vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles.
Municipal bond vehiclesThe Firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide

short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments,and

that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their invest-
ments at short-term tax-exempt rates.In a typical transaction,the

vehicle purchases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds

and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities:(1) putable

floating-rate certificates and (2) inverse floating-rate residual inter-

ests (ﬁresidual interestsﬂ).The maturity of each of the putable float-

ing-rate certificates and the residual interests is equal to the life of

the vehicle,while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is

longer.Holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may ﬁput,ﬂor

tender,the certificates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully

remarket the floating-rate certificates to another investor.A liquidity

facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the pur-
chase of the tendered floating-rate certificates.Upon termination of

the vehicle,if the proceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal

bonds are not sufficient to repay the liquidity facility,the liquidity

provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle

or the residual interest holders for reimbursement.
The third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could
experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer-

tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi-

nation of the vehicle.Certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest-

ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess
collateralization.For these vehicles there exists a reimbursement obli-

gation which requires the residual interest holders to post,during the

life of the vehicle,additional collateral to the vehicle on a daily basis

as the market value of the municipal bonds declines.
JPMorgan Chase often serves as the sole liquidity provider andremarketing agent of the putable floating-rate certificates.As the liq-

uidity provider,the Firm has an obligation to fund the purchase of

the putable floating-rate certificates;this obligation is triggered by

the failure to remarket the putable floating-rate certificates.The liq-

uidity provider™s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by

certain termination events,which include bankruptcy or failure to pay

by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider,and the

immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment

grade.A downgrade of the JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.™s short-term

rating does not affect the Firm™s obligation under the liquidity facility.

However,in the event of a downgrade in the Firm™s credit ratings,

holders of the putable floating-rate instruments supported by those

liquidity facility commitments might choose to sell their instruments,

which could increase the likelihood that the liquidity commitments

could be drawn.In vehicles in which third-party investors own the

residual interests,in addition to the termination events,the Firm™s

exposure as liquidity provider is further limited by the high credit
quality of the underlying municipal bonds,and the excess collateral-

ization in the vehicle or the reimbursement agreements with the
residual interest holders.In the fourth quarter of 2008,a drawdown

occurred on one liquidity facility as a result of a failure to remarket

putable floating-rate certificates.The Firm was required to purchase

$19 million of putable floating-rate certificates.Subsequently,the

municipal bond vehicle was terminated and the proceeds from the

sales of the municipal bonds,together with the collateral posted by

the residual interest holder,were sufficient to repay the putable

floating-rate certificates.In 2007,the Firm did not experience a

drawdown on the liquidity facilities.
As remarketing agent,the Firm may hold the putable floating-rate
certificates.At December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,the Firm

held $293 million and $617 million of these certificates on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets.The largest amount held by the Firm at

any time during 2008 and 2007 was $2.2 billion and $1.0 billion,

respectively,or 11% and 5%,respectively,of the municipal bond

vehicles™ outstanding putable floating-rate certificates.The Firm did

not have and continues not to have any intent to protect any resid-
ual interest holder from potential losses on any of the municipal
bond holdings.
The long-term credit ratings of the putable floating-rate certificates
are directly related to the credit ratings of the underlying municipal

bonds,and to the credit rating of any insurer of the underlying

municipal bond.A downgrade of a bond insurer would result in a

downgrade of the insured municipal bonds,which would affect the

rating of the putable floating-rate certificates.This could cause

demand for these certificates by investors to decline or disappear,as

putable floating-rate certificate holders typically require an ﬁAA-ﬂ

bond rating.At December 31,2008 and 2007,97% and 99%,

respectively,of the municipal bonds held by vehicles to which the

Firm served as liquidity provider were rated ﬁAA-ﬂor better,based

upon either the rating of the underlying municipal bond itself,or the

rating including any credit enhancement.At December 31,2008 and

2007,$2.6 billion and $12.0 billion,respectively,of the bonds were
Notes to consolidated financial statements194JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
insured by monoline bond insurers.In addition,the municipal bond
vehicles did not experience any bankruptcy or downgrade termina-

tion events during 2008 and 2007.The Firm sometimes invests in the residual interests of municipal
bond vehicles.For VIEs in which the Firm owns the residual interests,

the Firm consolidates the VIEs.
The likelihood that the Firm would have to consolidate VIEs where
the Firm does not own the residual interests and that are currently
off-balance sheet is remote.

(f) The ratings scale is based upon the Firm™s internal risk ratings and presented on an S&P equivalent basis.
Credit-linked note vehiclesThe Firm structures transactions with credit-linked note (ﬁCLNﬂ) vehi-
cles in which the VIE purchases highly rated assets,such as asset-

backed securities,and enters into a credit derivative contract with the

Firm to obtain exposure to a referenced credit which the VIE other-

wise does not hold.The VIE then issues CLNs with maturities predom-

inantly ranging from one to ten years in order to transfer the risk of

the referenced credit to the VIE™s investors.Clients and investors often

prefer using a CLN vehicle since the CLNs issued by the VIE generally

carry a higher credit rating than such notes would if issued directly by

JPMorgan Chase.The Firm™s exposure to the CLN vehicles is generally

limited to its rights and obligations under the credit derivative con-

tract with the VIE,as the Firm does not provide any additional con-

tractual financial support to the VIE.In addition,the Firm has not his-

torically provided any financial support to the CLN vehicles over and
above its contractual obligations.Accordingly,the Firm typically does
not consolidate the CLN vehicles.As a derivative counterparty in a
credit-linked note structure,the Firm has a senior claim on the collat-

eral of the VIE and reports such derivatives on its balance sheet at fair

value.The collateral purchased by such VIEs is largely investment-

grade,with a majority being rated ﬁAAAﬂ.The Firm divides its credit-

linked note structures broadly into two types:static and managed.
In a static credit-linked note structure,the CLNs and associated credit
derivative contract either reference a single credit (e.g.,a multination-

al corporation) or all or part of a fixed portfolio of credits.The Firm

generally buys protection from the VIE under the credit derivative.As

a net buyer of credit protection,the Firm pays a premium to the VIE in

return for the receipt of a payment (up to the notional amount of the
derivative) if one or more of the reference credits defaults,or if the

losses resulting from the default of the reference credits exceed speci-

fied levels.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
195In a managed credit-linked note structure,the CLNs and associated
credit derivative generally reference all or part of an actively managed

portfolio of credits.An agreement exists between a portfolio manager

and the VIE that gives the portfolio manager the ability to substitute

each referenced credit in the portfolio for an alternative credit.By par-

ticipating in a structure where a portfolio manager has the ability to
substitute credits within pre-agreed terms,the investors who own the

CLNs seek to reduce the risk that any single credit in the portfolio willAsset Swap Vehicles
The Firm also structures and executes transactions with asset swap

vehicles on behalf of investors.In such transactions,the VIE purchas-

es a specific asset or assets and then enters into a derivative with

the Firm in order to tailor the interest rate or currency risk,or both,

of the assets according to investors™ requirements.Generally,the

assets are held by the VIE to maturity,and the tenor of the deriva-

tives would match the maturity of the assets.Investors typically

invest in the notes issued by such VIEs in order to obtain exposure to

the credit risk of the specific assets as well as exposure to foreign
exchange and interest rate risk that is tailored to their specific needs;

for example,an interest rate derivative may add additional interest

rate exposure into the VIE in order to increase the return on the

issued notes;or to convert an interest bearing asset into a zero-

coupon bond.The Firm™s exposure to the asset swap vehicles is generally limited
to its rights and obligations under the interest rate and/or foreign

exchange derivative contracts,as the Firm does not provide any con-

tractual financial support to the VIE.In addition,the Firm historically

has not provided any financial support to the asset swap vehicles

over and above its contractual obligations.Accordingly,the Firm 

typically does not consolidate the asset swap vehicles.As a deriva-

tive counterparty,the Firm has a senior claim on the collateral of

the VIE and reports such derivatives on its balance sheet at fair

value.Substantially all of the assets purchased by such VIEs are

investment-grade.
default.The Firm does not act as portfolio manager;its involvement
with the VIE is generally limited to being a derivative counterparty.As

a net buyer of credit protection,the Firm pays a premium to the VIE in

return for the receipt of a payment (up to the notional of the deriva-

tive) if one or more of the credits within the portfolio defaults,or if

the losses resulting from the default of reference credits exceed speci-

fied levels.

hat the par value of the collateral is expected to be suffi-
cient to pay amounts due under the derivative contracts.
Notes to consolidated financial statements196JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Collateralized Debt Obligations vehiclesA CDO typically refers to a security that is collateralized by a pool of
bonds,loans,equity,derivatives or other assets.The Firm™s involve-

ment with a particular CDO vehicle may take one or more of the fol-

lowing forms:arranger,warehouse funding provider,placement

agent or underwriter,secondary market-maker for securities issued,

or derivative counterparty.
Prior to the formal establishment of a CDO vehicle,there is a ware-
housing period where a VIE may be used to accumulate the assets

which will be subsequently securitized and serve as the collateral for

the securities to be issued to investors.During this warehousing

period,the Firm may provide all or a portion of the financing to the

VIE,for which the Firm earns interest on the amounts it finances.

A third-party asset manager that will serve as the manager for the
CDO vehicle uses the warehouse funding provided by the Firm to

purchase the financial assets.The funding commitments generally

are one year in duration.In the event that the securitization of

assets does not occur within the committed financing period,the

warehoused assets are generally liquidated.
Because of the varied levels of support provided by the Firm during
the warehousing period,which typically averages six to nine

months,each CDO warehouse VIE is assessed in accordance with

FIN 46(R) to determine whether the Firm is considered the primarybeneficiary that should consolidate the VIE.In general,the Firm
would consolidate the warehouse VIE unless another third party,

typically the asset manager,provides significant protection for

potential declines in the value of the assets held by the VIE.In those

cases,the third party that provides the protection to the warehouse

VIE would consolidate the VIE.
Once the portfolio of warehoused assets is large enough,the VIE will
issue securities where market conditions permit.The proceeds from

the issuance of securities will be used to repay the warehouse

financing obtained from the Firm and other counterparties.In con-

nection with the establishment of the CDO vehicle,the Firm typically

earns a fee for arranging the CDO vehicle and distributing the securi-

ties (as placement agent and/or underwriter) and does not typically
own any equity tranches issued.Once the CDO vehicle closes and

issues securities,the Firm has no further obligation to provide further

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
197VIEs sponsored by third parties
Investment in a third-party credit card securitization trustThe Firm holds a note in a third-party-sponsored VIE,which is a credit
card securitization trust (the ﬁTrustﬂ),that owns credit card receivables

issued by a national retailer.The note is structured so that the principal

amount can float up to 47% of the principal amount of the receivables

held by the Trust not to exceed $4.2 billion.The Firm is not the primary

beneficiary of the Trust and accounts for its investment as an AFS secu-

rity,which is recorded at fair value.At December 31,2008,the amor-

tized cost of the note was $3.6 billion and the fair value was $2.6 bil-

lion.For more information on accounting for AFS securities,see Note

12 on pages 170Œ174 of this Annual Report.
VIE used in FRBNY transactionIn conjunction with the Bear Stearns merger,in June 2008,the

FRBNY took control,through an LLC formed for this purpose,of a

portfolio of $30.0 billion in assets,based upon the value of the port-

folio as of March 14,2008.The assets of the LLC were funded by a

$28.85 billion term loan from the FRBNY,and a $1.15 billion subor-

dinated loan from JPMorgan Chase.The JPMorgan Chase loan is
subordinated to the FRBNY loan and will bear the first $1.15 billionof any losses of the portfolio.Any remaining assets in the portfolio

after repayment of the FRBNY loan,the JPMorgan Chase loan and

the expense of the LLC,will be for the account of the FRBNY.
Other VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other par-

ties.These transactions include,for example,acting as a derivative

counterparty,liquidity provider,investor,underwriter,placement

agent,trustee or custodian.These transactions are conducted at

arm™s length,and individual credit decisions are based upon the

analysis of the specific VIE,taking into consideration the quality of

the underlying assets.Where these activities do not cause JPMorgan

Chase to absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIEs or to

receive a majority of the residual returns of the VIEs,JPMorgan

Chase records and reports these positions on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets similar to the way it would record and report posi-

tions from any other third-party transaction.These transactions are

not considered significant for disclosure purposes under FIN 46(R).Exposures to CDO warehouse VIEs at December 31,2008 and 2007,were as follows.

Notes to consolidated financial statements198JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Note 18 Œ Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill is not amortized.Instead,it is tested for impairment in
accordance with SFAS 142 at the reporting-unit segment,which is

generally one level below the six major reportable business segments

(as described in Note 37 on pages 226Œ227 of this Annual Report);

plus Private Equity (which is included in Corporate).Goodwill is test-

ed annually (during the fourth quarter) or more often if events or cir-
cumstances,such as adverse changes in the business climate,indi-

cate there may be impairment.Management applies significant judg-

ment when determining the fair value of its reporting units.

Imprecision in estimating the future earnings potential of the Firm™s

reporting units can affect their estimated fair value.In addition,if the

current period of weak economic market conditions persists,then

this could adversely impact the estimates management used to
determine the fair value of its reporting units.Intangible assets deter-
mined to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested forimpairment at least annually,or more frequently if events or changes

in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.The

impairment test compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intan-

gible asset to its carrying amount.Other acquired intangible assets

determined to have finite lives,such as core deposits and credit card

relationships,are amortized over their estimated useful lives in a

manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible
asset;impairment testing is performed periodically on these amortiz-

ing intangible assets.

resulted from the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions

joint venture,the merger with Bear Stearns,the purchase of an addi-

tional equity interest in Highbridge and the tax-related purchase
accounting adjustments associated with the Bank One merger,which

increased goodwill attributed to IB.The decrease in goodwill attrib-

Mortgage servicing rights JPMorgan Chase recognizes as intangible assets mortgage servicing
rights,which represent the right to perform specified mortgage serv-

icing activities (predominantly with respect to residential mortgages)
for others.MSRs are either purchased from third parties or retained

upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans.Servicing activities

include collecting principal,interest,and escrow payments from bor-

rowers;making tax and insurance payments on behalf of borrowers;

monitoring delinquencies and executing foreclosure proceedings;and

accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to the
investors of the mortgage-backed securities.
As permitted by SFAS 156,the Firm elected to fair value MSRs as
one class of servicing assets.The Firm defined MSRs as one class

based on the availability of market inputs to measure MSR fair value

and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk manage-
ment purposes.
The Firm initially capitalizes MSRs based on the estimated fair value
at the time of initial recognition.The Firm estimates the fair value of

MSRs for initial capitalization and ongoing valuation using an

option-adjusted spread model,which projects MSR cash flows over

multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm™s propri-

etary prepayment model and then discounts these cash flows at risk-
adjusted rates.The model considers portfolio characteristics,contrac-

tually specified servicing fees,prepayment assumptions,delinquency

rates,late charges,other ancillary revenue and costs to service,and

other economic factors.The Firm reassesses and periodically adjusts

the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the OAS model to
reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant

would consider in valuing the MSR asset.During 2007 and 2008,the

Firm continued to refine its proprietary payment model based upon a
number of market-related factors,including a downward trend in

home prices,general tightening of credit underwriting standards and

the associated impact on refinancing activity.The Firm compares fair

value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where

available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experi-

ence.
The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates,
including their effect on prepayment speeds.JPMorgan Chase uses

or has used combinations of derivatives and trading instruments to

manage changes in the fair value of MSRs.The intent is to offset any

changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of

the related risk management instruments.MSRs decrease in value

when interest rates decline.Conversely,securities (such as mortgage-

backed securities),principal-only certificates and certain derivatives

(when the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in

value when interest rates decline.
Notes to consolidated financial statements200JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to
determine the fair value of the Firm™s MSRs at December 31,2008

and 2007,respectively;and it outlines the sensitivities of those fair

values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those

assumptions.

The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and
should be used with caution.Changes in fair value based upon a

10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily

extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assump-

tions to the change in fair value may not be linear.Also,in this table,

the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the
fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption.In

reality,changes in one factor may result in changes in another,which

might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Purchased credit card relationships and all other 
intangible assets  
During 2008,purchased credit card relationships,other credit card-

related intangibles and core deposit intangibles decreased $727 mil-
lion,primarily as a result of amortization expense,partially offset by

an increase in intangibles recognized related to the dissolution of the
Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture.Other intangibles (net of

amortization) increased $209 million primarily as a result of the pur-
chase of an additional equity interest in Highbridge as well as the
acquisition of an institutional global custody portfolio.
Except for $517 million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to assetmanagement advisory contracts,which are not amortized but are

tested for impairment at least annually,the remainder of the Firm™s

other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended

201Note 19 Œ Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment,including leasehold improvements,are 
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line

method over the estimated useful life of an asset.For leasehold

improvements,the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over

the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimat-

ed useful life of the leased asset.JPMorgan Chase has recorded
immaterial asset retirement obligations related to asbestos remedia-
tion under SFAS 143 and FIN 47 in those cases where it has suffi-

cient information to estimate the obligations™ fair value.
JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisi-tion or development of internal-use software under SOP 98-1.Once

the software is ready for its intended use,these costs are amortized

on a straight-line basis over the software™s expected useful life and

reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

September 19,2008,the Federal Reserve Board established a temporary lending
facility,the AML Facility,to provide liquidity to eligible U.S.money market mutual funds

(ﬁMMMFsﬂ).Under the AML Facility,banking organizations must use the loan pro-

ceeds to finance their purchases of eligible high-quality ABCP investments from

MMMFs,which are pledged to secure nonrecourse advances from the FRBB.

Participating banking organizations do not bear any credit or market risk related to the

ABCP investments they hold under this facility;therefore,the ABCP investments held

are not assessed any regulatory capital.The AML Facility will be in effect until October

30,2009.The nonrecourse advances from the FRBB were elected under the fair value

option and recorded in other borrowed funds;the corresponding ABCP investments

were also elected under the fair value option and recorded in other assets.

for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate set by an auc-

tion.All advances are required to be fully collateralized.The TAF is designed to

improve liquidity by making it easier for sound institutions to borrow when the mar-

(a)Included are various equity-linked or other indexed instruments.Embedded derivatives,separated from hybrid securities in acc
ordance with SFAS 133,are reported at fair value and
shown net with the host contract on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Changes in fair value of separated derivatives are recorded
 in principal transactions revenue.Hybrid securities
which the Firm has elected to measure at fair value are classified in the line item of the host contract on the Consolidated Ba
lance Sheets;changes in fair value are recorded in princi-
pal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(b)The interest rates shown are the range of contractual rates in effect at year-end,including non U.S.dollar fixed- and variab
le-rate issuances,which excludes the effects of the associated
derivative instruments used in SFAS 133 hedge accounting relationships,if applicable.The use of these derivative instruments mo
difies the Firm™s exposure to the contractual interest
rates disclosed in the table above.Including the effects of the SFAS 133 hedge accounting derivatives,the range of modified rat
es in effect at December 31,2008,for total long-term
debt was 0.18% to 14.21%,versus the contractual range of 0.03% to 14.21% presented in the table above.The interest rate ranges 
shown exclude structured notes accounted for atfair value under SFAS 155 or SFAS 159.
(c) Included $7.8 billion principal amount of U.S.dollar-denominated floating-rate mortgage bonds issued to an unaffiliated sta
tutory trust,which in turn issued C
=6.0 billion in coveredbonds secured by mortgage loans at December 31,2008.
(d) Included $58.2 billion and $70.5 billion of outstanding structured notes accounted for at fair value at December 31,2008 an
d 2007,respectively.
(e)Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs.Also included $1.7 billion a
nd $3.0 billion of outstanding structured notes accountedfor at fair value at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.
(f)Included $14.1 billion as of December 31,2008,guaranteed under the TLG Program whereby newly issued senior,unsecured debt is
 guaranteed by the FDIC,which is discussed below.
(g)Included $6.9 billion as of December 31,2008,guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG Program,which is discussed below.

(h)At December 31,2008,long-term debt aggregating $7.4 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase,in whole or in pa
rt,prior to maturity,based upon the terms speci-
fied in the respective notes.
(i)The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2008 is $36.0 billion in 2009,$3
8.5 billion in 2010,$39.7 billion in 2011,$32.7 billion
in 2012 and $18.6 billion in 2013.(j) Included $3.4 billion and $4.6 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.The aggre
gate principal amount of these notes at their respec-tive maturities was $7.1 billion and $7.7 billion,respectively.
JPMorgan Chase has elected to continue to participate in the TLG
Program,which is available to,among others,all U.S.depository insti-

tutions insured by the FDIC and all U.S.bank holding companies,

unless they have opted out of the TLG Program or the FDIC has termi-

nated their participation.Under the TLG Program,the FDIC guarantees

certain senior unsecured debt of JPMorgan Chase through the earlier
of maturity and June 30,2012,and in return for the guarantees,the

FDIC is paid a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt.The weighted-average contractual interest rate for total long-term debt
was 4.06% and 5.20% as of December 31,2008 and 2007,respec-

tively.In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency

exchange rate movements,JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instru-

ments,primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps,in

conjunction with some of its debt issues.The use of these instruments

modifies the Firm™s interest expense on the associated debt.The modi-

fied weighted-average interest rate for total long-term debt,including

the effects of related derivative instruments,was 3.53% and 5.13% as

of December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.
Notes to consolidated financial statements204JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Under the TLG Program,the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and
interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured

failure of the participating entity to make a timely payment of princi-

pal or interest in accordance with the terms of the instrument.The

guarantee of new obligations under the TLG Program is scheduled to

expire in October 2009.JPMorgan Chase & Co.(Parent Company) has guaranteed certain debt
of its subsidiaries,including both long-term debt and structured notes

sold as part of the Firm™s market-making activities.These guarantees

rank on a parity with all of the Firm™s other unsecured and unsubordi-

nated indebtedness.Guaranteed liabilities totaled $4.8 billion and $4.7

billion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.For additional

information,see Note 2 on pages 135Œ140 of this Annual Report.
Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by
trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities 

At December 31,2008,the Firm had established 24 wholly-owned

Delaware statutory business trusts (ﬁissuer trustsﬂ) that had issued

guaranteed capital debt securities.
The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the
Firm to the issuer trusts,totaling $18.6 billion and $15.1 billion at

December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,were reflected in the

Firm™s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the liabilities section under the

caption ﬁJunior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by

trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securitiesﬂ(i.e.,trust pre-

ferred capital debt securities).The Firm also records the common

capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in other assets in its
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,2008 and 2007.
The debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm,less the com-
mon capital securities of the issuer trusts,qualify as Tier 1 capital.
The following is a summary of the outstanding trust preferred capital debt securities,including unamortized original issue disc
ount,issued by each

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
205Note 24 Œ Preferred stock
JPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 200 million shares of pre-ferred stock,in one or more series,with a par value of $1 per share.
On April 23,2008,the Firm issued 600,000 shares of Fixed to
Floating Rate Noncumulative Perpetual 
Preferred Stock,Series I
(ﬁSeries Iﬂ).On July 15,2008,each series of Bear Stearns preferred stock then
issued and outstanding was exchanged into a series of JPMorgan

Chase preferred stock (Cumulative Preferred Stock,Series E,Series F

and Series G) having substantially identical terms.As a result of the

exchange,these preferred shares rank equally with the other series

of the Firm™s preferred stock.
On August 21,2008,the Firm issued 180,000 shares of 8.625%
Noncumulative Perpetual 
Preferred Stock,Series J (ﬁSeries Jﬂ).
On October 28,2008,pursuant to the U.S.Department of the
Treasury™s (the ﬁU.S.Treasuryﬂ) Capital Purchase Program (the

ﬁCapital Purchase Programﬂ),the Firm issued to the U.S.Treasury,in

exchange for total proceeds of $25.0 billion,(i) 2.5 million shares of

the Firm™s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,Series K,

par value $1 per share and liquidation preference $10,000 per share

(the ﬁSeries K Preferred Stockﬂ),and (ii) a warrant to purchase

88,401,697 shares of the Firm™s common stock at an exercise price
of $42.42 per share (the ﬁWarrantﬂ).The $25.0 billion proceeds
were allocated to the Series K Preferred Stock and the Warrant based

on the relative fair value of the instruments.The difference between

the initial carrying value of $23.7 billion that was allocated to the

Series K Preferred Stock and its redemption value of $25.0 billion

will be charged to retained earnings (with a corresponding increase
in the carrying value of the Series K Preferred Stock) over the first

five years of the contract as an adjustment to the dividend yield

using the effective yield method.The Series K Preferred Stock is non-

voting,qualifies as Tier 1 capital and ranks equally with the Firm™s

other series of preferred stock.
In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm,JPMorgan
Chase™s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the

Firm™s common stock for the payment of dividends and the distribu-

tion of assets.
Generally,dividends on shares of outstanding series of preferred
stock are payable quarterly.Dividends on the shares of Series I pre-

ferred stock are payable semiannually at a fixed annual dividend rate

of 7.90% through April 2018,and then become payable quarterly at

an annual dividend rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.47%.

Dividends are payable quarterly on the Series K Preferred Stock at a

fixed annual dividend rate of 5% for the first five years,and a fixed

annual dividend rate of 9% thereafter.The effective dividend yield of

Series K Preferred stock is 6.16%.The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock outstanding as of December 31,2008.There was no preferred stock ou
tstandingat December 31,2007.

Series K Preferred Stock 
Dividend restrictionsFor as long as any shares of Series K Preferred Stock are outstand-
ing,no dividends may be declared or paid on stock ranking junior or

equally with the Series K Preferred Stock,unless all accrued and

unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the Series K
Preferred Stock are fully paid.Pursuant to the Capital Purchase

Program,until October 28,2011,the U.S.Treasury™s consent is

required for any increase in dividends on the Firm™s common stock

from the amount of the last quarterly stock dividend declared by the
Firm prior to October 14,2008,unless the Series K Preferred Stock is

redeemed in whole before then,or the U.S.Treasury has transferred

all of the Series K Preferred Stock it owns to third parties.
Stock repurchase restrictionsThe Firm may not repurchase or redeem any common stock or other

equity securities of the Firm,or any trust preferred capital debt secu-

rities issued by the Firm or any of its affiliates,without the prior con-

sent of the U.S.Treasury (other than (i) repurchases of the Series K

Preferred Stock and (ii) repurchases of junior preferred shares or

common stock in connection with any employee benefit plan in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) until

October 28,2011,unless the Series K Preferred Stock is redeemed in

whole before then,or the U.S.Treasury has transferred all of the

Series K Preferred Stock it owns to third parties.
Note 25 Œ Common stockAt December 31,2008,JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0

billion shares of common stock with a $1 par value per share.
On September 30,2008,the Firm issued $11.5 billion of new shares
of common stock at $40.50 per share,representing 284 million shares.
On April 8,2008,pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement dated
March 24,2008,between JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns,20.7

million newly issued shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock were
issued to Bear Stearns in a transaction that was exempt from registra-

tion under the Securities Act of 1933,pursuant to Section 4(2) there-

of,in exchange for 95.0 million newly issued shares of Bear Stearns

common stock (or 39.5% of Bear Stearns common stock after giving
effect to the issuance).Upon the consummation of the Bear Stearns

merger,on May 30,2008,the 20.7 million shares of JPMorgan Chase

common stock and 95.0 million shares of Bear Stearns common stock
were cancelled.For a further discussion of this transaction,see Note 2

Pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program,the Firm issued to the
U.S.Treasury a Warrant to purchase up to 88,401,697 shares of the

Firm™s common stock at an exercise price of $42.42 per share.Based

upon its fair value relative to the Series K Preferred Stock as dis-

cussed in Note 24 on pages 205Œ206 of this Annual Report,the

Warrant was recorded in capital surplus at a value of $1.3 billion

and is accounted for as equity.The Warrant is exercisable,in whole

or in part,at any time and from time to time until the tenth anniver-

sary of the issue date.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
207During the year ended December 31,2008,the Firm did not repur-
chase any shares of common stock.During 2007 and 2006,the Firm

repurchased 168 million shares and 91 million shares,respectively,of

common stock under stock repurchase programs approved by the

Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors approved in April 2007,a stock repurchase
program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the

Firm™s common shares,which superseded an $8.0 billion stock repur-

chase program approved in 2006.The $10.0 billion authorization

includes shares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the
Firm™s employee stock-based plans.The actual number of shares that

may be repurchased is subject to various factors,including market

conditions;legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of

repurchase activity;the Firm™s capital position (taking into account

goodwill and intangibles);internal capital generation;and alternative

potential investment opportunities.The repurchase program does not

include specific price targets or timetables;may be executed through

open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,or utiliz-

ing Rule 10b5-1 programs;and may be suspended at any time.A

Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase shares
during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing com-
mon stock Œ for example,during internal trading ﬁblack-out peri-

ods.ﬂAll purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made accord-

ing to a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not
aware of material nonpublic information.
For a discussion of restrictions on the Firm™s ability to repurchase the
Firm™s common stock,see Note 24 above.
As of December 31,2008,approximately 524 million unissued
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various

employee incentive,compensation,option and stock purchase plans,

director compensation plans and the Warrant issued to the U.S.

Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program as discussed above.
Note 26 Œ Earnings per share
SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per

share (ﬁEPSﬂ) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Basic EPS is

computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the

period.Diluted EPS is computed using the same method for the

numerator as basic EPS but,in the denominator,the number of com-

mon shares reflect,in addition to outstanding shares,the potential
dilution that could occur if convertible securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were converted or exercised into common stock.
Net income available for common stock is the same for basic EPS

and diluted EPS,as JPMorgan Chase had no convertible securities,

and therefore,no adjustments to net income applicable to common

stock were necessary.The following table presents the calculation of

basic and diluted EPS for 2008,2007 and 2006.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
209Note 28 Œ Income taxes  JPMorgan Chase and eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S.fed-
eral income tax return.JPMorgan Chase uses the asset-and-liability

method required by SFAS 109 as amended by FIN 48 to provide

income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated finan-

cial statements.This method requires that income taxes reflect the

expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between

the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purpos-
es.Accordingly,a deferred tax liability or asset for each temporary

difference is determined based upon the tax rates that the Firm

expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and
expense are realized.JPMorgan Chase™s expense for income taxes

includes the current and deferred portions of that expense.A valua-

tion allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the

amount the Firm expects to realize.
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm™s
businesses,and from conducting business and being taxed in a sub-

stantial number of jurisdictions,significant judgments and estimates

are required to be made.Agreement of tax liabilities between

JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm
files tax returns may not be finalized for several years.Thus,the

Firm™s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be differ-

ent than those currently reported.The components of income tax expense (benefit) included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income were as follows.

Total income tax expense includes $55 million,$74 million,and
$367 million of tax benefits recorded in 2008,2007 and 2006,

respectively,as a result of tax audit resolutions.
The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items
that are recorded each period directly in stockholders™ equity and cer-
tain tax benefits associated with the Firm™s employee stock-based

compensation plans.The table does not reflect the cumulative tax

effects of initially implementing new accounting pronouncements in

2007 and 2006.The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stock-

holders™ equity was an increase in stockholders™ equity of $3.0 billion,

$159 million and $885 million in 2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.
U.S.federal income taxes have not been provided on the undistrib-
uted earnings of certain non-U.S.subsidiaries,to the extent that such

earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of
time.During 2008,as part of JPMorgan Chase™s periodic review of

the business requirements and capital needs of its non-U.S.sub-

sidiaries,combined with the formation of specific strategies and

steps taken to fulfill these requirements and needs,the Firm deter-

mined that the undistributed earnings of certain of its subsidiaries,

for which U.S.federal income taxes had been provided,will remain

indefinitely reinvested to fund the current and future growth of the
related businesses.As management does not intend to use the earn-

ings of these subsidiaries as a source of funding for its U.S.opera-

tions,such earnings will not be distributed to the U.S.in the foresee-

able future.This determination resulted in the release of deferred tax

liabilities and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $1.1 billion
associated with these undistributed earnings.For 2008,pretax earn-

ings of approximately $2.5 billion were generated that will remain

indefinitely invested in these subsidiaries.At December 31,2008,the

cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these sub-
sidiaries approximated $12.9 billion.If the Firm were to record a

deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings,

the amount would be $2.9 billion at December 31,2008.
The tax expense (benefit) applicable to securities gains and losses for
the years 2008,2007 and 2006 was $608 million,$60 million and

$(219) million,respectively.

JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion inconnection with net operating loss and business tax credit carry for-

wards.The U.S.federal net operating loss carryforward of approxi-

mately $1.3 billion,the state and local net operating loss carryfor-

wards of approximately $7.2 billion,and the business tax credit car-

ryforward of approximately $300 million are subject to annual limita-

tions on utilization.If not utilized,the net operating losses would

expire in 2026,2027 and 2028,and the business tax credits would

expire in 2028.In addition,an alternative minimum tax credit carry-

forward has been recorded for approximately $200 million and has

an indefinite carryforward period.
A valuation allowance has been recorded relating to state and local
net operating losses,losses associated with non-U.S.subsidiaries and

losses associated with certain portfolio investments.The increase in

the valuation allowance from the prior year to 2008 is largely related

to Bear Stearns.
The Firm adopted and applied FIN 48,which addresses the recogni-
tion and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be

taken,and also provides guidance on derecognition,classification,

interest and penalties,accounting in interim periods and disclosure,

to all of its income tax positions at the required effective date of
January 1,2007,resulting in a $436 million cumulative effect

increase to retained earnings,a reduction in goodwill of $113 million

and a $549 million decrease in the liability for income taxes.
At December 31,2008 and 2007,JPMorgan Chase™s unrecognized
tax benefits,excluding related interest expense and penalties,were

$5.9 billion and $4.8 billion,respectively,of which $2.9 billion and

$1.3 billion,if recognized,would reduce the annual effective tax

rate.As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of

tax authorities,it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax bene-

fits could significantly change over the next 12 months,which could

also significantly impact JPMorgan Chase™s quarterly and annual

effective tax rates.

2008 and 2007,in addition to the Firm™s liability for unrecognized

tax benefits,was $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion,respectively,for

income tax-related interest and penalties,of which the penalty com-

ponent was insignificant.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
211JPMorgan Chase is subject to ongoing tax examinations by the taxauthorities of the various jurisdictions in which it operates,including

U.S.federal and state and non-U.S.jurisdictions.The Firm™s consoli-

dated federal income tax returns are presently under examination by

the Internal Revenue Service (ﬁIRSﬂ) for the years 2003,2004 and

2005.The consolidated federal income tax returns of Bank One

Corporation,which merged with and into JPMorgan Chase on July 1,

2004,are under examination for the years 2000 through 2003,and

for the period January 1,2004,through July 1,2004.The consolidat-

ed federal income tax returns of Bear Stearns for the years ended

November 30,2003,2004 and 2005,are also under examination.All

three examinations are expected to conclude in 2009.The IRS audits

of the consolidated federal income tax returns of JPMorgan Chase

for the years 2006 and 2007,and for Bear Stearns for the years

ended November 30,2006 and 2007,are expected to commence in

2009.Administrative appeals are pending with the IRS relating to

prior examination periods.For 2002 and prior years,refund claims

relating to income and credit adjustments,and to tax attribute carry-

backs,for JPMorgan Chase and its predecessor entities,including

Bank One,have been filed.Amended returns to reflect refund claims

primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carry-

backs will be filed for the final Bear Stearns federal consolidated tax

return for the period December 1,2007,through May 30,2008,and

for prior years.

Note 29 Œ Restrictions on cash and intercom-
pany funds transfers
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank,National Association
(ﬁJPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.ﬂ) is subject to examination and regula-

tion by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (ﬁOCCﬂ).The

Bank is a member of the U.S.Federal Reserve System,and its deposits

are insured by the FDIC as discussed in Note 20 on page 202 of this
Annual Report.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ﬁFederal
Reserveﬂ) requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves

with a Federal Reserve Bank.The average amount of reserve bal-

ances deposited by the Firm™s bank subsidiaries with various Federal

Reserve Banks was approximately $1.6 billion in 2008 and 2007.
Restrictions imposed by U.S.federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase
and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries

unless the loans are secured in specified amounts.Such secured

loans to the Firm or to other affiliates are generally limited to 10%

of the banking subsidiary™s total capital,as determined by the risk-

based capital guidelines;the aggregate amount of all such loans is

limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary™s total capital.
The principal sources of JPMorgan Chase™s income (on a parent com-
panyŒonly basis) are dividends and interest from JPMorgan Chase
Bank,N.A.,and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of

JPMorgan Chase.In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in

statutes and regulations,the Federal Reserve,the OCC and the FDIC

have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to pro-

hibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations
they supervise,including JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries that are

banks or bank holding companies,if,in the banking regulator™s opin-

ion,payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound

practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.
At January 1,2009 and 2008,JPMorgan Chase™s banking sub-
sidiaries could pay,in the aggregate,$17.0 billion and $16.2 billion,

respectively,in dividends to their respective bank holding companies

without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.The

capacity to pay dividends in 2009 will be supplemented by the bank-
ing subsidiaries™ earnings during the year.
In compliance with rules and regulations established by U.S.and
non-U.S.regulators,as of December 31,2008 and 2007,cash in the

amount of $20.8 billion and $16.0 billion,respectively,and securities

with a fair value of $12.1 billion and $3.4 billion,respectively,were

segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and
futures brokerage customers.
Notes to consolidated financial statements212JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Note 30 Œ CapitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,including well-
capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company.

The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for

the Firm™s national banks,including JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,and

Chase Bank USA,N.A.
There are two categories of risk-based capital:Tier 1 capital and Tier
2 capital.Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders™ equity,quali-

fying preferred stock and minority interest less goodwill and other
adjustments.Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying

as Tier 1,subordinated long-term debt and other instruments quali-

fying as Tier 2,and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to

a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets.Total regulatory capital

is subject to deductions for investments in certain subsidiaries.

Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve,

JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1

and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets,as well
as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital to
average adjusted on-balance sheet assets).Failure to meet these

minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take

action.Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital

requirements by their respective primary regulators.As of December

31,2008 and 2007,JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking sub-

sidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to
which each was subject.
The Federal Reserve granted the Firm,for a period of 18 months fol-
lowing the Bear Stearns merger,relief up to a certain specified

amount and subject to certain conditions from the Federal Reserve™s

risk-based capital and leverage requirements with respect to Bear

Stearns™ risk-weighted assets and other exposures acquired.The

amount of such relief is subject to reduction by one-sixth each quar-
ter subsequent to the merger and expires on October 1,2009.The

OCC granted JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.similar relief from its risk-

based capital and leverage requirements.

Note:Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities which have resulted from both
 nontaxable business combinations and from tax-
deductible goodwill.The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from nontaxable business combinations totaling $1.1 billion
 at December 31,2008,and $2.0 billion at December
31,2007.Additionally,the Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $1.6 billion at December 3

from its reference to an underlying variable or combination of variables

such as equity,foreign exchange,credit,commodity or interest rate

prices or indices.JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for

customers and also is an end-user of derivatives in order to hedge or

manage risks of market exposures,modify the interest rate character-

istics of related balance sheet instruments or meet longer-term

investment objectives.The majority of the Firm™s derivatives are

entered into for market-making purposes.SFAS 133,as amended by

SFAS 138,SFAS 149,SFAS 155 and FSP FAS 133-1,establishes

accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,

including those used for trading and hedging activities and derivative

instruments embedded in other contracts.All free-standing deriva-

tives are required to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at fair value.The accounting for changes in value of a derivative

depends on whether or not the contract has been designated and

qualifies for hedge accounting.Derivative receivables and payables,

whether designated for hedging relationships or not,are recorded in

trading assets and trading liabilities as set forth in Note 6 on page

159 of this Annual Report.
Derivatives used for trading purposesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives for customers seeking to mod-

ify,or reduce interest rate,credit,foreign exchange,equity and com-

modity and other market risks or for risk-taking purposes.The Firm

typically manages its exposure from such derivatives by entering into

derivatives or other financial instruments that partially or fully offset

the exposure from the client transaction.The Firm actively manages

any residual exposure and seeks to earn a spread between the client
derivatives and offsetting positions.For the Firm™s own account,the

Firm uses derivatives to take risk positions or to benefit from differ-

ences in prices between derivative markets and markets for other

financial instruments.
Derivatives used for risk management purposes
Interest rate contracts,which are generally interest rate swaps,for-

wards and futures are utilized in the Firm™s risk management activi-

ties to minimize fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate

volatility.As a result of interest rate fluctuations,fixed-rate assets

and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value.Gains or loss-

es on the derivative instruments that are linked to fixed-rate assets

and liabilities and forecasted transactions are expected to offset sub-

stantially this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.Interest

income and interest expense on variable-rate assets and liabilities

and on forecasted transactions increase or decrease as a result of

interest rate fluctuations.Gains and losses on the derivative instru-

ments that are linked to assets and liabilities and forecasted transac-

tions are expected to offset substantially this variability in earnings.

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-

rate interest payments based on the contracted notional amount.

Forward contracts used for the Firm™s interest rate risk management

activities are primarily arrangements to exchange cash in the future
based on price movements of specified financial instruments.Futures
contracts used are primarily index futures which provide for cash

payments based upon the movements of an underlying rate index.
The Firm uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign
exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated
(i.e.,non-U.S.) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions

denominated in a foreign currency,as well as the Firm™s equity

investments in foreign subsidiaries.As a result of foreign currency

fluctuations,the U.S.dollar equivalent values of the foreign currency-

denominated assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions change.

Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the

foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities or forecasted trans-

actions are expected to offset substantially this variability.Foreign

exchange forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the

currency of one country for the currency of another country at an
agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date.
The Firm uses forward contracts to manage the overall price risk
associated with the gold inventory in its commodities portfolio.As a

result of gold price fluctuations,the fair value of the gold inventory

changes.Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked

to gold inventory are expected to substantially offset this unrealized
appreciation or depreciation.Forward contracts used for the Firm™s

gold inventory risk management activities are arrangements to deliv-

er gold in the future.
The Firm uses credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated
with loans,lending-related commitments and derivative receivables,

as well as exposure to residential and commercial mortgages.Credit

derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in

the contract experiences a credit event such as bankruptcy or a fail-

ure to pay an obligation when due.For a further discussion of credit

derivatives,see the discussion below.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting,a derivative must be consid-
ered highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the expo-
sure being hedged.In order for a derivative to be designated as a

hedge,there must be documentation of the risk management objec-

tive and strategy,including identification of the hedging instrument,

the hedged item and the risk exposure,and how effectiveness is to

be assessed prospectively and retrospectively.To assess effectiveness,

the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis,as well

as nonstatistical methods including dollar value comparisons of the

change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair

value or cash flows of the hedged item.The extent to which a hedg-

ing instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective
at achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows must be

assessed and documented at least quarterly.Any ineffectiveness must

be reported in current-period earnings.If it is determined that a

derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure,

hedge accounting is discontinued.For qualifying fair value hedges,all changes in the fair value of the
derivative and in the fair value of the hedged item for the risk being

hedged are recognized in earnings.If the hedge relationship is termi-

nated,then the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
215to be reported as part of the basis of the item and continues to beamortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.For qualifying cash flow

hedges,the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the

derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and rec-

ognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the hedged
cash flows affect earnings.The ineffective portions of cash flow

hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.If the hedge relation-

ship is terminated,then the change in fair value of the derivative

recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recog-
nized when the cash flows that were hedged occur,consistent with

the original hedge strategy.For hedge relationships that are discon-

tinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur

according to the original strategy,any related derivative amounts

recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are
immediately recognized in earnings.For qualifying net investment

hedges,changes in the fair value of the derivative or the revaluation

of the foreign currencyŒdenominated debt instrument are recorded
in the translation adjustments account within accumulated other

comprehensive income (loss).JPMorgan Chase™s fair value hedges primarily include hedges of the
interest rate risk inherent in fixed-rate long-term debt,warehouse

loans,AFS securities,and the overall price of gold inventory.All

changes in the hedging derivative™s fair value are included in earn-

ings consistent with the classification of the hedged item,primarily

net interest income for long-term debt and AFS securities;other

income for warehouse loans;and principal transactions revenue for

gold inventory.The Firm did not recognize any gains or losses during

2008,2007 or 2006 on firm commitments that no longer qualified

as fair value hedges.
JPMorgan Chase also enters into derivative contracts to hedge expo-
sure to variability in cash flows from floating-rate financial instru-

ments and forecasted transactions,primarily the rollover of short-

term assets and liabilities,and foreign currencyŒdenominated rev-

enue and expense.All hedging derivative amounts affecting earnings

are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item,
primarily net interest income.
The Firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign cur-
rencyŒdenominated debt instruments to protect the value of net

investments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S.

dollar.The portion of the hedging derivative excluded from the

assessment of hedge effectiveness (i.e.,forward points) is recorded in

net interest income.
JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all ofthe Firm™s economic hedges.For example,the Firm does not apply

hedge accounting to purchased credit default swaps used to manage

the credit risk of loans and commitments because of the difficulties
in qualifying such contracts as hedges under SFAS 133.Similarly,the

Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate deriva-

tives used as economic hedges.

(b)During the second half of 2007,the Firm did not issue short-term fixed rate
Canadian dollar denominated notes due to the weak credit market for Canadian

short-term debt.Over the next 12 months,it is expected that $348 million (after-tax)
of net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) at December 31,2008,will be recognized in earnings.The

maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are

hedged is ten years,and such transactions primarily relate to core

lending and borrowing activities.
Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from

the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the ref-
erence entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to
transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller).Credit deriva-

tives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the
protection seller,as the protection seller is required to make payments

under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit

event,such as a bankruptcy,failure to pay its obligation,or a restruc-

turing.The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing

protection,but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced

in the contract will be subjected to a credit event.
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the
credit derivatives market and uses credit derivatives for two primary

purposes.First,in its capacity as a market-maker in the

dealer/client business,the Firm actively risk manages a portfolio of

credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection,pre-

dominantly on corporate debt obligations,to meet the needs of

customers.As a seller of protection,the Firm™s exposure to a given

reference entity  may be offset partially,or entirely,with a contract

to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or

similar reference entity.Second,the Firm uses credit derivatives in

order to mitigate the Firm™s credit risk associated with the overall

derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending

exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) as well as to man-

age its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages.See

Note 4 on pages 141Œ155 of this Annual Report for further infor-

mation on the Firm™s mortgage-related exposures.In accomplishing

the above,the Firm uses different types of credit derivatives.

Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.
Notes to consolidated financial statements216JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Credit default swapsCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer-
ence entity (ﬁsingle-nameﬂ) or a broad-based index,as described

further below.The Firm purchases and sells protection on both sin-

gle-name and index-reference obligations.Single-name credit

default swaps (ﬁCDSﬂ) and index CDS contracts are both OTC

derivative contracts.Single-name CDS are used to manage the

default risk of a single reference entity,while CDS index are used

to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or

credit market segments.Like the S&P 500 and other market indices,

a CDS index is comprised of a portfolio of CDS across many refer-

ence entities.New series of CDS indices are established approxi-

mately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of refer-

ence entities to reflect changes in the credit markets.If one of the

reference entities in the index experiences a credit event,then the

reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index and is

replaced with another reference entity.CDS can also be referenced

against specific portfolios of reference names or against cus-

tomized exposure levels based on specific client demands:for

example,to provide protection against the first $1 million of real-

ized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure.Such

structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS,upon the
occurrence of a credit event,under the terms of a CDS contract

neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference

entity.The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection sell-

er for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract

and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling

the credit derivative contract,also known as the recovery value.The

protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of
the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due

under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.
Credit-linked notesA credit linked note (ﬁCLNﬂ) is a funded credit derivative where the

issuer of the CLN purchases credit protection on a referenced entity

from the note investor.Under the contract,the investor pays the

issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction,and

in return,the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor,based

on the credit risk of the referenced entity.The issuer also repays

the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the refer-

ence entity experiences a specified credit event.In that event,the

issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note,but

rather,the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par

value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obli-

gation at the time of settlement.Neither party to the CLN has

recourse to the defaulting reference entity.For a further discussion

of CLNs,see Note 17 on pages 194Œ195 of this Annual Report.
The following table presents a summary of the notional amounts of
credit derivatives and credit-linked notes the Firm sold and pur-

chased,and the net position as of December 31,2008.Upon a

credit event,the Firm as seller of protection would typically pay out

only a percentage of the full notional of net protection sold;as the

amount that is actually required to be paid on the contracts take

into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the

time of settlement.The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to

sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar
underlying reference entities;as such other protection purchased

referenced in the following table includes credit derivatives bought

on related,but not identical reference positions,including indices,

portfolio coverage and other reference points,which further miti-

gates the risk associated with the net protection sold.

Note 33 Œ Off-balance sheet lending-related
financial instruments and guarantees
JPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments (e.g.,
commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its

customers.The contractual amount of these financial instruments

represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterpar-

ties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obliga-

tion under these guarantees,and the counterparties subsequently fail

to perform according to the terms of these contracts.Most of these

commitments and guarantees expire without a default occurring or
without being drawn.As a result,the total contractual amount of
these instruments is not,in the Firm™s view,representative of its

actual future credit exposure or funding requirements.Further,cer-

tain commitments,predominantly related to consumer financings,are

cancelable,upon notice,at the option of the Firm.
To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale related contracts,
an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is

maintained.See Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this Annual Report

for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses on lending-

related commitments.
The following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantee
s and the relat-
ed allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at December 31,2008 and 2007.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
219Other unfunded commitments to extend credit
Unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend or
to purchase securities only when a customer has complied with pre-
determined conditions,and they generally expire on fixed dates.
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit include commitmentsto U.S.domestic states and municipalities,hospitals and other not-for-

profit entities to provide funding for periodic tenders of their variable-

rate demand bond obligations or commercial paper.Performance by

the Firm is required in the event that the variable-rate demand bonds

or commercial paper cannot be remarketed to new investors.The per-

formance required of the Firm under these agreements is conditional

and limited by certain termination events,which include bankruptcy

and the credit rating downgrade of the issuer of the variable-rate

demand bonds or commercial paper to below certain predetermined
thresholds.The commitment period is generally one to three years.The

amount of commitments related to variable-rate demand bonds and

commercial paper of U.S.domestic states and municipalities,hospitals

and not-for-profit entities at December 31,2008 and 2007,was

$23.5 billion and $24.1 billion,respectively.
Included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are com-mitments to investment and noninvestment grade counterparties in

connection with leveraged acquisitions.These commitments are

dependent on whether the acquisition by the borrower is successful,
tend to be short-term in nature and,in most cases,are subject to

certain conditions based on the borrower™s financial condition or

other factors.Additionally,the Firm often syndicates portions of the

commitment to other investors,depending on market conditions.

These commitments often contain flexible pricing features to adjust

for changing market conditions prior to closing.Alternatively,the

borrower may turn to the capital markets for required funding

instead of drawing on the commitment provided by the Firm,and the

commitment may expire unused.As such,these commitments may

not necessarily be indicative of the Firm™s actual risk,and the total

commitment amount may not reflect actual future cash flow require-
ments.The amount of commitments related to leveraged acquisitions

at December 31,2008 and 2007,was $3.6 billion and $8.2 billion,

respectively.For further information,see Note 4 and Note 5 on pages

141Œ155 and 156Œ158,respectively,of this Annual Report.
FIN 45 guaranteesFIN 45 establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for guar-
antees,requiring that a guarantor recognize,at the inception of a

guarantee,a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obli-

gation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.FIN 45 defines a guaran-

tee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a

guaranteed party,based upon:(a) changes in an underlying asset,

liability or equity security of the guaranteed party;or (b) a third

party™s failure to perform under a specified agreement.The Firm con-

siders the following off-balance sheet lending-related arrangements

to be guarantees under FIN 45:certain asset purchase agreements,

standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,securities lending

indemnifications,certain indemnification agreements included within

third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts.

These guarantees are described in further detail below.
The fair value at inception of the obligation undertaken when issuing
the guarantees and commitments that qualify under FIN 45 is typi-

cally equal to the net present value of the future amount of premium

receivable under the contract.The Firm has recorded this amount in

other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in other assets.As

cash is received under the contract,it is applied to the premium

receivable recorded in other assets,and the fair value of the liability

recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending & deposit-
related fees over the life of the guarantee contract.The amount of

the liability related to FIN 45 guarantees recorded at December 31,

2008 and 2007,excluding the allowance for lending-related commit-

ments and derivative contracts discussed below,was approximately

$535 million and $335 million,respectively.
Asset purchase agreements
The majority of the Firm™s unfunded commitments are not guarantees

as defined in FIN 45,except for certain asset purchase agreements

that are principally used as a mechanism to provide liquidity to SPEs,

predominantly multi-seller conduits,as described in Note 17 on

pages 189Œ198 of this Annual Report.The conduit™s administrative

agent can require the liquidity provider to perform under their asset

purchase agreement with the conduit at any time.These agreements

may cause the Firm to purchase an asset from the SPE at an amount
above the asset™s then fair value,in effect providing a guarantee of

the initial value of the reference asset as of the date of the agree-

ment.In most instances,third-party credit enhancements of the SPE

mitigate the Firm™s potential losses on these agreements.
The carrying value of asset purchase agreements of $147 million at
December 31,2008,classified in accounts payable and other liabili-

ties on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,includes $9 million for the

allowance for lending-related commitments and $138 million for the

FIN 45 guarantee liability.
Standby letters of credit 
Standby letters of credit (ﬁSBLCﬂ) and financial guarantees are condi-

tional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the per-

formance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements,

such as commercial paper facilities,bond financings,acquisition

financings,trade and similar transactions.The majority of SBLCs

mature in 5 years or less;as of December 31,2008 and 2007,64%

and 52%,respectively,of these arrangements mature within three

years.The Firm has recourse to recover from the customer any

amounts paid under these guarantees;in addition,the Firm may hold

cash or other highly liquid collateral to support these guarantees.The

carrying value of standby letters of credit of $673 million and $590

million at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively,which is classi-

fied in accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated

Balance Sheets,includes $276 million and $255 million at December

31,2008 and 2007,respectively,for the allowance for lending-related

commitments,and $397 million and $335 million at December 31,

2008 and 2007,respectively,for the FIN 45 guarantee.
Notes to consolidated financial statements220JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
In addition to the contracts described above,the Firm transacts cer-

tain derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee

under FIN 45.These contracts include written put options that

require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option hold-
er at a specified price by a specified date in the future.The Firm may

enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs,

or for trading purposes.The terms of written put options are typically

five years or less.Derivative guarantees also include contracts such

as stable value derivatives that require the Firm to make a payment

of the difference between the market value and the book value of a

counterparty™s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market

value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been

met.Stable value derivatives,commonly referred to as ﬁstable value

wrapsﬂ,are transacted in order to allow investors to realize invest-

ment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio,and

typically have a longer-term maturity or allow either party to termi-

nate the contract subject to contractually specified terms.
Derivative guarantees are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value in trading assets and trading liabilities.The total

notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guaran-

tees was $83.8 billion and $85.3 billion at December 31,2008 and

2007,respectively.The notional value generally represents the Firm™s

maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees,although

exposure to certain stable value derivatives is contractually limited to

a substantially lower percentage of the notional value.The fair value

of the contracts reflects the probability of whether the Firm will be

required to perform under the contract.The fair value related to

derivative guarantees was a derivative receivable of $184 million and

$213 million,and a derivative payable of $5.6 billion and $2.5 bil-
lion at December 31,2008 and 2007,respectively.The Firm reduces
exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions,

or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to

the derivative guarantees.
In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a
guarantee under FIN 45,the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of

credit protection in the credit derivatives market.For a further discus-

sion of credit derivatives,see Note 32 on pages 214Œ217 of this

Annual Report.Securities lending indemnification Through the Firm™s securities lending program,customers™ securities,

via custodial and non-custodial arrangements,may be lent to third

parties.As part of this program,the Firm provides an indemnification

in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the fail-
ure of the third-party borrower to return the lent securities in the
event the Firm did not obtain sufficient collateral.To minimize its lia-

bility under these indemnification agreements,the Firm obtains cash

or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100%

of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower.Collateral is

marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is ade-

quate.Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall

exists,or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of

overcollateralization.If a borrower defaults,the Firm would use the

collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to

credit the lending customer with the cash equivalent thereof.
Also,as part of this program,the Firm invests cash collateral received
from the borrower in accordance with approved guidelines.
Based upon historical experience,management believes that risk of
loss under its indemnification obligations is remote.
The following table summarizes the type of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrange

ance risk to the Firm under the guarantee and is based upon the Firm™s internal risk ratings,which generally correspond to rati
ngs defined by S&Pand Moody™s.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
221Indemnification agreements Œ general
In connection with issuing securities to investors,the Firm may enter

into contractual arrangements with third parties that may require the

Firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law

or an adverse interpretation of tax law.In certain cases,the contract

also may include a termination clause,which would allow the Firm

to settle the contract at its fair value in lieu of making a payment

under the indemnification clause.The Firm may also enter into

indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software

to clients (ﬁsoftware licenseesﬂ) or when it sells a business or assets

to a third party (ﬁthird-party purchasersﬂ),pursuant to which it

indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that

may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software,or third-party

purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm

prior to the sale of the business or assets.It is difficult to estimate

the Firm™s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrange-

ments,since this would require an assessment of future changes in

tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that
have not yet occurred.However,based upon historical experience,

management expects the risk of loss to be remote.
Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications
Indemnifications for breaches of representations and warrantiesAs part of the Firm™s loan sale and securitization activities,as
described in Note 14 and Note 16 on pages 175Œ178 and 180Œ188,
respectively,of this Annual Report,the Firm generally makes repre-

sentations and warranties in its loan sale and securitization agree-

ments that the loans sold meet certain requirements.These agree-

ments may require the Firm (including in its roles as a servicer) to
repurchase the loans and/or indemnify the purchaser of the loans
against losses due to any breaches of such representations or war-

ranties.Generally,the maximum amount of future payments the Firm

would be required to make for breaches under these representations

and warranties would be equal to the current amount of assets held

by such securitization-related SPEs plus,in certain circumstances,

accrued and unpaid interest on such loans and certain expense.
At December 31,2008 and 2007,the Firm had recorded a repur-
chase liability of $1.1 billion and $15 million,respectively.
Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial

lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis.In non-

recourse servicing,the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of

temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e.,normal servicing

advances).In recourse servicing,the servicer agrees to share credit

risk with the owner of the mortgage loans,such as the Federal

National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage

Corporation or a private investor,insurer or guarantor.Losses on

recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales pro-
ceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the
sum of the outstanding principal balance,plus accrued interest on

the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying
property.The Firm™s loan sale transactions have primarily been exe-

cuted on a nonrecourse basis,thereby effectively transferring the risk

of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed secu-

rities issued by the trust.At December 31,2008 and 2007,the

unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $15.0
billion and $557 million,respectively.The increase in loans sold with

recourse between December 31,2008 and 2007,was driven by the

Washington Mutual transaction.The carrying value of the related lia-

bility that the Firm had recorded,which is representative of the

Firm™s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under this guar-

antee,was $241 million and zero at December 31,2008 and 2007,

respectively.
Credit card charge-backs 
Prior to November 1,2008,the Firm was a partner with one of the

leading companies in electronic payment services in a joint venture
operating under the name of Chase Paymentech Solutions,LLC (the

ﬁjoint ventureﬂ).The joint venture was formed in October 2005,as a

result of an agreement by the Firm and First Data Corporation,its

joint venture partner,to integrate the companies™ jointly-owned Chase

Merchant Services and Paymentech merchant businesses.The joint

venture provided merchant processing services in the United States
and Canada.The dissolution of the joint venture was completed on

November 1,2008,and JPMorgan Chase retained approximately

51% of the business under the Chase Paymentech Solutions name.
Notes to consolidated financial statements222JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
Under the rules of Visa USA,Inc.,and MasterCard International,
JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,is liable primarily for the amount of each

processed credit card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute

between a cardmember and a merchant.If a dispute is resolved in the

cardmember™s favor,Chase Paymentech Solutions will (through the

cardmember™s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the 

cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.

If Chase Paymentech Solutions is unable to collect the amount from

the merchant,Chase Paymentech Solutions will bear the loss for the

amount credited or refunded to the cardmember.Chase Paymentech

Solutions mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements,retain-

ing cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other security.However,in

the unlikely event that:(1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable

to deliver products,services or a refund;(2) Chase Paymentech

Solutions does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to pro-

vide customer refunds;and (3) Chase Paymentech Solutions does not

have sufficient financial resources to provide customer refunds,

JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A.,would be liable for the amount of the

transaction.For the year ended December 31,2008,Chase

Paymentech Solutions incurred aggregate credit losses of $13 million

on $713.9 billion of aggregate volume processed,and at December

31,2008,it held $222 million of collateral.For the year ended

December 31,2007,the joint venture incurred aggregate credit losses

of $10 million on $719.1 billion of aggregate volume processed,and

at December 31,2007,the joint venture held $779 million of collater-

al.The Firm believes that,based upon historical experience and the

collateral held by Chase Paymentech Solutions,the amount of the

Firm™s charge back-related obligations,which is representative of the

payment or performance risk to the Firm,is immaterial.
Credit card association,exchange and clearinghouse 
guarantees

The Firm holds an equity interest in VISA Inc.During October 2007,

certain VISA-related entities completed a series of restructuring

transactions to combine their operations,including VISA USA,under

one holding company,VISA Inc.Upon the restructuring,the Firm™s

membership interest in VISA USA was converted into an equity inter-

est in VISA Inc.VISA Inc.sold shares via an initial public offering and

used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to redeem a portion
of the Firm™s equity interest in Visa Inc.Prior to the restructuring,

VISA USA™s by-laws obligated the Firm upon demand by VISA USA to

indemnify VISA USA for,among other things,litigation obligations of

Visa USA.The accounting for that guarantee was not subject to fair

value accounting under FIN 45,because the guarantee was in effect

prior to the effective date of FIN 45.Upon the restructuring event,

the Firm™s obligation to indemnify Visa Inc.was limited to certain

identified litigations.Such a limitation is deemed a modification of

the indemnity by-law and,accordingly,is now subject to the provi-

sions of FIN 45.The value of the litigation guarantee has been

recorded in the Firm™s financial statements based on its fair value;

the net amount recorded (within other liabilities) did not have a
material adverse effect on the Firm™s financial statements.
In addition to Visa,the Firm is a member of other associations,
including several securities and futures exchanges and clearinghous-

es,both in the United States and other countries.Membership in

some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share

of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of
another member.Such obligations vary with different organizations.

These obligations may be limited to members who dealt with the

defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of
the Firm™s contribution to a member™s guarantee fund,or,in a few

cases,the obligation may be unlimited.It is difficult to estimate the

Firm™s maximum exposure under these membership agreements,

since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be
made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.However,based

upon historical experience,management expects the risk of loss to

be remote.
Residual value guarantee
In connection with the Bear Stearns merger,the Firm succeeded to

an operating lease arrangement for the building located at 383

Madison Avenue in New York City (the ﬁSynthetic Leaseﬂ).Under the

terms of the Synthetic Lease,the Firm is obligated to make periodic

payments based on the lessor™s underlying interest costs.The

Synthetic Lease expires on November 1,2010.Under the terms of

the Synthetic Lease,the Firm has the right to purchase the building

for the amount of the then outstanding indebtedness of the lessor,or

to arrange for the sale of the building,with the proceeds of the sale

to be used to satisfy the lessor™s debt obligation.If the sale does not

generate sufficient proceeds to satisfy the lessor™s debt obligation,

the Firm is required to fund the shortfall up to a maximum residual
value guarantee.As of December 31,2008,there was no expected

shortfall,and the maximum residual value guarantee was approxi-

mately $670 million.Under a separate ground lease,the land on

which the building is built was leased to an affiliate of Bear Stearns

which,as part of the Synthetic Lease,assigned this position to the

Synthetic Lease lessor.The owner of the land sued the Firm,alleging

that certain provisions of the merger agreement violated a ﬁright of

first offerﬂprovision of the ground lease.The Firm™s motion to dis-

miss the lawsuit was granted,and a judgment of dismissal was

entered on January 12,2009.The owner has filed a notice of appeal.
Note 34 Œ Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are

engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geo-
graphic region,or when they have similar economic features that

would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be simi-

larly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit
portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collat-

eral when deemed necessary.Senior management is significantly

involved in the credit approval and review process,and risk levels are

adjusted as needed to reflect management™s risk tolerance.
www.global-reports.com
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
223In the Firm™s wholesale portfolio,risk concentrations are evaluated
primarily by industry and geographic region,and monitored regularly

on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual customer
basis.Management of the Firm™s wholesale exposure is accom-

plished through loan syndication and participation,loan sales,

securitizations,credit derivatives,use of master netting agreements,

and collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.In the consumer

portfolio,concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by

U.S.geographic region,with a key focus on trends and concentra-

tions at the portfolio level,where potential risk concentrations can

be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio
guidelines.
The Firm does not believe exposure to any one loan product with vary-
ing terms (e.g.,interest-only payments for an introductory period,

option ARMs) or exposure to loans with high loan-to-value ratios

would result in a significant concentration of credit risk.Terms of loan

products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm™s assessment

when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.
For further information regarding on-balance sheet credit concentra-
tions by major product and geography,see Note 14 on pages

175Œ178 and Note 15 on pages 178Œ180 of this Annual Report.For

information regarding concentrations of off-balance sheet lending-

related financial instruments by major product,see Note 33 on pages

218Œ222 of this Annual Report.

Note 35 Œ International operations 
The following table presents income statement information of JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area.The Firm def
ines interna-tional activities as business transactions that involve customers residing outside of the U.S.,and the information presented be
low is based prima-rily upon the domicile of the customer or the location from which the customer relationship is managed.However,many of the Firm
™s U.S.opera-
tions serve international businesses.
As the Firm™s operations are highly integrated,estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and exp

Parent Company received dividends of $15 million,$18 million and $23 million from the

issuer trusts in 2008,2007 and 2006,respectively.For further discussion on these issuer

trusts,see Note 23 on page 204 of this Annual Report.

level.There was no change to net income as the increase in Parent Company profitability

was offset by a decrease in the net income of subsidiaries.

(d)On September 25,2008,JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual from the FDIC for $1.9 billion.The 
fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price,
which resulted in negative goodwill.In accordance with SFAS 141,nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale,such as premises
 and equipment and other intangibles,acquired in the Washington
Mutual transaction were written down against that negative goodwill.The negative goodwill that remained after writing down nonf
inancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain.
(e)Included a $1.5 billion charge to conform Washington Mutual™s loan loss reserve to JPMorgan Chase™s allowance methodology.

(f)In November 2008,the Firm transferred $5.8 billion of higher quality credit card loans from the legacy Chase portfolio to a 
securitization trust previously established by Washington Mutual (ﬁthe Trustﬂ).
As a result of converting higher credit quality Chase-originated on-book receivables to the Trust™s seller™s interest which has
 a higher overall loss rate reflective of the total assets within the Trust,approxi-
mately $400 million of incremental provision expense was recorded during the fourth quarter.This incremental provision expense 
was recorded in Corporate segment as the action related to the acquisi-
tion of Washington Mutual™s banking operations.For further discussion of credit card securitizations,see Note 16 on page 182 of
 this Annual Report.
(g)Managed results for credit card exclude the impact of CS securitizations on total net revenue,provision for credit losses an
d average assets,as JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they 
were still on the balance sheet in evaluating the credit performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio as operations 
are funded,and decisions are made about allocating resources such as
employees and capital,based upon managed information.These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Fir
m™s reported U.S.GAAP results.The related securitization adjustments
were as follows.

the additional equity interest in Highbridge.At the end of the third

quarter of 2008,equity was increased for each line of business with a

view toward the future implementation of the new Basel II capital rules.

In addition,equity allocated to RFS,CS and CB was increased as a

result of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Mark-to-market exposure:

but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a

traditional prime loan.Alt-A lending characteristics may include one

or more of the following:(i) limited documentation;(ii) high com-

bined-loan-to-value (ﬁCLTVﬂ) ratio;(iii) loans secured by non-owner

occupied properties;or (iv) debt-to-income ratio above normal limits.

loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make
Glossary of terms232JPMorgan Chase & Co./2008 Annual Report
a fully amortizing,interest-only,or minimum payment.The minimum
payment on an option ARM loan is based upon the interest rate

charged during the introductory period.This introductory rate has usu-

ally been significantly below the fully indexed rate.The fully indexed

rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin.Once the intro-

ductory period ends,the contractual interest rate charged on the loan

increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect

movements in the index.The minimum payment is typically insufficient

to cover interest accrued in the prior month,and any unpaid interest

is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan.PrimePrime mortgage loans generally have low default risk and are made

to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income that is
at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing
expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments).

able payment histories.

characteristics (e.g.,FICO score,geographic location).A pool is then

accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate

and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Wholesale loans were

determined to be credit-impaired if they met the definition of an
impaired loan under SFAS 114 at the acquisition date.Consumer
