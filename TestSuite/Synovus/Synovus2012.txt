Synovus Financial Corp. is a financial services company with 
 approximately $27 billion in assets based in Columbus, Georgia. 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Bank, member 

FDIC, the company provides commercial and retail banking 

in addition to a full suite of specialized products and services 

including private banking, treasury management, asset-based 

lending, wealth management, and international banking. Synovus 

also offers mortgage services, financial planning, and investment 

advisory services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, 

Synovus Mortgage, GLOBALT Investments, Synovus Trust, and 

Synovus Securities.  These specialized offerings, combined with 

our traditional banking products and services, make Synovus 

Bank a great choice for retail and commercial customers. 
Synovus Bank’s 29 locally branded divisions are positioned in 
some of the best markets in the Southeast, with 283 offices and 

400 ATMs in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, and 

Tennessee. See Synovus on the web at
 www.synovus.com.
Dear Shareholders,
Our company began 125 years ago this September with a simple act of kindness between a worker 
and an executive at a Columbus, Georgia textile mill.  
The worker’s dress became tangled in factory machinery, and money she had sewn into her hem 
spilled onto the floor. Explaining she felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, a mill executive 

offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest. That same service was 

soon offered to all the workers, and those deposits marked the beginning of Synovus.
Since 1888, we have remained committed to serving others, offering financial solutions, and building 
trusting relationships with team members, customers, and shareholders. On those same guiding 

principles, we built a full-service banking institution that today operates in five states across the 

Southeast; yet, because of our relationship-driven, community banking model, in the more than 100 

communities we serve, we are still the local bank.
The year 2012 was truly a transformational time for our company, representing the culmination of 
years of hard work by our dedicated and highly skilled team, including the  sale of distressed assets 

totaling approximately $920 million, the recapture of $803 million of our deferred tax asset (DTA), 

significant improvement in all credit quality metrics, and continued progress in our key efficiency 

efforts. As a result of these accomplishments, we reported net income of $771.5 million for the year. 

And, already in the first quarter of 2013, both Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services 

(S&P) changed their outlooks on Synovus to Positive, and S&P also upgraded its long-term and 

short-term Issuer Default Ratings by one level    .
In this year’s shareholders’ report, we will take a look back at our significant progress over the past 
few years, and a look ahead at our strategy for growth and sustained profitability. 
A LOOK BACK 
We began to gain positive traction towards profitability during 2010 by successfully implementing 

strategic steps that both stabilized and positioned our company for short-term recovery and long-

term growth. 
We consolidated 30 bank charters into one, increasing efficiencies and lowering risk with streamlined 
processes throughout our bank network. Over the last four years, we have strengthened our balance 

sheet by raising $1.ommon equity, 

essed assets. 
 The efficiency initiatives we began in 2011 have resulted in mor million in annualized 
expense savings by the end of 2012, which included eliminating more than 1, positions. We never 

take lightly the decision to reduce headcount, but our actions were necessary to better align our 

operating costs with the current size of our organization. 
We announced plans in January of 2011 to further refine our commercial banking strategy to grow 
loans and diversify our portfolio. We recruited additional, highly seasoned talent that expands our 

reach and better equips us to serve commercial customers and prospects in the middle market and 

specialty industries. This includes specialists in senior housing, asset-based lending, and syndicated 

lending. 
The year 
2012 was truly a 
 transformational time
 for our company, representing
 the culmination of years
 of hard work by our dedicated
 and highly skilled team.

 - 2012 Annual Report
Message from the Chairman, 
President,  and
 Chief Executive Officer
In the third quarter of 2011, we announced our return to profitability.  The reaching of this major 
milestone represented the tremendous efforts of our dedicated team members who never 

wavered in their commitment to execute on our strategic plans and restore this company to a 

position of strength. 
    During 2012, our new business pipeline began to expand thanks to the combined efforts of our 
traditional and specialty bankers.  This encouraging trend was a direct result of our aggressive 

work to deal with problem credits in a more centralized manner so our lenders could spend more 

time focused on growth.  Our bankers grew net loans by $588.8
(1)   million in 2012 compared to a 
net decline of $370.9 
(1) million in 2011. The improvement in our credit quality metrics accelerated 
during 2012, with a 37% decline in non-performing assets, a 32% reduction in non-performing loan 

inflows, and a 24% decrease in credit costs.  We significantly de-risked our portfolio as evidenced 

by improvements in risk-grade and asset-class distributions, and a reduction in large borrower 

concentrations.  As a result, our pass-rated credits increased bybillion in 2012.  At year-end, 

Synovus Bank’ s classified assets ratio
(2) decreased to 38.1% compared to 62.5% a year ago.      We 
expect continued meaningful improvement in credit quality in 2013.
We continued to see a favorable trend in lower cost deposits. Core deposits excluding time deposits 
increased $344 million year over year, and the weighted average cost
 of core deposits
(3) for the full 
year 2012 declined to 38 basis points, down from 63 basis points in 2011.
 Brokered deposits ended 
the year at only 5.2% of total deposits compared to 8.0% a year ago. These trends, along with our 

team’ s ability to remain solidly positioned in our markets by maintaining top five deposit market 

share in communities that represent almost 80% of our core banking franchise, reflect the strength 

of our company, the loyalty of our customers, and the overall health of our deposit base.
We generated approximately $9 million in additional core banking fees in 2012 as we continued to 
align customers with appropriate products and services that bring value and meet their financial 

needs.  Contributors to growth in fee income included our restructured checking accounts and 

the introduction of our brand new Synovus Connections pre-paid card.  Late last year, we also 

redesigned our websites which included a more robust consumer online banking product, making 

it even easier for customers to manage their personal finances. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, we recaptured $803 million of our DTA reflecting management’s 
confidence in the sustainability of Synovus’ continued profitability and credit quality improvement. 

The recapture of the DTA was a significant milestone that drove our reported $771.5 million in net 

income and the improvement in our tangible book value per share to $2.95 compared to $2.02 a year 

ago. In December 2012, we completed the sale 
of distressed assets of approximately $545 million 
to further strengthen our balance sheet, improve asset quality, and enhance our future earnings. We 

also confirmed our expectation to exit the TARP program no later than the end of 2013. 
Even as we navigated through the challenges of the past few years, our team members continued to 
demonstrate their passion for service and never lost their connection with our brand of high-touch, 

personal banking.  As a testament to their dedication to building loyal customer relationships, in 

2012, we received 21 awards from Greenwich Associates for excellence in middle market and small 

business banking, up from 13 awards in 2011; and Bloomberg Markets magazine recognized our 

Family Asset Management team as one of the ‘ Top 50 Family Offices’  in the world. 
  A FOCUS ON GROWTH IN 2013
We entered this year with solid momentum, knowing the slowly improving economic conditions 
create continued headwinds that will challenge our entire industry. But we are moving confidently 

ahead, focused on key areas that will drive growth: growing customer relationships; continuing our 

efficiency efforts; and attracting, developing, and retaining the top bankers, financial advisors, and 

support team in the industry.

GROWING  CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
There is nothing more important this year than continuing to earn the trust and confidence of 
customers to be their bankers and financial advisors. Relationships are important, especially to 

middle market and small business owners, and our ability to offer local leadership, local decisions, 

and flexible solutions gives Synovus an edge over “big” banks. We interact with our customers just 

like a community bank, while our resources, expertise, products, and services are on par with our 

larger competitors. This unique position gives us a clear advantage in creating mutually-beneficial, 

long-term customer relationships.
In 2013, we are keenly focused on providing needs-based financial solutions that leverage the 
expertise and the many products and services we offer. Retention rates are higher, and opportunities 

for revenue growth greater, when there are multiple touch points with customers, and we have 

the right team of traditional and specialty line bankers and investment experts who can partner 

together to meet any retail or commercial customer need, large or small. Our total customer 

relationship approach is key to growing loans, core deposits, and fee income this year and beyond, 

and our traditional banking products and services – combined with trust, mortgage, investment 

management, financial planning, and insurance – provide diverse revenue streams for our company. 
Our Financial Management Services (FMS) line of business has long been an important component 
of our full financial services delivery model and a valuable source of revenue for the bank.  Our FMS 

expertise is especially robust as it extends beyond traditional investment, insurance and money 

management services.  GLOBALT Investments, our Atlanta-based affiliate, specializes in creating 

and managing diversified asset allocation strategies for high net worth individual and commercial 

clients. GLOBALT is one of the most active money managers using exchange-traded funds (ETF), 

and has expanded its marketing efforts beyond our own Synovus Securities brokers to external 

brokerage companies and their large networks of brokers and financial consultants across the 

country.    Our Creative Financial team, also based in Atlanta, specializes in comprehensive financial 

planning and asset management services for business executives, and provides a unique level 

of service to meet the complex financial needs of clients in this market niche.   Finally, our Family 

Asset Management team is highly-credentialed and widely recognized for its ability to fully care 

for the wealth management needs of multi-generational families.
To add to these already specialized and comprehensive FMS offerings, this year, we are extending 
our reach and enhancing our level of service to individuals interested in the creation, management, 

and transfer of wealth. Cross-functional teams are being positioned in markets across our footprint 

where there are the greatest concentrations of this potential client base.  These teams are specially 

designed to offer one-stop banking and investment expertise to clients seeking personalized 

service, highly-skilled advisors, and added convenience.  
Additionally during 2013, we are expanding and enhancing core products like HELOCs and jumbo 
mortgages to better meet the needs of our growing customer base; and, as consumer behaviors 

change and reliance on traditional branch banking declines, we are making significant new 

investments in technology so customers can transact with us no matter when they need us and no 

matter where they are. Major initiatives this year include the completion of the rollout of our new, 

highly functional ATM fleet, and a significantly improved and more convenient call center channel. 

We are planning to expand our mobile banking features as well to include a tablet application, 

and new payment and deposit capabilities. And in the second half of the year, we will fully launch 

Synovus Connect, a suite of products and services designed specifically for the underbanked 

market segment.
          CONTINUING EFFICIENCY EFFORTS
We continue to emphasize that efficiency is key to sustained profitability . It is as important to our 

financial performance as building relationships and selling products and services – the two are not 

mutually exclusive.  We are committed in 2013 to new expense savings of approximately $30 million 

through further refining our banking model while strategically investing in talent and infrastructure 

that improves our customers’ experience and generates growth.

 - 2012 Annual Report
ATTRACTING, DEVELOPING, RETAINING TOP TALENT  
The response of our team members to the challenges of the past few years has been nothing 
short of inspiring. We remain committed to fostering a work environment where the best bankers, 

financial advisors, and support staff in the industry want to build life-long careers. 
Last year, we intensified our  formal leadership training that will continue in 2013, and we are also 
enhancing our reward and recognition programs this year. We want solid, long-term customer 

relationships, and we know the key to earning those is having team members who feel cared for 

and fulfilled in their work lives, and who then extend that feeling of satisfaction to their customers.
 We also continue our strong support and encouragement for team member involvement in the 
economic development and betterment of the communities we serve. Through our REACH 

program (Recognizing and Encouraging an Atmosphere of Community and of Hope), our 

team members are  able to volunteer , lead, contribute, and enjoy using their gifts, talents, and 

resources to support various events and causes in their markets. This strengthens our company’s 

relationships with our local communities and meets an important need in our team members to 

fulfill a higher calling.APPRECIATION FOR SERVICE
Before I close, I would like to recognize two individuals who will be retiring from the Synovus Board 

of Directors after our upcoming Shareholders’ Meeting. I am grateful for the combined 35 years 

of board service  from Frank Brumley and H. Lynn Page. As our Lead Director, Frank’s extensive 

experience in banking and commercial real estate provided invaluable insight and expertise to 

our board, which was especially useful during the recent economic challenges we faced. Lynn 

retired from Synovus after 25 years of service as a team member and executive leader, and was 

instrumental in the development of our payment processing line of business. His vast knowledge of 

the banking industry has been a valuable resource for our executive management team throughout 

his tenure. Our company has benefited from Frank and Lynn’ s many contributions, and their 
 leadership will be greatly missed.
IN CLOSING
During the first few months of the year, I had the honor of visiting leaders in almost every market 

throughout our footprint to thank them for what they have done and what they will do in the 

coming years.  Our message is clear: our company has proven we can survive and that we can 

overcome nearly every challenge before us. But the true measure of our team’s success will not be 

based on what we have done the last few years, but what we will do in the years ahead. Growth will 

not come easily, but our plans are in place, our priorities are appropriately aligned, and our team 

is energized and ready. Synovus has, without question, made great strides and is well-positioned 

to be successful in this very difficult economy and highly competitive industry. The world has 

changed, and where necessary, our company has and continues to change with it. But our guiding 

principles established 125 years ago on the basis of serving others and building trust have  never 

and will never change. 
Thank you for your continued loyalty and support.  

Sincerely,
Kessel D. Stelling

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which 
are not statements of historical fact, including those under “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” 
and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within 
the meaning of, and subject to the pr27A of the 
21E of the Exchange Act. 
Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus’ 
beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, 
assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve 
known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus’ control and 
which may cause Synovus’ actual results, performance or achievements 
or the commercial banking industry or economy generally, to be materially 
different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or 

implied by such forward-looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking 
statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through 
Synovus’ use of words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “may,” 
“will,” “assumes,” “predicts,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “intends,” “targets,” 
“estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “potential” and other similar words and 
expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus’ 
future business and ﬁ nancial performance and/or the performance of the 
commercial banking industry and economy in general. Forward-looking 
statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus’ 
management and are subject to signiﬁ cant risks and uncertainties. Actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-
looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in 
this document. Many of these factors are beyond Synovus’ ability to control 
or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to:
(1) further deterioration in credit quality may result in increased non-
performing assets and credit losses, which could adversely impact 
our capital, ﬁ nancial condition, and results of operations;
(2)
 the risk that our allowance for loan losses may prove to be inadequate 
or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures;
(3)
 further declines in the values of residential and commercial real estate 
may result in further write-downs of assets and realized losses on 
disposition of non-performing assets, which may increase credit 
losses and negatively affect our ﬁ nancial results;

 Business
OverviewGeneralSynovus Financial Corp. is a ﬁ nancial services company and a registered 
bank holding company headquartered in Columbus, Georgia. We provide 
integrated ﬁ nancial services including commercial and retail banking, ﬁ nancial 
management, insurance and mortgage services to our customers through 
locally-branded banking divisions of our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, 
Synovus Bank, and other ofﬁ ces in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, 
Florida and Tennessee.
Our relationship-driven community banking model is built on creating 
long-term relationships with our customers. This relationship banking 
approach allows our bankers to serve their customers’ individual needs 
and demonstrates our commitment to the communities in which we 
operate. We believe that these factors position us to take advantage of 
future growth opportunities in our existing markets.
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in 1972. Our 
principal executive ofﬁ ces are located at 1111 Bay Avenue, Suite 500, 
Columbus, Georgia 31901 and our telephone number at that address is

Exchange under the symbol “SNV.”
2012 Business HighlightsDuring 2012, Synovus achieved signiﬁ cant accomplishments as we 
continued to recover from a challenging economy. Our key achievements 
during 2012 include the following: •Continued proﬁ 
– We reported net income for the year ended 
million comparmillion 
2011, and have now reported six 
consecutive quarters of proﬁ tability.
 •– We recorded a 
million income tax beneﬁ t driven by the reversal of substantially 
all of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 
2012. The reversal of the valuation allowance reﬂ ects conﬁ dence in our 
ability to generate sufﬁ cient levels of future proﬁ tability and continued 
improvement in credit quality. The reversal of the deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance helped drive our tangible book value per common share from $2.07 per share at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 
2012 to $2.95 per shar7.

Business DevelopmentSynovus has traditionally focused on a strategy that includes expanding and diversifying its franchise in terms of revenues, proﬁ tability and asset 
size while maintaining a community banking, relationship-based approach 
to banking. This strategy has encompassed both organic growth and 
acquisitions of complementary banks and ﬁ nancial services businesses. 
During the 1990’s and through 2006, Synovus’ growth resulted largely 
from acquisitions of smaller community banks. As a result of the economic 
crisis that began in 2008, Synovus has refocused its efforts on initiatives to 
increase revenue through organic growth, lower its cost structure, reduce 
its concentration of CRE loans, strengthen its balance sheet and capital 
position and aggressively reduce non-performing assets.
Lending ActivitiesOverviewThe primary goal of Synovus’ lending function is to help clients achieve their ﬁ nancial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the 
client and proﬁ table to Synovus. Management believes that this purpose 
can best be accomplished by building strong, proﬁ table client relationships 
over time and maintaining a strong presence and position of inﬂ uence in the 
communities Synovus serves. Synovus strives to serve all of its customers with the highest levels of courtesy, respect, gratitude and fairness and 
deliver its services with unparalleled expertise, efﬁ ciency, responsiveness 
and accuracy. This relationship-based approach to banking enables 
Synovus’ bankers to develop a deep knowledge of Synovus’ customers and the markets in which they operate. Synovus has processes to ensure 
consistency of its lending processes across all of its banking divisions, 
to maintain strong underwriting criteria to evaluate new loans and loan 
renewals, and to diversify its loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and 
geographical concentration. Synovus believes that these measures better 
position Synovus to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in 
the markets it serves while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan proﬁ tability, 
loan growth and loan quality.
Synovus conducts the majority of its lending activities within the framework 
of its relationship-based approach to banking, built on creating long-term 
relationships with its customers. The following tables summarize Synovus’

7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report.Underwriting Approach
Recognizing that its loan portfolio is the primary source of revenue, Synovus’ 
management believes that proper and consistent loan underwriting 
throughout Synovus’ banking divisions is critical to Synovus’ long-term 
ﬁ nancial success. Synovus’ underwriting approach is designed to effectively 
govern the degree of assumed risk and ensure that its credit relationships 
conform to Synovus’ overall risk philosophy. During 2009 and 2010, Synovus 
transitioned its underwriting standards and key underwriting functions from 
a decentralized bank-by-bank approach to a more centralized regional 
approach and, ﬁ nally, to a centralized organization-wide approach with the 
completion of the Charter Consolidation. These underwriting standards 
address collateral requirements; guarantor requirements (including policies 
on ﬁ nancial statements, tax returns, and limited guarantees); requirements 
regarding appraisals and their review; loan approval hierarchy; standard 
consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria (including 
credit score thresholds, maximum maturity and amortization, loan-to-value 
limits, global service coverage, and debt to income limits); commercial real 
estate and C&I underwriting guidelines (including minimum debt service coverage ratio, maximum amortization, minimum equity requirements, 
maximum loan-to-value ratios); lending limits; and credit approval authorities. 
Additionally, Synovus has implemented an enhanced loan concentration 
policy to limit and manage its exposure to certain loan concentrations, 
including commercial real estate. The enhanced loan concentration policy 
provides a more detailed program for portfolio risk management and 
reporting including limits on commercial real estate loans as a percentage 
of risk-based capital (in the aggregate and by loan type), large borrower 
concentration limits and monitoring, as well as portfolio mix monitoring. Synovus’ underwriting process is structured to require oversight that is 
proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship.
Synovus utilizes a tiered credit approval process requiring larger loans 
to be approved by more senior bank ofﬁ cers as well as an independent 
senior credit ofﬁ cer, with the largest loans requiring approval of Synovus 
Bank’s Credit Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, 
the Chief Banking Ofﬁ cer, the Chief Commercial Banking Ofﬁ cer, and other 
key executives of Synovus Bank. The centralized underwriting policy and philosophy also provides a structured, conservative approach to lending. 
For instance, loan-to-value limits on certain credits are lower than regulatory 
requirements, large borrower concentration limits are explicit, and bank 
division lending limits are lower than before the credit crisis. Furthermore, 
Synovus has established across all of its banking divisions more stringent 
underwriting requirements on certain types of commercial real estate lending, 
including loans for the purpose of ﬁ nancing shopping centers and hotels.
Prior to 2009, each of our banking divisions had its own underwriting 
standards. While these separate underwriting standards were generally similar 
to each other and were all in compliance with regulatory requirements, the 
transition to uniform underwriting standards emphasizes a one-company 
view of our operating structure and promotes greater consistency throughout 
Synovus’ underwriting process.

Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Loan 
PortfolioThe C&I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus’ total loan 
portfolio. Synovus’ C&I loan portfolio is currently concentrated on small to 
middle market commercial and industrial lending disbursed throughout a 
diverse group of industries in the Southeast, including health care, ﬁ nance 
and insurance, manufacturing, construction, real estate leasing and retail 
trade. The portfolio is relationship focused and, as a result, Synovus’ lenders 
have in-depth knowledge of the borrowers, most of which have guaranty 
arrangements. C&I loans are primarily originated through Synovus’ local 
market banking divisions and made to commercial customers primarily to 
ﬁ nance capital expenditures, including real property, plant and equipment, 
or as a sour2012, 19.4% of 
Synovus’ total C&I loans represented loans for the purpose of ﬁ nancing 
owner-occupied properties. The primary source of repayment on these 
C&I loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the 
borrower’s business. The secondary source of repayment on these C&I 
loans is the real estate securing such loans. In accordance with Synovus’ 
uniform lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, 
which incorporates the uniform underwriting approach, procedures and 
evaluations described above. Approximately 93% of Synovus’ C&I loans 
are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types 
of collateral. T2012 werbillion, or 
46.5%, of the total loan portfolio.C&I lending is a key component of Synovus’ growth and diversiﬁ cation 
strategy (reducing overall concentration in CRE and growing the percentage 
of C&I loans relative to the total loan portfolio). Synovus has actively invested 
in additional expertise, product offerings, and product quality to provide its 
commercial and industrial clients with increased and enhanced product 
offerings and customer service. Complementing this investment in C&I 
growth, Synovus’ management continues to focus on streamlining and 
enhancing Synovus’ existing product lines, especially for traditional retail, 
small business and professional services customers.
During 2011, Synovus formed the Corporate Banking Group to complement 
its core banking talent and further diversify and grow the C&I portfolio. 
Loans outstanding from the Corporate Banking Group increased to 
2012, comparmillion at 
2011. The Corporate Banking Group provides lending 
solutions to larger corporate clients, and includes specialty units such as syndications and senior housing. These units partner with Synovus’ local bankers to build relationships across the ﬁ ve-state footprint, as 
well as the southeastern and southwestero-date, loan 
syndications consist primarily of loans where Synovus is participating in the 
crSenior housing loans are typically extended 
to borrowers in the assisted living or skilled nursing facilities sectors. The 
Corporate Banking Group also originates loans and participates in loans 
to well-capitalized public companies and larger private companies that operate in the ﬁ ve-state footprint as well as other states in the Southeast.
Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio
Synovus’ commercial real estate loans consist of investment property loans, 
residential construction and development loans, land acquisition loans, 
and 1-4 family perm/mini-perm loans. As is the case with Synovus’ C&I loans, the commercial real estate loans are primarily originated through 
Synovus Bank’s local market banking divisions. Total commercial real 
2012 werbillion, or 33.0%, of 
the total loan portfolio.Investment Property Loans
Synovus’ investment property loans are primarily made to ﬁ nance multi-
family properties, hotels, ofﬁ ce buildings, shopping centers, warehouses 
and other commercial development properties. Synovus’ investment 
property portfolio is well diversiﬁ ed with no concentration by property type, 
geography (other than the fact that most of these loans are in Synovus’ 
primary market areas of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, 
and Florida) or tenants. These loans are generally recourse in nature with 
years or less), allowing for restructuring opportunities 
which reduces Synovus’ overall risk exposure. The investment property 
loans are primarily secured by the property being ﬁ nanced by the loans; 
however, they may also be secured by real estate or other assets beyond 
the property being ﬁ nanced. Investment property loans are subject to the 
same uniform lending policies and procedures described above, although 
such loans have historically been underwritten with stressed interest 
rates and vacancies. All investment prmillion or more 
are reviewed quarterly to more closely monitor the performance of the 
portfolio. Total investment pr2012 were 
Residential Construction and Development and Land 
Acquisition LoansThe residential construction and development loans and land acquisition 
loans are almost always secured by the underlying property being ﬁ nanced 
by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets 
served by Synovus. Although housing and real estate markets in the 
ﬁ ve southeastern states within Synovus’ footprint are showing signs of 
stabilization, Synovus has actively worked to reduce its exposure (including 
its exposure in historically high loss markets such as Atlanta) to these types 
of loans. These loans are generally subject to the same uniform lending 
policies and procedures described above. Land acquisition loans have a 
maximum loan-to-value limit which is aligned with regulatory requirements.

Retail Loan PortfolioSynovus’ retail loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products 
offered through its banking network, including residential mortgages, home 
equity lines, credit card loans, and other retail loans. These various types 
of secured and unsecured retail loans are marketed to qualifying existing 
clients and to other creditworthy candidates in Synovus’ market area. The 
majority of Synovus’ retail loans are consumer mortgages secured by ﬁ rst 
and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets 
served by Synovus in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, and 
Tennessee. Total r2012 werbillion,

ratios based upon prudent guidelines to ensure consistency with Synovus’ 
overall risk philosophy. Apart from credit card loans and unsecured loans, 
Synovus does not originate loans with LTV ratios greater than 100% at 
origination except for infrequent situations provided that certain underwriting 
requirements are met. Additionally, at origination, loan maturities are 
determined based on the borrower’s ability to repay (cash ﬂ ow or earning 
power of the borrower that represents the primary source of repayment) 
and the collateralization of the loan, including the economic life of the asset 
being pledged. Collateral securing these loans provides a secondary source 
of repayment in that the collateral may be liquidated. Synovus determines 
the need for collateral on a case-by-case basis. Factors considered include 
the purpose of the loan, current and prospective credit-worthiness of the 
customer, terms of the loan, and economic conditions.
Mortgage BankingSynovus Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Mortgage, originates 
rbillion in 2012. 
Synovus Mortgage offers various types of ﬁ xed- and adjustable-rate loans 
for the purposes of purchasing, reﬁ nancing or constructing residential 
properties. The originated loans are primarily conforming mortgage loans 
for owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans that are 
underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by 
government sponsored entities such as the Federal National Mortgage 
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. These loans are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real 
estate properties and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without 
recourse, or continuing involvement. Each purchaser of our mortgage 
loans has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans, and the 
risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold 
is generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans 
are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus 
Mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the 
existence and sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud 
by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with 
obtaining the loan. If it is determined that the loans sold were in breach of 
these representations or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations 
to either repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance and related 
investor fees or make the purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of 
the loan. To date, Synovus has experienced minimal repurchase activity in 
its consumer mortgage lending operations. Additionally, foreclosure activity 
in the home equity and consumer mortgage loan portfolios has been low.

originates loans with the intent to hold those loans for the foreseeable 
future. Loans or pools of distressed loans are transferred to the other 
loans held for sale portfolio when management makes the decision to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans. The value of the loans or pools of loans 
is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of the loan and the anticipated market prices of similar assets less estimated costs to sell. At the time of transfer, if the fair value less selling costs is less than 
the carrying amount of the speciﬁ c loans, with such difference generally 
being attributable to declines in credit quality, the shortfall is recorded as

Synovus continuously monitors credit quality and maintains an allowance 
for loan losses that management believes is sufﬁ cient to absorb probable 
and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Synovus continues to 
address problem assets and reduce future exposures through its asset 
disposition strategy, which centers around the disposition of distressed 
assets, as a proactive measure in managing the loan portfolio. Subsequent 
to the implementation of the asset disposition strategy, Synovus entered 
into the Synovus MOU. The Synovus MOU was in alignment with the 
existing asset disposition strategy, including managing various asset 
quality and regulatory capital ratios. The asset disposition program is 
still in place today. Net charge-offs recorded during the three years 
2012 related to this strategy were approximately 
million. For a more detailed discussion of Synovus’ credit quality,

further information.Monitoring of CollateralSynovus’ loan portfolio and the collateral securing such loans is predominately 
located in a ﬁ ve state market consisting of Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, 
Alabama, and Tennessee. C&I loans represent 46.5% of the total loan 
2012. These loans are predominately secured 
by owner-occupied and other real estate. Other types of collateral securing 
these loans consist primarily of marketable equipment, marketable inventory, 
accounts receivable, equity and debt securities, and time deposits. Total 
commercial real estate loans represent 33.0% of the total loan portfolio at 
2012. These loans are primarily secured by commercial real 
estate, including 1-4 family properties, land, and investment properties. 
The collateral generally consists of the property being ﬁ nanced by the 
loans; however, collateral may also include real estate or other assets 
beyond the property being ﬁ 2012 
billion, or 20.5%, of the total loan portfolio. Of this amount, 
billion consists of consumer mortgages secured by ﬁ rst and second 
liens on residential real estate. Credit card loans reprmillion 
of this amount and these loans are generally unsecured. Small business 
million, an increase of 
million or 71.9% compar2011. The increase 
in small business loans is partially due to a reclassiﬁ cation of C&I loans 
which are now underwritten using a business credit scoring system and 
thus are reported as small business loans, a component of retail loans. 
million of these loans were reclassiﬁ ed from the C&I 
portfolio to retail small business loans. As these small business loans 
included as a component of commercial and industrial loans are renewed or 
reﬁ nanced, they will be classiﬁ ed as small business loans, a component of 
retail loans. Other retail loans reprmillion of this amount, and 
they are primarily secured by collateral consisting of marketable securities, 
automobiles, time deposits, and cash surrender value of life insurance.
Synovus follows a risk-based approach as it relates to the credit monitoring 
processes for its loan portfolio. Synovus updates the fair value of the real 
estate collateral securing collateral-dependent impaired loans each calendar 
quarter, with appraisals usually received on an annual basis, or sooner if 
appropriate, from an independent, unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser. 
Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such

as selling costs and anticipated sales values considering management’s 
plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments to the collateral 
value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Synovus updates the value of collateral that is in the form of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, 
and cash surrender value of life insurance policies at least annually and 
the value of collateral that is in the form of marketable securities and 
brokerage accounts at least quarterly.
It is the Company’s policy to obtain, on at least an annual basis, an 
updated appraisal from an independent, unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed 
appraiser for loan rmillion and over when at least one 
of the loans in the relationship is on non-accrual status. For relationships 
million, while independent appraisals are not mandated by 
the Company’s policies, management will obtain such appraisals when 
considered prudent. For credits that are not on impaired status, Synovus 
generally obtains an unafﬁ liated third-party appraisal of the value of the 
real estate collateral prior to each loan renewal. Additionally, if conditions 
warrant (e.g., loans that are not considered impaired but exhibit a higher 
or potentially higher risk), Synovus engages an unafﬁ liated appraiser to 
reappraise the value of the collateral on a more frequent basis. Examples 
of circumstances that could warrant a new appraisal on an existing 
performing credit include instances in which local market conditions where 
the real estate collateral is located have deteriorated, the collateral has 
experienced damage (ﬁ re, wind damage, etc.), the lease or sell-out of 
the collateral has not met the original projections, and the net operating 
income of the collateral has declined. In circumstances where the collateral 
is no longer considered sufﬁ cient, Synovus seeks to obtain additional 
collateral. Examples of adjustments made quarterly to appraised values include broker’s commission, unpaid real estate taxes, attorney’s fees, 
other estimated costs to dispose of the property, known damage to the 
property, known declines in the net operating income of the property or 
rent rolls, as well as third-party market data.
Loan GuaranteesIn addition to collateral, Synovus generally requires a guarantee from all 
principals on all commercial real estate and commercial and industrial 
lending relationships. Speciﬁ cally, Synovus generally obtains unlimited 
guarantees from any entity (e.g., individual, corporation, or partnership) 
that owns or contrpercent or more of the borrowing entity. Limited 
guarantees on a pro rata basis are generally requirpercent 
or more owners.
Synovus evaluates the ﬁ nancial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation 
of the guarantor’s current ﬁ nancial statements, income tax returns for 
the two most recent years, as well as ﬁ nancial information regarding 
a guarantor’s business or related interests. In addition, to validate the 
support that a guarantor provides relating to a commercial real estate 
loan, Synovus analyzes both substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor has the necessary ownership interest and 
control over these assets to convert to cash, and the global cash ﬂ ow of 
the guarantor. For loans that are not considered impaired, the allowance 
for loan losses is determined based on the risk rating of each loan. The risk rating incorporates a number of factors, including guarantors. If a loan is impaired, with certain limited exceptions, a guarantee is not considered 
in determining the amount to be charged-off.
With certain limited exceptions, Synovus seeks performance under 
guarantees in the event of a borrower’s default. However, due to the recent 
economic conditions, and based on the fact that a majority of Synovus’ distressed credits are commercial real estate credits, Synovus’ success 
in recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited.
Unsecured Loans
2012, Synovus had unsecured loans totaling approximately 
million, which represents approximately 5% of total loans. This 
edit card loans and 
apprmillion in commercial loans to borrowers that are 
primarily in the manufacturing, insurance, ﬁ nancial services, utilities, and 
religious organization sectors.
Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for 
Loan LossesDespite credit standards, effective operation of internal controls, and a 
continuous loan review process, the inherent risk in the lending process 
results in periodic charge-offs. The provision for loan losses is the charge 
to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for 
loan losses. Through the provision for loan losses, Synovus maintains 
an allowance for losses on loans that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent within the loan portfolio. However, 
future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes 
in economic conditions, as well as changes in assumptions regarding 
a borrower’s ability to pay and/or collateral values. In addition, various 
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination procedures, 
periodically review Synovus Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Based on 
their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may require Synovus Bank to recognize 
additions to its allowance for loan losses.The allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus for accuracy and consistency between the changes 
in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in 
the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on an analysis which assesses the inherent risk for probable losses within 
the loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant judgments and estimates are necessary in 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Signiﬁ cant judgments 
include, among others, loan risk ratings and classiﬁ cations, the determination 
and measurement of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the 
probability of loan defaults, the net loss exposure in event of loan defaults, 
qualitative loss factors, management’s plans, if any, for disposition of 
certain loans as well as other qualitative considerations.7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
– Credit Quality” of this Report for 
further information.Non-performing Assets and Past Due LoansNon-performing assets consist of loans classiﬁ ed as non-accrual, impaired 
loans held for sale and real estate acquired through foreclosure. Synovus’ 
management continuously monitors non-performing and past due loans to prevent further deterioration regarding the condition of these loans. In 
order to reduce non-performing asset levels, Synovus has aggressively 
disposed of non-performing assets over the last three years. While 
Synovus still has an elevated level of non-performing assets, Synovus’ 2012 were at their lowest 
level in the last two years.7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Investment ActivitiesOur investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities classiﬁ ed as available for sale. Investment securities available for sale 
provide Synovus with a source of liquidity and a relatively stable source 
of income. The investment securities portfolio also provides management 
with a tool to balance the interest rate risk of its loan and deposit portfolios.
Our investment strategy focuses on the use of the investment securities portfolio to generate interest income and to assist in the management 
of interest rate risk. Synovus also utilizes a signiﬁ cant portion of its 
investment portfolio to secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring 
2012, apprbillion 
of these investment securities were pledged as required collateral for 
certain deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and 
payment network arrangements. As such, the investment securities are 
primarily GSE debentures and mortgage-backed securities issued by 
GSEs, all of which have a high degree of liquidity and limited credit risk. 
A mortgage-backed security depends on the underlying pool of mortgage loans to provide a cash ﬂ ow pass-through of principal and interest. At 
2012, all of the collateralized mortgage obligations and 
mortgage-backed pass-through securities held by Synovus were issued 
or backed by federal agencies.Synovus also holds state and municipal securities and limited equity 
securities.Funding ActivitiesLiquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources 
of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers, and creditors, to 
support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus and 
its subsidiary, Synovus Bank, at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and 
without adverse consequences. Deposits represent the largest source of 
funds for lending and investing activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities from our loan and investment portfolios also 
provide a stable source of funds. Additional funding sources which provide 
liquidity include FHLB advances, brokered deposits and other short-term 
borrowed funds, as well as through equity and debt issued through the 
capital markets, including our recent public offerings. Synovus’ ALCO, 
operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by the Board of 
Directors, actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash ﬂ ows in 
order to properly manage Synovus’ liquidity position. Following is a brief 
description of the various sources of funds used by Synovus. For further

DepositsDeposits provide the most signiﬁ cant funding source for Synovus’ interest 
earning assets and remain a strength of Synovus’ business. Deposits are 
attracted principally from clients within Synovus’ retail branch network 
through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals 
and businesses, including non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, 
interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, money 
market deposit accounts, and time deposit accounts. Synovus also utilizes 
brokered deposits as a funding source in addition to deposits attracted 
through its retail branch network. Terms vary among deposit products with 
respect to commitment periods, minimum balances, and applicable fees. 
Interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of Synovus’ 
interest expense. Interest rates offered on interest-bearing deposits are 
determined based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, interest rates offercurrent and 
anticipated future interthe 
the availability 
and cost of alternative funding sources. Client deposits are attractive 
sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. Deposits 
are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and 
provide opportunities to cross-sell other Synovus services.

– Deposits” of this Report for further 
information.Borrowed Funds and Non-Deposit Liquidity
Synovus’ ability to borrow funds from non-deposit sources provides 
additional ﬂ exibility in meeting the liquidity needs of Synovus. Synovus 
generates non-deposit liquidity through maturities and repayments of loans 
by customers and access to sources of funds other than deposits. Synovus 
Bank has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the 
2012, Synovus Bank had access to incremental 
funding, subject to available collateral and FHLB credit policies, through 

utilization of FHLB advances.In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs including 
capital infusions into subsidiaries, the servicing of debt, the payment 
of general corporate expenses, and the payment of dividends on our 
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock. The primary source of 
liquidity for Synovus has historically consisted of dividends from its 
subsidiaries, including Synovus Bank, which is governed by certain rules 
and regulations of the GA DBF and the FDIC. Dividends from Synovus 
Bank in 2010 wermillion. During 2011 and 2012 Synovus Bank 
did not pay dividends to the Parent Company. Synovus’ ability to receive 
dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number 
of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank’s future proﬁ ts, 
asset quality and overall condition.Synovus Bank is currently subject to an MOU that prohibits it from paying 
any cash dividends to Synovus without regulatory approval, and other GA 
DBF rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of 
– Supervision, Regulation 
Synovus expects that it will receive dividends from Synovus Bank during 
2013. If Synovus does not receive dividends from Synovus Bank during 

2013, Synovus’ liquidity could be adversely affected. In particular, failure 
to receive dividends from Synovus Bank will impair Synovus’ ability to 
repay TARP in full without issuing substantially more debt or equity than it 
otherwise anticipates will be required. Synovus has historically enjoyed a solid 
reputation in the capital markets and in the past few years has relied on the 
capital markets to provide needed liquidity resources, including its public 
of2012. 
Despite the success of these public offerings, there can be no assurance 
that Synovus would be able to obtain additional new borrowings or issue

Enterprise Risk ManagementAs a ﬁ nancial services organization, Synovus accepts a certain degree of 
risk with each business decision it makes. Risk management does not eliminate risk, but seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk 
and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. Understanding 
our risks and managing them appropriately can enhance our ability to 
make better decisions, deliver on objectives, and improve performance. 
A risk management framework has been established within Synovus, 
which begins with the Board of Directors, working primarily with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. The Risk Committee fulﬁ lls the overarching 
oversight role for the risk management process, including approval of risk 
tolerance levels and risk policies and limits, monitoring key and emerging risks and reviews risk assessments. The Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer reports to the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and provides overall vision, direction and leadership 
regarding our enterprise risk management framework.
The risk management framework includes an Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer that consists of all Synovus’ corporate 
executive ofﬁ cers and the Senior Director of Enterprise Risk. The committee 
meets regularly to monitor Synovus’ key and emerging risks and ensures 
that these risks are effectively managed and assesses capital relative to the 
Company’s risk appetite. Senior management risk committees oversee the 
various risk types within the Company as shown below and provide minutes 
of activities and decisions to the Board of Directors. These committees 
are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management 
in their respective areas of authority. The Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer is an active 
member of each of these management risk committees. •ALCO -Interest Rate/Market Risk and Liquidity Risk
 •Credit Risk
 • • •– Reputational Risk, Litigation Risk, and 
Strategic RiskManagement believes that Synovus’ primary risk exposures are credit, 
liquidity, operational, and regulatory compliance risk. Credit risk is risk 
of loss arising from our borrowers’ or counterparties’ inability to meet 
the ﬁ nancial terms of any contract with the Company, or other failure to 
perform as agreed. Liquidity risk arises from an inability of the Company to 
meet current or future obligations when they come due without incurring 
unacceptable losses. Operational risk arises from the potential that 
inadequate information systems, operational problems, inadequate or 
failed internal controls, human error, fraud or external events will result in 
unexpected losses. Compliance risk arises from nonconformance with 
laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the ﬁ nancial services industry 
and exposes the Company to monetary penalties, enforcement actions, 
or other sanctions.ALCOALCO monitors Synovus’ economic, competitive, and regulatory environment 
and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity 
and funding risk, interest rate risk, and market risk and has the authority 
to create policies relative to these risks. ALCO, operating under liquidity 
and funding policies approved by the Board of Directors, actively analyzes

The Company has established a credit risk management process with 
policies, controls and regular Board and management oversight. Credit 
risk management is guided by centralized credit policies that provide for 
a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of 
credits. The Credit Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, 
monitors credit management reports, establishes lending policies, limits, 
and guidance to better manage the loan function, and provides strategies 
to reduce the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio. The Credit Risk 
Committee oversees risk grade accuracy, credit servicing requirements, 
and loan concentration levels and manages risk in the execution of loan 
growth strategies.
The Regional Credit function reports to the Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, providing 
independence from the line of business. Regional Credit manages credit 
activities within each region, underwriting borrowing relationships over 
certain dollar thresholds, managing small business accounts, jointly 
approving loans over the banking division’s lending authority, and ensuring 
that loan administration processes for each banking division are sound 
and appropriate.
MAD was established in 2011 to better execute aggressive resolution 
strategies for problem credits through workouts, modiﬁ cations and asset 
dispositions, allowing lenders to focus on developing new relationships and 
expand existing relationships. MAD team members possess the specialized 
skill set to efﬁ ciently execute workouts and dispositions.
Synovus has established the ALL Oversight Council to review and approve 
the adequacy of the allowance and ALL methodology. The ALL Oversight 
Council includes the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer, Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, Chief Accounting Ofﬁ cer, the Senior Director of Enterprise Risk 
Management, and the Senior Director of Loan Review. The Council 
meets at least on a quarterly basis. The allowance adequacy and the 
ALL methodology are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors on at least a quarterly basis. The Model Risk Management 
department reviews the ALL methodology on an annual basis and prior 
to implementation of model changes.Synovus maintains a centralized Retail Lending Center, reporting to the 
Chief Community Banking Ofﬁ cer where Consumer loans are centrally 
processed, scored, and analyzed. This structure enhances the control 
environment, drives efﬁ ciencies, and provides a more consistent overall 
customer experience.Compliance RiskCompliance laws, rules and standards generally cover matters such as 
observing proper standards of market conduct, managing conﬂ icts of 
interest, treating customers fairly, and ensuring the suitability of customer 
advice. They also include basic prudential banking requirements and speciﬁ c 
areas such as the prevention of money laundering and terrorist ﬁ nancing.
The Regulatory Compliance Risk Committee was formed to assist the Board 
and management in overseeing the management of overall compliance risk, 
development and implementation of policy, and ensuring that compliance 
issues are resolved effectively and expeditiously. The Committee is made 
up of senior management from the business lines, risk management, legal, 
human resources, and compliance functions and speciﬁ cally provides 
oversight for the Corporate Compliance Policy and Programs, BSA/
AML Policy and Programs, new and modiﬁ ed products and services and 
compliance examination exceptions throughout the Company. Written 
policies contain the principles to be followed by management and staff 
of the banking divisions, subsidiaries and business lines throughout the 
Company and explain and direct the processes by which risks are identiﬁ ed 
and managed. The individual policies guide the Company’s compliance 
functions and provide for monitoring, training, and risk assessments.

Operational RiskSynovus aims to avoid and reduce unexpected loss through judicious risk 
management by instilling a proactive and structured approach to operational 
risk management. The Operational Risk Committee is responsible for 
providing oversight of the operational risk function to ensure there are 
effective processes to assess, monitor and mitigate operational risk. 
Additionally, the Operational Risk Committee is the approval vehicle for the 
ORM Framework. Speciﬁ c responsibilities include (1) providing a forum for 
addressing operational issues that require coordination and/or cooperation 
of multiple operational groups; (2) the identiﬁ cation and prioritization of 
operational risk initiatives; (3) the review of signiﬁ cant operational risk 
exposures and their conformance to Synovus’ stated operational risk 
objectives; (4) assembling ad hoc committees to address key areas of 
operational risk identiﬁ ed by the committee and (5) annually reviewing the 
risk metrics for ongoing pertinence to the risk management framework.Operational Risk Management is responsible for assessing systems 
and processes designed and implemented by management, promoting 
operating efﬁ ciency and encouraging compliance with laws, regulations 
and internal policies to ensure they are adequately designed, controlled 
and functioning effectively.
Business Units and Support Functions are accountable for ensuring that 
the Operational Risk Management Policy is properly communicated and 
understood within their respective organizational units. Business Units 
are also responsible for identifying and reporting operational risk trends 
that require resolution, participating in risk assessments, responding to 
changes in risk metrics and to implement corrective actions and new risk 
solutions (policies, technology, process change, personnel).
ORM has developed an array of program tools to assists business units 
in effectively managing operational risk. The program tools will ensure 
standardized implementation of the ORM Framework across the enterprise. 
ORM Program tools include Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Issue

Strategic RiskThe Strategic Risk Committee is charged with identifying key strategic risks which might threaten the strategic direction and/or long-term viability 
of Synovus, bringing those risks to the attention of the appropriate 
Synovus decision-making body, and ensuring Synovus puts in place 
activities designed to address those risks. This committee is made up of 
all members of executive management, who look beyond their functional areas of responsibility and take a holistic view of the organization and the 
environment in which it operates.
CompetitionThe ﬁ nancial services industry is highly competitive and could become 
more competitive as a result of recent and ongoing legislative, regulatory 
and technological changes, and continued consolidation and economic turmoil within the ﬁ nancial services industry. The ability of nonbanking 
ﬁ nancial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial 
banks also has intensiﬁ ed competition. Our bank subsidiary and wholly-
owned non-bank subsidiaries compete actively with national and state banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions and other nonbank 
ﬁ nancial institutions, including securities brokers and dealers, investment 
advisory ﬁ rms, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, 
ﬁ nance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies and certain 
governmental agencies, all of which actively engage in marketing various 
types of loans, deposit accounts and other ﬁ nancial services. These 
competitors have been successful in developing products that are in 
direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered 
by traditional banking institutions. Our ability to deliver strong ﬁ nancial 
performance will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of, and effectively deliver, products and services, which will allow us to meet 
the changing needs of our customers.2012, we were the second largest bank holding 
company headquartered in Georgia, based on assets. Customers for 
ﬁ nancial services are generally inﬂ uenced by convenience, quality of

Supervision, Regulation and Other FactorsLike all bank holding companies and ﬁ nancial holding companies, we are 
regulated extensively under federal and state law. In addition, Synovus 
Bank and certain of our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation 
under federal and state law. The following discussion sets forth some of 
the elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us and certain 
of our subsidiaries. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the 
protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the 
protection of security holders and creditors. To the extent that the following 
information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualiﬁ ed in its 
entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.
GeneralBank holding companies and ﬁ nancial holding companies are subject 
to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, the GA DBF regulates holding companies that own Georgia-charted banks 
under the bank holding company laws of the State of Georgia. Synovus Bank, which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, which we refer to as the FDIC, and by its state banking 
regulator, the GA DBF. Numerous other federal and state laws, as well as 
regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, the state banking 
regulator and the FDIC govern almost all aspects of the operations of 
Synovus Bank. Synovus Trust Company, a subsidiary of Synovus Bank 
that provides trust services, is organized as a national bank and thus is 
subject to regulation and supervision by the Ofﬁ ce of the Comptroller of 
the Currency. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise 
our non-bank subsidiaries including our brokerage, investment advisory, 
insurance agency and processing operations. These include, but are not 
limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, federal 
and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance 
and brokerage activities.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, which is discussed in greater detail 
below, established the CFPB, a new federal agency with broad authority 
to regulate the offering and provision of consumer ﬁ nancial products. 
Rulemaking authority for a range of consumer ﬁ nancial protection laws 
(such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and 
the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) transferred from the prudential 
r2011. The CFPB has the authority to 

supervise and examine depository institutions with morbillion 
in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority billion or less 
in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with 
those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate 
in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their 
primary regulators. The CFPB also has regulatory and examination authority 
over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer ﬁ nancial products. 
The Dodd-Frank Act identiﬁ es a number of covered nonbank ﬁ nancial 
institution, and also authorizes the CFPB to identify additional institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction.Permitted ActivitiesUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is 
generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of 
morpercent of the voting shares of, any company engaged in 
the following activities: •banking or managing or controlling banks;
 •furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and
 •any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely 
related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, 
including: –factoring accounts receivable;
 –making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related 
activities; –leasing personal or real property;
 –operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings 
association; –performing trust company functions; –providing ﬁ nancial and investment advisory activities;
 –conducting discount securities brokerage activities;
 –underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money 
market instruments; –providing speciﬁ ed management consulting and counseling activities;
 –performing selected data processing services and support services;
 –acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types 
of insurance in connection with credit transaction;
 –performing selected insurance underwriting activities; –providing certain community development activities (such as making 
investments in projects designed primarily to promote community 
welfare); and
 –issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment 
instruments.The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to order a bank holding 
company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate 
its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause 
to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity 
or control constitutes a serious risk to the ﬁ nancial safety, soundness or 
stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company may ﬁ le 
an election with the Federal Reserve Board to be treated as a ﬁ nancial 
holding company and engage in an expanded list of ﬁ nancial activities. The 
election must be accompanied by a certiﬁ cation that the company’s insured 
depository institution subsidiary is “well capitalized” and “well managed.” 
Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 rating of the bank 
holding company’s subsidiary bank(s) must be satisfactory or better. We 
have made such an election and are treated as a ﬁ nancial holding company. 
As such, we may engage in activities that are ﬁ nancial in nature or incidental 
or complementary to ﬁ nancial activities, including insurance underwriting, 
securities underwriting and dealing, and making merchant banking investments 
in commercial and ﬁ nancial companies. If our banking subsidiary ceases 
to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory 
standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place 
limitations on our ability to conduct these broader ﬁ nancial activities or, if the 
deﬁ ciencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary. In addition, 
if our banking subsidiary receives a rating of less than satisfactory under 
the Community Reinvestment Act, we would be prohibited from engaging 
in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding 
companies that are not ﬁ nancial holding companies. If, after becoming a 
ﬁ nancial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a 
bank holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the 
prerequisites for ﬁ nancial holding company status, including those described

Actions by Federal and State RegulatorsLike all bank and ﬁ nancial holding companies, we are regulated extensively 
under federal and state law. Under federal and state laws and regulations 
pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, 
state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC 
as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict 
certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufﬁ cient capital 
or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be 
deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, our bank regulators can require us to enter into informal or 
formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, MOUs, written 
agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which 
we would be required to take identiﬁ ed corrective actions to address cited 
concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.
During 2009, as a result of losses that we had incurred during the economic 
downturn and due to our high level of credit losses and non-performing 
assets incurred, we entered into an MOU with the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Atlanta and the Georgia Commissioner, pursuant to which we agreed 
to implement plans that are intended to, among other things, minimize 
credit losses and reduce the amount of our distressed assets, limit and 
manage our concentrations in commercial loans, improve our credit 
risk management and related policies and procedures, address liquidity 
management and current and future capital requirements, strengthen 
enterprise risk management practices, and provide for succession planning 
for key corporate and regional management positions and our board of 
directors. The MOU also requires that we inform and consult with the 
Federal Reserve Board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends, 
and obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and 
the Georgia Commissioner prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend 
on our Common Stock above $0.01 per share.
In addition, Synovus Bank is presently subject to an MOU with the Georgia 
Commissioner and the FDIC that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above. The Synovus Bank MOU also requires that Synovus Bank obtain 
approval from the Georgia Commissioner and the FDIC prior to paying 
any cash dividends to Synovus and provides that we update our long-
term strategic plan to reﬂ ect the Charter Consolidation and the various 
actions we have otherwise agreed to implement under the memorandum 
of understanding. Also, as a result of recent compliance exams, Synovus 
Bank entered into an informal written agreement with the FDIC relating 
to certain compliance matters. Under this agreement, Synovus Bank is 
required to implement written action plans, policies and procedures to 
address and remediate identiﬁ ed compliance concerns and furnish written 
quarterly progress reports to the FDIC.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory 
agreements, or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with 
the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory 
agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, 
heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent 
orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, 
including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our Common Stock 
and Series A Preferred Stock. If our regulators were to take such additional 
supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to signiﬁ cant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as 
well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required 
to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory 
action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, 
operating ﬂ exibility, ﬁ nancial condition, and the value of our Common Stock.

Standards for Safety and Soundness
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory 
agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial 
standards for all insured depository institutions rinternal

crinterest rate risk exposurasset quality. 
The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, 
and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and 
beneﬁ ts. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and 
Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness 
to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the 
safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems 
at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under 
the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any 
standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the 
bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness 
compliance plans.DividendsSynovus is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Under 
the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare

or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay

paying any dividends on our Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock 
could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice.The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review 
their dividend policy and has in some cases discouraged payment unless 
both asset quality and capital are very strong. In addition, pursuant to the 
terms of the Synovus Bank MOU, Synovus Bank cannot pay any cash dividends without the approval of the FDIC and the Georgia Commissioner. 
Additionally, we are subject to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to 
pay dividends if there is an event of default under such contract.
The primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our 
shareholders are cash on hand and dividends from Synovus Bank and 
our non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions 
and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Synovus Bank and our 
non-banking subsidiaries may pay. Synovus Bank is a Georgia bank. Under 
the regulations of the GA DBF, a Georgia bank must have approval of the 
GA DBF to pay cash dividends if, at the time of such payment: •the ratio of Tpercent;

In addition, the Georgia Financial Institutions Code contains restrictions 
on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained 
earnings without the approval of the GA DBF.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act generally 
prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, 
including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. 
In addition, federal banking regulations applicable to us and our bank 
subsidiary require minimum levels of capital that limit the amounts available 
for payment of dividends. In addition, many regulators have a policy, 
but not a requirement, that a dividend payment should not exceed net 
income to date in the current year. Finally, the ability of banks and bank 
holding companies to pay dividends, and the contents of their respective 
dividend policies, could be impacted by a range of changes imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which will require implementing rules to 
become effective.

by the Federal Reserve Board and our bank subsidiary must comply with

holding company, we and Synovus Bank are required to maintain capital 
levels required for a well capitalized institution, as deﬁ ned in “Prompt 
Corrective Action” below.
Our Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve Board adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses 
the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding 
company or ﬁ nancial holding company and in analyzing applications to it 
under the Bank Holding Company Act. These guidelines include quantitative 
measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet 
items and that deﬁ ne and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. 
All bank holding companies are required to maintain T1 Capital of at 
percent of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items, Total 
Capital (the sum of T1 Capital and Tpercent 
of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items and T1 Capital of 
cent of adjusted quarterly average assets.
T1 Capital consists principally of shareholders’ equity less any amounts 
of disallowed deferred tax assets, goodwill, other intangible assets, 
non-ﬁ nancial equity investments, and other items that are required to be 
deducted by the Federal Reserve Board. T2 Capital consists principally 
of perpetual and trust preferred stock that is not eligible to be included as 
T1 Capital, term subordinated debt, intermediate-term preferred stock 
and, subject to limitations, general allowances for loan and lease losses. Assets are adjusted under the risk-based guidelines to take into account 
different risk characteristics. Average assets for this purpose do not include 
disallowed deferred tax assets, goodwill and any other intangible assets 
and investments that the Federal Reserve Board determines should be 
deducted from T

as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate, international regulatory

In addition, reﬂ ecting the importance that regulators place on managing 
2011, the banking agencies also issued 
proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more 
billion in total consolidated assets. This guidance which was 
ﬁ 2012, outlines four “high-level” principles for stress 
testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization’s stress-
testing framework. Speciﬁ cally, the guidance calls for the framework to (1) 
include activities and exercises that are tailored to and sufﬁ ciently capture 
the banking organization’s exposures, activities and risks; (2) employ 
multiple conceptually sound stress testing activities and approaches; (3) be 
forward-looking and ﬂ exible; and (4) be clear, actionable, well-supported, 
and used in the decision-making process. Moreover, the federal bank 
regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable 
to “large banks.” While many of these do not currently apply us due to our 
asset size, these issuances could impact industry capital standards and 
practices in many, potentially unfor2012, 
our T1 common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity 
and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed 
requirements. Regardless, complying with these new capital requirements 
will likely affect our operations, and the extent to which we will be affected 
will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the 
underlying details of these new requirements. These new requirements 
have been endorsed by the U.S. banking regulators, but have not yet 
been translated by the regulators into ofﬁ cial, ﬁ nal regulations for U.S. 
ﬁ It is anticipated that the regulators will adopt new 
regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS, 
and, as noted above, it was anticipated that the new requirements would 
be phased-in for U.S. ﬁ nancial institutions beginning in 2013. However, on 
2012, U.S. regulators announced that the implementation 
III would be delayed and regulators have 
not provided a speciﬁ c timeframe for their implementation of these 
requirements. It is widely anticipated that the capital requirements for 
most bank and ﬁ nancial holding companies, as well as for most insured 
depository institutions, will increase, although the nature and amounts of 
the increase have not yet been speciﬁ ed.
We are also subject to new “stress testing” requirements that are designed 
to require banking organizations to assess the potential impact of different 
scenarios on their earnings, losses, and capital over a set time period, with 
consideration given to certain relevant factors, including the organization’s 
condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. Speciﬁ cally, on 
2012, regulators issued ﬁ nal rules implementing provisions 
of the Dodd-Frank Act that require banking organizations with total 
consolidated assets of morbillion 
to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report the results to their 
primary federal regulator and the Federal Reserve Board, and publish a 
summary of the results. Among other things, these rules deﬁ ne the term 
“stress test,” establish stress test methodologies, set forth the form of 
the report that must be submitted, and require publication of a summary 
of results. Under the rules, stress tests must be conducted using certain 
scenarios (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), which the Board will

billion in assets to conduct its ﬁ rst 
stress test using ﬁ 2013 and, 
to report the results by Mar2014. In addition, the rules will require 
such organizations to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress 
test results (i.e., results under the “severely adverse” scenario) in 2015 
with respect to the stress test conducted in the fall of 2014.

To be well-capitalized, Synovus Bank must generally maintain a Total 
Capital (the sum of T1 Capital and Tpercent or 
greater, a Tpercent or greater, and a leverage ratio 
percent or greater. For the purposes of these tests, T1 Capital 
consists principally of shareholder’s equity less any amounts of disallowed 
deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles. T2 
Capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, certain types of debt 
and the eligible portion of the allowance for loan losses.In measuring the adequacy of capital, assets are weighted for risk at rates 
that generally range from zero perpercent. Certain assets, 
such as most cash instruments and U.S. Treasury securities, have a zero 
risk weighting. Others, such as certain commercial and consumer loans, 
percent risk weighting. Risk weightings are also assigned 
for off-balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments. The 
various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk-weighting to determine 
risk-adjusted assets for the capital calculations. For the leverage ratio 
mentioned above, assets are not risk-weighted.

on the basis of ﬁ ve capital categories as described below. The federal 
banking regulators are also required to take mandatory supervisory actions 
and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to 
insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, 
the severity of which will depend upon the capital category in which the 
insured depository institution is assigned. Generally, subject to a narrow 
exception, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act 
requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an 
insured depository institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal 
banking agencies have speciﬁ ed by regulation the relevant capital level for 
each category. Under the regulations, all insured depository institutions 
are assigned to one of the following capital categories:

minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized

institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal 
Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may 
not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject 
to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 

for regulatory approval. A depository institution’s holding company must 
guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to 
cent of the depository institution’s assets at the time it 
becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deﬁ ciency when 
the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the 
plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring 
the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit 
an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is signiﬁ cantly undercapitalized.
Signiﬁ cantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a 
number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufﬁ cient 
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce 
total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent 
banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to 
appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Deposit Insurance and AssessmentsDeposits at our bank are insured by the DIF as administered by the

base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the 
insured depository institution during the assessment period, minus the sum 
of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during 
the assessment period and an amount the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk-based assessment 
system found in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.of 2010, the FDIC adopted a ﬁ nal rule setting the DRR at

Dodd-Frank Act; Future Changes to Legal 
Framework2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which 
has and will continue to substantially change the regulatory framework under 
which we operate. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a signiﬁ cant overhaul of 
many aspects of the regulation of the ﬁ nancial-services industry, addressing, 
among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance 
assessments, consumer ﬁ nancial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, 
lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors 
and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Among the provisions 
that may affect the operations of Synovus or Synovus Bank are the following:
 •Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and 
enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.
 •New limitations on federal preemption.
 •New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and 
nonbank ﬁ nancial company to engage in proprietary trading and have 
certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.
 •Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to 
leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components 
of permissible tiered capital.
 •Requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized 
and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for ﬁ nancial 
holding companies. •Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.
 •Permanently raising the FDIC’s standard maximum insurance amount 
to $250,000. •Repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, 
ef2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay 
interest on business transaction and other accounts.
 •Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk by taking 
covered ﬁ nancial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that 
may lead to material losses. •Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage 
of the credit risk underlying the securities.
 •Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements 
of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them 
with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness.
Some of these and other major changes, such as the expiration of the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand transaction 
accounts, which occurr2012, could materially 
impact the proﬁ tability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the 
collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices 
or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, 
taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these 
provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while 
others are subject to further study, rule-making, and the discretion of 
regulatory bodies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions 
(known as the “Volcker Rule”) that are intended to restrict the ability of a 
bank to engage in proprietary trading that is viewed as risking the ﬁ nancial 
stability of the institution. “Proprietary trading” is deﬁ ned in the Dodd-Frank 
Act to mean engaging as a principal for the trading account of a banking organization or supervised nonbank ﬁ nancial company in any transaction 
to purchase or sell, or otherwise acquire or dispose of: (1) any security; (2) 
any derivative; (3) any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery; 
(4) any option on any such security, derivative, or contract; or (5) any other 
security or ﬁ nancial instrument that the federal regulators may determine 
by regulation. A proposal to implement these restrictions was issued in 
2011; however, the statutory deadline for issuing the ﬁ nal rule has passed. 
It is anticipated that a ﬁ nal version of these rules will be issued in 2013.
In light of these signiﬁ cant changes and the discretion afforded to federal 
regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the 
Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on Synovus’ 
businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional 
regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely 
affect Synovus’ business, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations. See

frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood, 
timing, and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty.
Consumer Protection Regulations
Retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations 
designed to protect consumers, which are enforced at the federal level 
by the CFPB. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by 
banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest 
rates. Loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit 
transactions, such as: •the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z , governing disclosures 
of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
 •the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring ﬁ nancial 
institutions to provide information to enable the public and public ofﬁ cials 
to determine whether a ﬁ nancial institution is fulﬁ lling its obligation to 
help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; •the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors 
in extending credit;
 •the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the use and 
provision of information to consumer reporting agencies;
 •the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer 
debts may be collected by collection agencies; and •the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility 
of implementing such federal laws.SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
22PAR 
Deposit operations also are subject to:
 •the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure 
of deposit terms to consumers; •Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to 
consumers; •the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the 
conﬁ dentiality of consumer ﬁ nancial records and prescribes procedures 
for complying with administrative subpoenas of ﬁ nancial records; and
 •the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs 
automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and 
customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller 
machines and other electronic banking services, which the CFPB is 
in the process of expanding to include a new compliance regime that 
will govern electronic transfers initiated by consumers in the U.S. to 
recipients in foreign countries.
Rulemaking authority for these and other consumer ﬁ nancial protection laws 
transferred from the prudential r2011. It 
is anticipated that many of the foregoing consumer laws and regulations 
will change as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other developments.
For example, the CFPB recently issued rules that are likely to impact our 
residential mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market 
generally, including rules that implement the “ability-to-repay” requirement 
and provide protection from liability for “qualiﬁ ed mortgages,” as required 
by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability-to-repay rule, which will take effect 
2014, requires lenders to consider, among other things, 
income, employment status, assets, employment, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance 
“safe harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualiﬁ ed mortgages.” The rules 
deﬁ ne a “qualiﬁ ed mortgage” to have certain speciﬁ ed characteristics, and 
generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, 
balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualiﬁ ed 
mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for 
qualiﬁ ed mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based 
on the highest payment that will apply in the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years of the loan and 
that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or 
percent. While “qualiﬁ ed mortgages” will generally be afforded 
safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance will attach to 
mortgages that also meet the deﬁ nition of a “higher priced mortgage” (which 
are generally subprime loans). As the deﬁ nition of “qualiﬁ ed mortgage” 
provides either a safe harbor or a rebuttable presumption of compliance 
with the ability-to-repay requirement, the deﬁ nition is expected to establish 
the parameters for the majority of consumer mortgage lending in the U.S.Reﬂ ecting the CFPB’s focus on the residential mortgage lending market, 
the CFPB also recently issued rules to implement requirements of the 
Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with 
respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualiﬁ cations) 
and has proposed, but not ﬁ nalized, integrated mortgage disclosure rules 
that will replace and combine certain existing requirements under the Truth 
in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
In addition, there are a number of signiﬁ cant consumer protection standards 
that apply to functional areas of operation (rather than applying only to 
loan or deposit pr2010, the Federal Reserve 
issued a ﬁ nal rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees 
and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. 
The Federal Reserve and FDIC also recently enacted consumer protection 
regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by 
ﬁ nancial institutions. The FDIC has also issued rules aimed at protecting 
consumer in connection with retail foreign exchange transactions. In recent 
years, the Federal Reserve and CFPB have made a number of changes to 
2009 amendment, 
which prohibits ﬁ nancial institutions, including Synovus Bank, from charging 
consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and 
one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts 
in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Regulation E 
amendments also require ﬁ nancial institutions to provide consumers with 
a notice that explains the ﬁ nancial institution’s overdraft services, including 
the fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices. The 
amendments to Regulation E became ef
2010, the FDIC supplemented the Regulation E amendments 
by requiring FDIC-supervised institutions, including Synovus Bank, to 
implement additional changes relating to automated overdraft payment 
pr2011. The most signiﬁ cant of these changes require 
ﬁ nancial institutions to monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive 
or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” 
follow-up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than 
six times during a rolling 12-month period. The additional guidance also 
imposes daily limits on overdraft charges, requires institutions to review 
and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account 
balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased 
board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs. 
The CFPB has also amended Regulation E to establish rules for a new category of consumer-initiated electronic transfers known as “remittance 
transfers,” which will require ﬁ nancial institutions to provide consumers 
that transfer funds to overseas recipients with detailed disclosures and 
to meet other requirements.
In addition, it is anticipated that the CFPB will engage in numerous other 
rulemakings in the near term that may impact our business, as the CFPB has 
indicated that, in addition to speciﬁ c statutory mandates, it is working on a 
wide range of initiatives to address issues in markets for consumer ﬁ nancial 
products and services. For example, the CFPB has recently requested 
comments regarding an effort to “streamline” consumer regulations. and 
has established a database to collect, track and make public consumer complaints, including complaints against individual ﬁ nancial institutions. 
We cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new, additional 
regulatory authority focused on consumer ﬁ nancial protection, or any 
new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may 
result from the establishment of this new authority, will have on Synovus’ 
businesses. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act 
may materially adversely affect Synovus’ business, ﬁ nancial condition or

Anti-Money Laundering; USA PATRIOT Act; 
Ofﬁ
 ce of Foreign Assets Control
Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that 
include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated 
compliance ofﬁ cer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing 
of the program by an independent audit function. We are prohibited from 
entering into speciﬁ ed ﬁ nancial transactions and account relationships and 
must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign 
ﬁ nancial institutions and foreign customers. We also must take reasonable 
steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard 
against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. 
Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access 
to ﬁ nancial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering 
obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA 
PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006.
The USA PATRIOT Act amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides 
for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and 
ﬁ nancial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money 
laundering. The statute also creates enhanced information collection 
tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: 
requiring standards for verifying customer identiﬁ cation at account 
omulgating rules to promote cooperation among ﬁ nancial 
institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties 
that may be involved in terrrequiring reports

23PAR 
by nonﬁ nancial trades and businesses ﬁ led with FinCEN for transactions 
mandating the ﬁ ling of suspicious activities 
reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and 
regulations. The statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements 
for ﬁ nancial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank 
accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation may send bank regulatory agencies 
lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. 
Our banks can be requested to search their records for any relationships or 
transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any 
identiﬁ ed relationships or transactions. Furthermore, OFAC, is responsible 
for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with 
certain prohibited parties, as deﬁ ned by various Executive Orders and Acts 
of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of 
persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons. If we ﬁ nd a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer 
that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze such account, ﬁ le a suspicious 
activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.

Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these 
anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in 
imposing “cease and desist” and other regulatory orders and money 
penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these 
requirements. In addition, FinCEN is in the process of establishing new 
regulations that would require ﬁ nancial institutions to obtain beneﬁ cial 
ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to establish 
ﬁ nal regulations on this topic.
Commitments to Synovus BankUnder the Federal Reserve Board’s policy, we are expected to serve as a 
source of ﬁ nancial strength to Synovus Bank and to commit resources to 
support Synovus Bank in circumstances when we might not do so absent 
such policy. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve 
Board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or 
relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary, other than a nonbank subsidiary 
of a bank, upon the Federal Reserve Board’s determination that such 
activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the ﬁ nancial soundness or 
stability of any depository institution subsidiary. Further, the Federal Reserve 
Board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself 
of any bank or non-bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution’s ﬁ nancial condition. In 
addition, any loans by us to Synovus Bank would be subordinate in right 
of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act codiﬁ ed the Federal Reserve’s “source of 
strength” doctrine; this statutory change became ef2011. 
In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act’s new 
provisions authorize the Federal Reserve to require a company that 
directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed 
both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its “source 
of strength” obligations and to enforce the company’s compliance with 
these obligations. As of the date of this Report, the Federal Reserve and 
other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing 
this requirement, though it is understood that regulators are engaged in 
a joint effort to produce these rules.
If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation 
process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a 
federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Synovus Bank 
would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, 
and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any 
insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred 
by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided 
by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. 
Synovus Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject 
to these requirements.
Transactions with Afﬁ
 liates and InsidersA variety of legal limitations restrict Synovus Bank from lending or otherwise 
supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with us or Synovus’ 
non-bank subsidiaries. Synovus Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W.23A 
places limits on the amount of “covered transactions,” which include loans 
or extensions of credit to, investments in or certain other transactions with, 
afﬁ liates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized 
by the securities or obligations of afﬁ liates. The aggregate of all covered 
percent of the bank’s capital and surplus for 
any one afﬁ percent for all afﬁ liates. Furthermore, within the 
foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered transactions must 
meet speciﬁ ed collateral requirements ranging frcent. 
Also, Synovus Bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality assets 
from any of its afﬁ 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadens 
the deﬁ nition of “covered transaction” to include derivative transactions 
and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a 
bank to have credit exposure to an afﬁ liate. The expanded deﬁ nition of 
“covered transaction” also includes the acceptance of debt obligations 
issued by an afﬁ liate as collateral for a bank’s loan or extension of credit to 
a third-party. Furthermore, reverse repurchase transactions will be viewed 
as extensions of credit (instead of asset purchases) and thus become 
subject to collateral requirements. While ﬁ nal amendments to Regulation 
W have not yet been adopted, the expanded deﬁ nitions took effect on 
23B, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging 
in certain transactions with afﬁ liates unless the transactions are on terms 
substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing 
at the time for comparable transactions with nonafﬁ liated companies. 
Except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that 
are deemed to be unsafe or unsound, Regulation W generally excludes 
afﬁ liated depository institutions from treatment as afﬁ liates. Transactions 
between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain 
ﬁ nancial activities may be subject to the afﬁ liated transaction limits. The 
Federal Reserve Board also may designate bank subsidiaries as afﬁ liates.
Banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit 
to executive ofﬁ cers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related 
interests. In general, such extensions of crmay not exceed certain 
must be made on substantially the same terms, 
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for 
comparable transactions with thirmust not involve more 
than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank’s board 
of directors.
Regulatory ExaminationsFederal and state banking agencies require us and our subsidiary bank 
to prepare annual reports on ﬁ nancial condition and to conduct an annual 
audit of ﬁ nancial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and 
procedures. Synovus Bank, and in some cases we and our nonbank 
afﬁ liates, must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate 
regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal 
and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting 
an examination has complete access to the books and records of the 
examined institution. The results of the examination are conﬁ dential. The 
cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate.

24PAR 
Community Reinvestment ActThe Community Reinvestment Act requires the FDIC to evaluate the 
record of Synovus Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, 
including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to 
open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could 
result in additional requirements and limitations on the bank.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate 
loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. 
The regulators have advised ﬁ nancial institutions of the risks posed by 
commercial real estate lending concentrations. Such loans generally include 
land development, construction loans and loans secured by multifamily 
property, and nonfarm, nonresidential real property where the primary 
source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the 
property. The guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners 
to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration 
risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:
 •total reported loans for construction, land development and other land 
reprcent or more of the institutions total capital, or
 •total commercial real estate loans reprpercent or more of the 
institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s 
commercial real estate loan portfolio has incrpercent or 
more during the prior 36 months.
2009, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance 
on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may impact our 
business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending 
and increasing the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk 
r941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, 
among other things, a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed 
securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. 
The banking agencies have jointly issued a proposed rule to implement 
these requirements but have yet to issue ﬁ nal rules.
BranchingThe Dodd-Frank Act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities. Formerly, under the 
Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efﬁ ciency Act of 1994, a 
bank’s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon 
whether the state “opted in” to 
de novo
 interstate branching. Many states 
did not “opt-in,” which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. 
The Dodd-Frank Act removed the “opt-in” concept and permits banks to 
engage in de novo branching outside of their home states, provided that 
the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch 
within that state. Accordingly, 
de novo interstate branching by Synovus Bank is subject to these new standards. All branching in which Synovus 
Bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence 
to applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Anti-Tying Restrictions
In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish 
any services or ﬁ x or vary the consideration for them on the condition that 
the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or 
services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries, 
the customer not obtain some other credit, property, or services from 
a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to 
assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer 
combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms 
if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. Also, certain 
foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule.
Privacy and Credit Reporting
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting 
and protecting conﬁ dential customer information. Customers generally 
may prevent ﬁ nancial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal ﬁ nancial 
information with nonafﬁ liated third parties, with some exceptions, such 
as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer. Financial 
institutions generally may not disclose certain consumer or account 
information to any nonafﬁ liated third-party for use in telemarketing, direct 
mail marketing or other marketing. Federal and state banking agencies 
have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and conﬁ dentiality 
of consumer information, and we are subject to such standards, as well 
as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in 

the event of a security breach.
Synovus Bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities. Use of 
such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation 
V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, 
and sharing of information between afﬁ liates and the use of credit data. 
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are 
not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act.
Enforcement Powers
Synovus Bank and its “institution-afﬁ liated parties,” including management, 
employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of 
the institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties 
for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. 
Violations can include failure to timely ﬁ le required reports, ﬁ ling false or 
misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may 
be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some ﬁ nancial institution crimes may include imprisonment for 20 years. 
Regulators have ﬂ exibility to commence enforcement actions against 
institutions and institution-afﬁ liated parties, and the FDIC has the authority 
to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease-
and-desist and similar orders may, among other things, require afﬁ rmative 
action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including 
restitution, reimbursement, indemniﬁ cations or guarantees against loss. 
A ﬁ nancial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose 
of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions 
determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking 
agencies also may remove a director or ofﬁ cer from an insured depository 
institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless.
We have entered into an MOU with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 
and the Georgia Commissioner pursuant to which we have implemented plans that are intended to, among other things, minimize credit losses 
and reduce the amount of our distressed assets, limit and manage our 
concentrations in commercial real estate loans, improve our credit risk 
management and related policies and procedures, address liquidity 
management and current and future capital requirements, strengthen 
enterprise risk management practices, and provide for succession planning 
for key corporate and regional management positions. Additionally, Synovus 
Bank is presently subject to an MOU with the Georgia Commissioner 
and the FDIC that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above and, 
as a result of recent compliance exams, Synovus Bank has entered into 
an informal written agreement with the FDIC relating to certain compliance

Monetary Policy and Economic Controls
The earnings of Synovus Bank, and therefore our earnings, are affected 
by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of 
the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve 
Board is to promote orderly economic growth by inﬂ uencing interest 
rates and the supply of money and credit. Among the methods that 
have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations 
in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate for bank 
borrowings, expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in 
reserve requirements against bank deposits. These methods are used in 
varying combinations to inﬂ uence overall growth and distribution of bank 
loans, investments and deposits, interest rates on loans and securities, 
and rates paid for deposits. Recently, in response to the ﬁ nancial crisis, 
the Federal Reserve Board has created several innovative programs to 
stabilize certain ﬁ nancial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit.
The effects of the various Federal Reserve Board policies on our future 
business and earnings cannot be predicted. We cannot predict the nature 
or extent of any effects that possible future governmental controls or 
legislation might have on our business and earnings.
Depositor Preference Statute
Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative 
expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository 
institution are afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation 
or other resolution of the institution by any receiver.
TARP Regulations
EESA and ARRAUnder the EESA, Congress has the ability to impose “after-the-fact” terms 
and conditions on participants in the CPP. As a participant in the CPP, we

restrictions on, and potential additional regulation of, ﬁ nancial institutions.
2009, under the authority granted to it under ARRA and 
EESA, the Treasury issued an interim ﬁ 111 of 
EESA, as amended by ARRA, regarding compensation and corporate 
governance restrictions that would be imposed on TARP recipients,

of our executives, consistent with regulations promulgated by the SEC. 
2010, the SEC adopted ﬁ nal regulations setting forth the 
parameters for such say-on pay proposals for public company TARP 
participants. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act contains separate requirements 
relating to compensation arrangements. Speciﬁ cally, the Act requires banking 
regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by 
providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at 
certain ﬁ billion or more in assets. A proposed

regulators have yet to issue ﬁ nal rules on the topic.
Additional regulations applicable to TARP recipients adopted as part of 
EESA, the Financial Stability Plan, ARRA, or other legislation may subject us to additional regulatory requirements. The impact of these additional 
requirements may put us at competitive disadvantage in comparison 
to ﬁ nancial institutions that have either repaid all TARP funds or never 
accepted TARP funds and may materially adversely affect our business 
and results of operations.
Capital Purchase Program
Treasury, or Treasury, announced that, 
pursuant to the EESA, it was implementing a voluntary program known 
as the “Capital Purchase Program”, or “CPP”, pursuant to which eligible 

ﬁ nancial institutions could raise capital by selling preferred stock directly

things, increase the ﬂ ow of ﬁ businesses and consumers 
economy, and was also intended to prevent additional 
failures of ﬁ nancial institutions. Synovus applied for the maximum investment

that this additional capital would be used to prstrength against

 Risk Factors
This section highlights the material risks that we currently face. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities.
The deterioration in the residential construction and development and land acquisition portfolio may lead to 
increased non-performing assets in our loan portfolio 
and increased provision for loan losses which could 
have a material adverse effect on our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.The residential construction and development and land acquisition real estate 
portfolio continues to experience a variety of difﬁ culties and challenging 
economic conditions, which continues to put pressure on our commercial 
real estate loan portfolio and has contributed to elevated non-performing 
assets in the residential construction and development and land acquisition 
portfolio. During the recent credit crisis, our residential construction and 
development and land acquisition portfolio experienced a higher level of 
NPLs and losses than any other loan category in our loan portfolio. From

7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
– Cr– Non-Performing Assets” in 
this Report. While recent economic data suggests that overall economic 
conditions are improving, if market conditions in the residential construction 
and development and land acquisition real estate markets remain poor or 
further deteriorate, they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our 
loans and real estate owned in these markets as we continue to reassess 
the fair value of our non-performing assets, the loss severities of loans in 
default, and the fair value of real estate owned. Furthermore, a sustained 
weak economy could result in a continuation of the decreased demand for 
residential housing, which, in turn, could adversely affect the development 
and construction efforts of residential real estate developers; adversely 
affect the ability of residential real estate developer borrowers to repay 
these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans; 
result in higher levels of non-performing loans in other categories, such as 
commercial and industrial loans, which may result in additional losses; and 
lead to an inability to grow quality loans in this loan portfolio, which may 
harm our future operating results. Management continually monitors market 
conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint for indications of 
change in other markets. If these economic conditions and market factors 
negatively and/or disproportionately affect some of our larger loans, then we 
could see a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and also be required 
to signiﬁ cantly increase our allowance for loan losses. Any further increase 
in our non-performing assets and related increases in our provision for 
loan losses could negatively affect our business and could have a material 
adverse effect on our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to 

cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially 

increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our 

capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established 
through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents 
management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been 
incurr7 
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and under – 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations” of this Report. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks 
inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of 
the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity 
and requires us to make signiﬁ cant estimates of current credit risks using 
existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, 
new information regarding existing loans, identiﬁ cation of additional 
problem loans, risk ratings, and other factors, both within and outside 
of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.
Because the risk rating of the loans is inherently subjective and subject to 
changes in the borrower’s credit risk proﬁ le, evolving local market conditions 
and other factors, it can be difﬁ cult for us to predict the effects that those 
factors will have on the classiﬁ cations assigned to the loan portfolio, and 
thus difﬁ cult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans 
through the classiﬁ cation process and effect on the level of the allowance 
for loan losses. Accordingly, we monitor our credit quality and our reserve 
requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other purposes.

In light of current market conditions, we regularly reassess the 
creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufﬁ ciency of our allowance for 
million or 1.91% of 
2012, comparmillion, or 2.67% 
2011. Future additions to the allowance 
may be necessary based on changes in economic assumptions as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower’s ability to pay and/or 
collateral values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral 
part of their examination procedures, periodically review the allowance. 
Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time 
of their examination, such agencies may require Synovus to recognize 
additions to the allowance or additional loan charge offs. An increase in 
the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in net income and 
capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, ﬁ nancial 
condition and results of operations.
We recorded a provision for loan losses for the year ended 
million comparmillion 
pr2011, both of 
which are signiﬁ cantly higher than historical levels. We also charged-off 
apprmillion in loans, net of recoveries, during the year 
2012, comparmillion in loans, net of 
r2011. While the provision 
for loan losses was lower in 2012 and 2011 than the provision for loan 
losses in 2010 and 2009, the provision for loan losses remains higher 
than historical levels.Even though our credit trends showed signiﬁ cant improvement during 
2011 and 2012 compared to the prior two years, our non-performing 
assets and credit costs remain elevated. While we expect that our levels 
of non-performing assets and credit costs will continue to decline during 
2013, we also expect that these levels of non-performing assets will 
remain at elevated levels compared to historical levels for the next two 
years due to the continuing weak economic conditions, particularly in the commercial and residential real estate sector, as the deterioration in the 
credit and real estate markets causes borrowers to default. Further, the 
value of the collateral underlying a given loan, and the realizable value 
of such collateral in a foreclosure sale, likely will be negatively affected 
by the sustained downturn in the real estate market, and therefore may 
result in an inability to realize a full recovery in the event that a borrower 
defaults on a loan. Any additional non-performing assets, loan charge-offs, 
increases in the provision for loan losses or any inability by us to realize 
the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default, could negatively affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition, and results of operations 
and the price of our securities.SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
28PAR 
We will realize additional future losses if our levels of 
non-performing assets increase and/or if we determine 
to sell certain non-performing assets and the proceeds 
we receive are lower than the carrying value of such 

assets.In 2009, we announced a strategy to aggressively dispose of distressed 
assets. During the four-year period fr2009 through 
2012, we disposed of apprbillion of distressed 
assets, including the sale of distressed assets with a total carrying value 
of apprmillion during 2012. As a part of our overall 
continued efforts to reduce distressed assets, we expect that we will 
continue our sales of distressed assets during 2013 and future periods. 
The actual volume of our future distressed asset sales, if any, will vary 
during any particular period, depending upon a variety of factors, including: 
an increase in the rate of migration of our loans from performing status 
to distressed status; an increase in the overall level of distressed loans at 
any given point in time; opportunities to sell such assets on a favorable basis; and further regulatory developments or directives to reduce our 
level of distressed assets.
We will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon 
dispositions of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such 
assets, which could adversely, affect our results of operations in future 
periods. Accordingly, we will realize an increased level of credit costs, and 
possibly losses, in any period during which we determine to dispose of an increased level of distressed assets. Further, the continuing weakness in 
the residential and commercial real estate markets may negatively impact 
our ability to dispose of distressed assets, and may result in higher credit 
losses on sales of distressed assets.
We may not realize the expected beneﬁ
 ts from our efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives, which will negatively impact our future proﬁ tability.
In the current competitive banking environment, Synovus must continue 
to reduce operating costs and implement strategies to grow its loan 
portfolio and increase non-interest income in order to realize sustained 
future proﬁ tability and to remain competitive with the other banks in the 
markets we serve. Since 2010, we have implemented a series of strategic efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives to address the challenges facing Synovus 
and deﬁ ned strategies for expense reduction, streamlining of processes 
and long-term growth initiatives. In 2011, through the execution of these 
initiatives, Synovus rmillion, or 10.5%, reduction in total 
non-intermillion or 11.7% reduction in core

or 3.5%, fr7. Management’s Discussion and

In 2011, through the execution of these initiatives, Synovus realized a 
million, or 10.5%, reduction in total non-interest expense, and a

total non-intermillion, or 9.7%, compared to 2011. 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
– Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of 
this Report for further information. Management has also identiﬁ ed new 
expense savings initiatives of apprmillion to be implemented 
during 2013.In addition to efﬁ ciency initiatives, management continues to identify 
and implement initiatives to grow our loan portfolio and our non-interest 
income, including investing in additional expertise, product offerings, 
and product quality in Synovus’ commercial and industrial lending group 
and developing new products and services to grow new fee income. 
However, there can be no assurance that Synovus will ultimately realize 
the anticipated beneﬁ ts of its expense reduction and growth strategies. In 
addition, Synovus is subject to various risks inherent in its business. These 
risks may cause the anticipated results from our growth strategies and 
cost-reduction initiatives to result in implementation charges beyond those 
currently contemplated or could result in some other unanticipated adverse 
impact. Furthermore, if we do not realize the anticipated cost-savings from 
our efﬁ ciency initiatives, we may need to take additional actions including 
branch closures and headcount reductions to achieve the desired cost-
savings. The implementation of these initiatives may also have unintended impacts on Synovus’ ability to attract and retain business and customers. 
Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the anticipated long-term beneﬁ ts 
from our efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives will be realized and if they are not 
we may not achieve our strategic and ﬁ nancial objectives.
If economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules 
are modiﬁ ed, we may be required to undertake additional 
strategic initiatives to improve our capital position.During 2009 and 2010, Synovus executed a number of strategic capital initiatives to bolster our capital position against credit deterioration and 
to provide additional capital as Synovus pursued its aggressive asset 
disposition strategy2012, Synovus’ T1 capital 
ratio was 13.24%, its T1 Common Equity Ratio was 8.72%, and 
Synovus and Synovus Bank were considered “well capitalized” under 
current regulatory standar– Supervision, 
– Prompt Corrective Action” of this Report 
for further information. This regulatory capital framework is expected to 
change in important respects as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and a 
separate, international rIII.” In 
particular, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates T1 capital treatment for most 
trust preferred securities after a three-year phase-in period that begins 
2013. Furthermor2010, BCBS ﬁ nalized new 
regulatory capital standarIII, which are aimed at capital 
reform; seek to further strengthen ﬁ nancial institutions’ capital positions 
by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held, along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress. At 
present, our T1 common equity is in excess of the minimum common 
equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly 
proposed requirements. Regardless, complying with these new capital 
requirements will likely affect our operations, and the extent to which we 
will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity 
is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements. These 
new requirements have been endorsed by the U.S. banking regulators, 
but have not yet been translated by the regulators into ofﬁ cial regulation 
for U.S. ﬁ It was anticipated that U.S. regulators would 
adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by 
the BCBS to be phased-in for U.S. ﬁ nancial institutions beginning in 2013. 
of 2012, U.S. banking regulators proposed new standards to 
implement these capital requirements. However2012, 
regulators announced that the implementation of these rules would be 
delayed and did not provide a speciﬁ c timeframe for their implementation. 
While the timing of these new capital requirements is uncertain, it is widely 
anticipated that the new capital requirements for most bank and ﬁ nancial 
holding companies, as well as for most insured depository institutions, 
will increase, although the nature and amounts of the increase have not 
yet been speciﬁ ed.
In addition, reﬂ ecting the importance that regulators place on managing 
2011, the banking agencies issued 
proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more 
billion in total consolidated assets. This guidance, which was 
ﬁ 2012, outlines four “high-level” principles for stress 
testing practices that should be a part of a banking organization’s stress-
testing framework. Speciﬁ cally, the guidance calls for the framework to (1) 
include activities and exercises that are tailored to and sufﬁ ciently capture 
the banking organization’s exposures, activities and risks; (2) employ 
multiple conceptually sound stress testing activities and approaches; (3) be 
forward-looking and ﬂ exible; and (4) be clear, actionable, well-supported, 
and used in the decision-making process. Moreover, the federal bank 
regulators have issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable 
to “large banks.” While many of these do not currently apply to us due to 
our asset size, these issuances could impact industry capital standards 
and practices in many, potentially unforeseeable ways.

29PAR 
We are also subject to new “stress testing” requirements that implement 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and that are designed to require banking 
organizations to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on their 
earnings, losses, and capital over a set time period, with consideration 
given to certain relevant factors, including the organization’s condition, 
risks, exposures, strategies, and activities. These rules require banking 
organizations with total consolidated assets of mor
billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests, report 
the results to their primary federal regulator and the Federal Reserve 
Board, and publish a summary of the results. Under the rules, stress tests 
must be conducted using certain scenarios that the Board will publish by 
15 of each year. These new rules require a banking organization 
billion in assets to conduct its ﬁ rst stress test 
using ﬁ 2013, and to report 
the results by Marc2014. In addition, the rules will require such 
organizations to begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress 
test results in 2015 with respect to the stress test conducted in the fall of 
2014. This public disclosure of these stress tests could result in reputational 
harm if our results are worse than those of our competitors.
Synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry 
capital standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, 
and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at 
both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with the Company’s repayment of TARP 
and strategies that may be required to meet the requirIII 
and other regulatory initiatives regarding capital. If economic conditions or 
other factors worsen to a materially greater degree than the assumptions 
underlying management’s current internal assessment of our capital 
position or if minimum regulatory capital requirements for us or Synovus 
Bank increase as the result of legislative changes or informal or formal 
regulatory directives, then we would be required to pursue one or more 
additional capital improvement strategies, including, among others, balance 
sheet optimization strategies, asset sales, and/or the sale of securities 
to one or more third parties. There can be no assurance that any such 
transactions will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that we would be able to realize the anticipated beneﬁ ts of such transactions. 
We also cannot predict the effect that these transactions would have on 
the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, if we issue additional equity securities in these transactions, including options, warrants, preferred 
stock or convertible securities, such newly issued securities could cause signiﬁ cant dilution to the holders of our Common Stock.
Our net interest income could be negatively affected by the lower level of short-term interest rates and a 
decrease in total loans.Net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that 
we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on 
interest-bearing liabilities, is a major component of our income. Our net interest 
income is our primary source of revenue from our operations. Interest rates 
during 2009 through 2012 have remained within the range of 0% to 0.25% 
as set by the Federal Reserve during 2008. A signiﬁ cant portion of our loans, 
including commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, 
bear interest at variable rates. In addition, in order to compete for deposits in our 
primary market areas, we may offer more attractive interest rates to depositors, 
or we may have to pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds.
Our total loans decr2012 
compar2011. A decrease in loans 
outstanding and lower realized yields on investment securities reduced 
our net intere2012 and 
could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods. 
This reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the 
high level of competition that we face in our primary market area. Any 
signiﬁ cant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our 
business and could have a material adverse impact on our capital, ﬁ nancial 
condition and results of operations.
Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to 
changes in the deposit market and credit market, or 
the way in which we are perceived in such markets, 
may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and 
ﬁ nancial results.We may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity, 
including the capital markets, brokered deposits and borrowings from the 
FHLB, which could adversely affect our overall liquidity. Liquidity represents 
the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding needed 
to meet the needs of our depositors, borrowers and creditors; to support 
asset growth, and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations 
of our subsidiary bank. In managing our consolidated balance sheet, 
we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us 
with sufﬁ cient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments 
and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash 
management needs of our customers. Sources of funding available to 
us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and 
funding management strategy, include borrowings from the FHLB and

for further information. We also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation 
in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short- or long-term borrowings or equity issuances. If, due to market 
disruptions, perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors, we are 
unable to access the capital markets in the future, our capital resources 
and liquidity may be adversely affected.
In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including from other 
ﬁ nancial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, directly impacts our 
costs in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore, can 
positively or negatively affect our ﬁ nancial results. A number of factors could 
make funding more difﬁ cult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, 
including, but not limited to, further reductions in our debt ratings, ﬁ nancial 
results and losses, changes within our organization, speciﬁ c events that 
adversely impact our reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, speciﬁ c 
events that adversely impact the ﬁ nancial services industry, counterparty 
availability, changes affecting our assets, the corporate and regulatory 
structure, interest rate ﬂ uctuations, general economic conditions and the 
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding 
transactions. Also, we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies, many of which are substantially larger, and have more capital 
and other resources than we do. In addition, as some of these competitors 
consolidate with other ﬁ nancial institutions, these advantages may increase. 
Competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds.
For Synovus Bank, the primary source of liquidity is the growth and 
retention of deposits. In the current competitive environment, customer 
conﬁ dence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits. In this 
regard, Synovus Bank’s asset quality could play a larger role in the stability 
of the deposit base. In the event asset quality declines signiﬁ cantly from 
its current level or is perceived to be less than that of our competitors, 
Synovus Bank’s ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished.
We must also maintain adequate liquidity at the Parent Company level 
for various operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of general corporate expenses, and the payment of dividends on our

in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without 
limitation, Synovus Bank’s future proﬁ ts, asset quality and overall ﬁ nancial 
condition. Synovus expects that it will receive dividends from Synovus 
Bank in 2013. If Synovus does not receive dividends from Synovus Bank in 
2013, its liquidity could be adversely affected. In particular, failure to receive 
dividends from Synovus Bank will impair Synovus’ ability to repay TARP 
in full without issuing substantially more debt or equity than it otherwise 
anticipates will be required. In addition to dividends from Synovus Bank, 
we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of 
liquidity, including the capital markets, but there is no assurance that we 
will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or at 
all. If our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is 
diminished or only available on unfavorable terms, then our overall liquidity 
and ﬁ nancial condition will be adversely affected.
Our status as a non-investment grade issuer and any further reductions in our credit rating could increase the 
cost of our funding from the capital markets and impact 
our liquidity.
During the past three years, our long-term debt has been downgraded 
to below investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard and 
Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. The ratings agencies regularly 
evaluate us and Synovus Bank, and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our ﬁ nancial strength as well 
as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the 
ﬁ nancial services industry generally. In light of the continuing difﬁ culties 
in the ﬁ nancial services industry and the housing and ﬁ nancial markets, 
there can be no assurance that we will not receive further reductions in 
our ratings, which could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon 
which we are able to obtain funding and the way in which we are perceived 
in the capital markets. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in 
our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under 
review for a downgrade, could affect the market value and liquidity of our 
outstanding public indebtedness and increase our borrowing costs. We 
cannot predict whether existing customer relationships or opportunities for 
future relationships could be further affected by customers who choose

ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our

things, on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital

able to generate sufﬁ cient cash ﬂ ows from operations, or obtain future

During 2009, Synovus established a valuation allowance for substantially all of its deferred tax assets, primarily due to the realization of signiﬁ cant 
losses, signiﬁ cant credit deterioration, and negative trending in asset quality 
and uncertainty regarding the amount of future taxable income that Synovus 
could forecast. Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded 
against deferred tax assets at each reporting period. The determination 
of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate 
is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all 
2012, Synovus was in 
a three-year cumulative loss position, which represents negative evidence. 
However, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence at 
2012, management concluded that it was more likely than 
million of the net deferred tax assets will be realized based 
upon future taxable income and therefore, rmillion of the 
2012. The valuation allowance of 
2012 is related to speciﬁ c state income tax 
credits and speciﬁ c state NOL carryforwards that have various expiration 
dates through the tax year 2018 and 2017, respectively and are expected 
to expire before they can be utilized.
2012, apprmillion of Synovus’ 
deferred tax assets were disallowed when calculating regulatory capital. 
Applicable banking regulations permit us to include these deferred tax 
assets, up to a maximum amount, when calculating Synovus’ regulatory 
capital to the extent these assets will be realized based on future projected 
earnings within one year of the report date.
The valuation allowance could ﬂ uctuate in future periods based on the 
assessment of the positive and negative evidence. Management’s conclusion 
2012 that it is more likely than not that the net deferred 
ealized is based upon management’s 
estimate of future taxable income. Management’s estimate of future 
taxable income is based on internal projections which consider historical 
performance, various internal estimates and assumptions, as well as 
certain external data, all of which management believes to be reasonable 
although inherently subject to signiﬁ cant judgment. If actual results differ 
signiﬁ cantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if 
caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the valuation allowance 
may need to be increased for some or all of Synovus’ deferred tax asset. 
Such an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could 
have a material adverse effect on our ﬁ nancial condition and results of

the cumulative amount of pre-change losses and certain post-change

2010, we adopted a Rights Plan, which was approved by our 
shar2011 at our 2011 annual meeting. The Rights Plan 
provides an economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in 
concert to become an owner, for relevant tax purposes, of 5% or more of 
our stock and is intended to protect our NOLs from the potential negative 
consequence of an ownership change as deﬁ 382 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. The Rights Plan will terminate in accordance 
2013. Our Board of Directors could determine 
to extend the term of the Rights Plan upon the expiration of its current 
term or adopt another Rights Plan, subject to subsequent ratiﬁ cation by 
our shareholders, if it determines that our substantial NOLs are at risk of 
382 or that such action otherwise is in the best 
interests of our shareholders.
While adoption of the Rights Plan should reduce the likelihood that future 
transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change, there can be 
no assurance that the Rights Plan will be effective to deter a stockholder 
from increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the Rights 
Plan or that an ownership change will not occur in the future, especially 
if the Rights Plan is not extended or a new Rights Plan is not adopted 
when the current Rights Plan terminates. Furthermore, our ability to enter 
into future transactions may be impaired if such transactions result in an 
382. If an “ownership 
382 were to occur, the value of our net operating 
losses and a portion of the net unrealized built-in losses will be impaired.
We presently are subject to, and in the future may 
become subject to, supervisory actions and enhanced 

regulation that could have a material negative effect on 
our business, reputation, operating ﬂ exibility, ﬁ
 nancial condition and the value of our Common Stock.Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and 
soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, 
the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank 
deposits, each has the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on 
our part if any of them determine that we have insufﬁ cient capital or are 
otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition to examinations for safety and soundness, Synovus and its subsidiaries also are subject to 
continuous examination by state and federal banking regulators, including 
the newly formed CFPB, for compliance with various laws and regulations, 
as well as consumer compliance initiatives. As a result of this regulatory 
oversight and examination process, our regulators can require us to enter 
into GA DBF informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board 
resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent 
or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we could be required to 
take identiﬁ ed corrective actions to address cited concerns, or to refrain 
from taking certain actions.
We entered into an MOU with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the 
GA DBF pursuant to which we have implemented plans that are intended 
to, among other things, minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of 
our distressed assets, limit and manage our concentrations in commercial 
real estate loans, improve our credit risk management and related policies 
and procedures, address liquidity management and current and future 
capital requirements, strengthen enterprise risk management practices, 
and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional 
management positions and our board of directors. The memorandum of 
understanding also requires that we inform and consult with the Federal 
Reserve Board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends, and 
obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the 

GA DBF prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend on our Common 

Stock above $0.01 per share.
Synovus Bank is also presently subject to an MOU with the GA DBF and 
the FDIC that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the Synovus 
MOU described above. The Synovus Bank MOU also requires that Synovus 
Bank obtain approval from the GA DBF and the FDIC prior to paying any 
cash dividends to Synovus. In addition, as a result of recent compliance 
exams, Synovus Bank entered into an informal written agreement with 
the FDIC relating to certain compliance matters. Under this agreement, 
Synovus Bank is required to implement written action plans, policies and 
procedures to address and remediate identiﬁ ed compliance concerns and 
furnish written quarterly progress reports to the FDIC.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory 
agreements, or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with 
the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory 
agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, 
heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent 
orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, 
including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our Common Stock 
and Series A Preferred Stock. If our regulators were to take such additional 
supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to signiﬁ cant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as 
well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required 
to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory

on the conditions to repay our TARP funds and appear to address these 
questions on a case-by-case basis. Management continues to analyze the 
sources of funds to repay TARP through a combination of existing cash and

” of this Report.We are subject to regulatory initiatives applicable to 
ﬁ nancial institutions in general and TARP recipients 
in particular that could adversely impact our ability to 
attract and retain key employees and pursue business 
opportunities and could put us at a competitive 
disadvantage compared to our competitors.Our ﬁ nancial success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly 
motivated, well-qualiﬁ ed personnel. We face signiﬁ cant competition in 
the recruitment of qualiﬁ ed employees from ﬁ nancial institutions and 
others. Until we repay the TARP funds, we are subject to additional, 
and possibly changing, regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding the 
compensation of certain executives and associates as established under TARP guidelines. The increased scrutiny and restrictions related to our 
compensation practices, as well as any negative public attention that we may receive by virtue of our outstanding TARP funds, may adversely impact 
our ability to recruit, retain and motivate key employees, which in turn may 
impact our ability to pursue business opportunities and could otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. See 
1. Business - Actions by Federal and State Regulators” and 
1. 
 Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors” of this Report 
for further information.In addition to the guidelines on incentive and senior ofﬁ cer compensation 
under TARP, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the implementation of a 
variety of corporate governance and compensation practices applicable 
to all public companies, including Synovus, which may impact certain of Synovus’ executive ofﬁ cers and employees. These provisions include, 
but are not limited to, requiring companies to “claw back” incentive 
compensation under certain circumstances, provide shareholders the 
opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation, to 
consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive 
compensation disclosure requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires 
banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive-
based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk 
taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material 
loss at certain ﬁ billion or more in assets. Such 
provisions with respect to compensation, in addition to other competitive 
pressures, may have an adverse effect on the ability of Synovus to attract 
and retain skilled personnel.
Further,2010, the Federal Reserve, the Ofﬁ ce of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, the Ofﬁ ce of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC jointly 
issued comprehensive ﬁ nal guidance designed to ensure that incentive 
compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent 
risks. This regulation signiﬁ cantly restricts the amount, form, and context 
in which we pay incentive compensation.These restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared 
to our competitors that have repaid all TARP funds before us, or who did 
not receive TARP funds, and with non-ﬁ nancial institutions in terms of 
attracting and retaining senior level employees. Furthermore, to the extent 
that our competitors repay their TARP funds before us, our reputation and 
the public perception of our ﬁ nancial condition may be negatively affected, 
which could adversely affect our stock price.
Regulation of the ﬁ nancial services industry continues 
to undergo major changes, and future legislation 
could increase our cost of doing business or harm our 
competitive position.Between 2009 and 2011, many emergency government programs enacted 
in 2008 in response to the ﬁ nancial crisis and the recession slowed or 
wound down, and global regulatory and legislative focus has generally 
moved to a second phase of broader reform and a restructuring of ﬁ nancial 
institution r2010, President Obama signed into law 
the Dodd-Frank Act, which has, and will continue to substantially change the 
legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. The Dodd-Frank 
Act represents a signiﬁ cant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of 
the ﬁ nancial-services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic 
risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer ﬁ nancial 
protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending 
practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank 
regulatory agencies. Among the provisions that may affect the operations 
of Synovus Bank or Synovus are the following:
 •Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and 
enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.
 •New limitations on federal preemption.
 •New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and 
nonbank ﬁ nancial company to engage in proprietary trading and have 
certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.
 •Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to 
leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components 
of permissible tiered capital.
 •Requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized 
and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for ﬁ nancial 
holding companies. •Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.
 •Permanently raising the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance 
amount to $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance. •Repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, 
ef2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay 
interest on business transaction and other accounts.
 •Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by 
covered ﬁ nancial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that 
may lead to material losses. •Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage 
of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities.
 •Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements 
of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them 
with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness.
Some of these and other major changes could materially impact the 
proﬁ tability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral 
available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force 
us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. For example, the 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to debit card interchange fees 
have reduced our fee income. We may not be able to fully replace the 
revenue lost by this limitation. As a result of the expiration of unlimited 
insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts 
2012, we may see a run-off in certain noninterest-
bearing demand deposits to the extent such deposits exceed the FDIC’s 
$250,000 per depositor maximum insurance coverage limit, which may adversely impact our liquidity. Many of these provisions became effective 
upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others are subject to further 
study, rulemaking, and the discretion of regulatory bodies. In light of these 
signiﬁ cant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we 
cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act 
or any implementing regulations will have on Synovus’ businesses or 
its ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations 
resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect Synovus’ 
business, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations.
Certain other reform proposals under consideration, including new proposed 
regulatory capital requirements prIII, could

The ﬁ nancial services market is undergoing rapid 
technological changes, and if we are unable to stay 
current with those changes, we will not be able to 
effectively compete.The ﬁ nancial services market, including banking services, is undergoing 
rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven 
products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our 
ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and 
to create additional efﬁ ciencies in our operations. We expect that we will 
need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological 
changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources 
to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more 
heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement 
new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing 
these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to 
effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, 
and our business, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations, may be 
adversely affected.
We are subject to a variety of operational risks, 

including reputational risk, legal risk, and regulatory 

and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by 
employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our 
business and results of operations.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational 
risk, legal and regulatory and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft 
by employees or outsiders, including unauthorized transactions by 
employees or operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors or 
those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications 
of this Report for further information. Negative public opinion can result 
from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including 
lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from 
actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in 
response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect 
our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by Synovus can result in 
negative public opinion about our other business. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to our access to 
unsecured wholesale borrowings.
Our business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and 
business customer data. If personal, non-public, conﬁ dential or proprietary 
information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or 
misused, we could suffer signiﬁ cant regulatory consequences, reputational 
damage and ﬁ nancial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for 
example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who 
are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, 
employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted 
or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. Furthermore, a cyber-
security breach could result in theft of such data.
Because the nature of the ﬁ nancial services business involves a high 
volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded 
before they are discovered and successfully rectiﬁ ed. Our necessary 
dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions 
and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that 
technical ﬂ aws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems 
will result in losses that are difﬁ cult to detect. We also may be subject to 
disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly 
or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical 
or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics 
or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to 
disruption of service to customers and to ﬁ nancial loss or liability. We are 
further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to 
fulﬁ ll their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of 
fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and 
to the risk that our (or our vendors’) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could 
result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business (for example, 
by requiring us to expend signiﬁ cant resources to correct the defect), as 
well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory 
intervention, which could adversely affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition 
or results of operations, perhaps materially.
Our information systems may experience an interruption or security breach, which could result in 
serious reputational harm to our business, disrupt our 
business and lead to signiﬁ cant costs and losses.Failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, 
or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including 
as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the 
disclosure or misuse of conﬁ dential or proprietary information, damage 
our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a large ﬁ nancial 
institution, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large 
number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public 
and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security 
have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue 
to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and 
breakdowns. Our business, ﬁ nancial, accounting, data processing systems 
or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or 
become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including 
events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there 
could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical 
or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local 
or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as 
described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans

affected by signiﬁ cant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure 
or operating systems that support our businesses and customers.SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.

Information security risks for large ﬁ nancial institutions such as Synovus have 
generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new 
technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies 
to conduct ﬁ nancial transactions, and the increased sophistication and 
activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other 
external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure 
processing, transmission and storage of conﬁ dential information in our 
computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products 
and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PC’s, 
and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although 
we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, 
our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers’ devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that 
could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, 
loss or destruction of Synovus’ or our customers’ conﬁ dential, proprietary 
and other information, or otherwise disrupt Synovus’ or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations. As cyber threats continue to 
evolve, we may be required to expend signiﬁ cant additional resources to 
continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate 
and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
Synovus is under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-
attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize 
internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most 
signiﬁ cant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive 
customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach 
and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts 
to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social 
security numbers, are less frequent but could present signiﬁ cant reputational, 
legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure 
to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and 
complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to 
continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and 
our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our 
customers. While we have not experienced any material losses relating 
to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we have 
been the subject of attempted hacking and cyber-attacks and there can 
be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. The 
occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result 
in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and the disruption of 
our operations, all of which could adversely affect our business, ﬁ nancial 
condition or results of operations.
We rely on other companies to provide key components 
of our business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as 
data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking 
interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While 
we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control 
their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those 
resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, 
failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and 
security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for 
any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our 
ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise 
conduct our business. Financial or operational difﬁ culties of a third party 
vendor could also hurt our operations if those difﬁ culties interfere with 
the vendor’s ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be 
sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from 
breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. 
Replacing these third party vendors could also create signiﬁ cant delay and 
expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable 
inherent risk to our business operations.
The costs and effects of litigation, investigations or 
similar matters involving us or other ﬁ nancial institutions 
or counterparties, or adverse facts and developments 
related thereto, could materially affect our business, 
operating results and ﬁ nancial condition.We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, 
inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those 
– Legal 
Proceedings” of this Report. Synovus cannot predict the outcome of these 
or any other legal matters. For those legal matters where Synovus is able 
to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, Synovus’ management 
currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is 
from zermillion. This estimated aggregate range is based upon 
information currently available to Synovus, and the actual losses could 
prove to be higher (or lower). As there are further developments in these 
legal matters, Synovus will reassess these matters and the estimated 
range of reasonably possible losses may change as a result of this 
assessment. In addition, in the future, we may need to record litigation 
reserves with respect to these matters. Further, regardless of how these 
matters proceed, it could divert our management’s attention and other 
resources away from our business.
Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and 
indemniﬁ cation rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and 
any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, 
may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in 
any litigation or investigation signiﬁ cantly exceed our insurance coverage, 
they could have a material adverse effect on our business, ﬁ nancial 
condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance 
covering the ﬁ nancial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able 
to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we 
be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms 
or at historic rates, if at all.We may be required to record goodwill impairment

Our customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits, which could affect our income and force us to 
rely on relatively more expensive sources of funding.We may experience an outﬂ ow of deposits because customers seek 
investments with higher yields, including by banking with on-line banks that offer higher rates than traditional banks, prefer to do business with 
our competitors, or decide not to use banks to complete their ﬁ nancial 
transactions. Technology and other changes now allow parties to complete 
ﬁ nancial transactions without banks. This outﬂ ow of deposits could result 
in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits. Furthermore, it could force us to 
rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to fund our

business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our 
net interest margin. We may also be forced, to rely more heavily on equity 
to fund our business, resulting in dilution of our existing shareholders.
Changes in the soundness of other ﬁ nancial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely 
affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other ﬁ nancial 
institutions. We have exposure to many different industries and 
counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with a variety of 
counterparties in the ﬁ nancial services industry. As a result, defaults by, 
or even rumors or concerns about, one or more ﬁ nancial institutions with 
which we do business, or the ﬁ nancial services industry, generally have led 
to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could do so in the future 
and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our 
counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when 
the collateral we hold cannot be sold at prices that are sufﬁ cient for us to 
recover the full amount of our exposure. Any such losses could materially 
and adversely affect our ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
Our stock price has been and is likely to be volatile, and 
the value of your investment may decline.The trading price of our Common Stock has been and is likely to be highly 
volatile and subject to wide ﬂ uctuations in price. The stock market in 
general, and the market for commercial banks and other ﬁ nancial services 
companies in particular, has experienced signiﬁ cant price and volume 
ﬂ uctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to 
the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and 
industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our Common 
Stock, regardless of our operating performance, and the value of your 
investment may decline.We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans 

or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of 

breaches of representations and warranties, borrower 

fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm 

our liquidity, results of operations and ﬁ
 nancial condition.Synovus Mortgage sells substantially all of the mortgage loans that it originates. 
While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements require 
Synovus Mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding 
the existence and sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud 
by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with 
obtaining the loan. If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these 
representations or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either 
repurchase the loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor 
fees or make the purchaser whole for any economic losses associated with 
the loan. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to 
address perceived deﬁ ciencies in the residential mortgage loan origination and 
underwriting process, in part by creating new documentation requirements 
and underwriting criteria and increasing the potential liability of Synovus and 
Synovus Mortgage to their customers if Synovus and Synovus Mortgage fail 
to take steps to ensure and document that each borrower has the capacity 
and the ability to repay their loans.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2012, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans. 
The total expense pertaining to losses from repurchases of mortgage 
loans previously sold, including amounts accrued in accordance with ASC 
million, for the years ended 
2011, and 2010, respectively. The total accrued liability 
related to mortgage repurmillion 
2012 and 2011, respectively. We cannot assure you 
that in the current environment, Synovus Mortgage will not be required to 
repurchase substantially greater amounts of such mortgage loans, or make 
related indemnity payments to the purchasers of our mortgage loans. If the 
level of repurchases or indemnity demands becomes signiﬁ cant or Synovus 
Mortgage is alleged to be in non-compliance with the regulations under 
the Dodd-Frank Act, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, 
recently issued “ability-to-repay” and “qualiﬁ ed 
mortgage” rules that may have a negative impact on our 

loan origination process and foreclosure proceedings, 

which could adversely affect our business, operating 

results and ﬁ nancial condition.The CFPB recently issued rules that are likely to impact our residential 
mortgage lending practices, and the residential mortgage market generally 
including rules that implement the “ability-to-repay” requirement and 
provide protection from liability for “qualiﬁ ed mortgages,” as required 
by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability-to-repay rule, which will take effect 
2014, requires lenders to consider, among other things, 
income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit 
history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe 
harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualiﬁ ed mortgages.” The rules 
deﬁ ne a “qualiﬁ ed mortgage” to have certain speciﬁ ed characteristics, 
and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only 
payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being 
qualiﬁ ed mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria 
for qualiﬁ ed mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated 
based on the highest payment that will apply in the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years of the 
loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less 
percent. While “qualiﬁ ed mortgages” will generally 
be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance 
will attach to mortgages that also meet the deﬁ nition of a “higher priced 

mortgage” (which are generally subprime loans).
Although the new “qualiﬁ ed mortgage” rules may provide better deﬁ nition 
and more certainty regarding regulatory requirements, the rules may also 
increase our compliance burden and reduce our lending ﬂ exibility and 
discretion, which could negatively impact our ability to originate new loans 
and the cost of originating new loans. Any loans that we make outside of the “qualiﬁ ed mortgage” criteria could expose us to an increased risk 
of liability and reduce or delay our ability to foreclose on the underlying 
property. Additionally, qualiﬁ ed “higher priced mortgages” only provide a 
rebuttable presumption of compliance and thus may be more susceptible to 
challenges from borrowers. It is difﬁ cult to predict how the CFPB’s “qualiﬁ ed 
mortgage” rules will impact us when they take effect, but any decreases in 
loan origination volume or increases in compliance and foreclosure costs 
could negatively affect our business, operating results and ﬁ nancial condition.

Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings and 
claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Additionally, in the 
ordinary course of business, Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to 
regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and 
investigations. In the wake of the ongoing ﬁ nancial credit crisis that began 
in 2007, Synovus, like many other ﬁ nancial institutions, has become the 
target of numerous legal actions and other proceedings asserting claims 
for damages and related relief for losses resulting from this crisis. These 
actions include claims and counterclaims asserted by individual borrowers 
related to their loans and allegations of violations of state and federal laws 
and regulations relating to banking practices, including several purported 
putative class action matters. In addition to actual damages if Synovus does not prevail in any asserted legal action, credit-related litigation could 
result in additional write-downs or charge-offs of assets, which would 
adversely affect Synovus’ results of operations during the period in which 
the write-down or charge-off occurred.
Based on our current knowledge and advice of counsel, management 
presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal matters 
will have a material adverse effect on Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial 
condition, operating results or cash ﬂ ows. However, it is possible that the

T– Capital Purchase Program” of this Report for further 
information.Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its 
Common Stock. Management closely monitors trends and developments 
in credit quality, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries, which 
are expected to be signiﬁ cantly lower than those received in previous 
years), ﬁ nancial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory 
requirements regarding the payment of dividends, all of which impact 
Synovus’ capital position, and will continue to periodically review dividend 
levels to determine if they are appropriate in light of these factors and the 
restrictions on payment of dividends described below.
Under the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment 
or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles 
of Incorporation, or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business, or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital 
requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends, if any, 
that we may pay.
Synovus’ ability to pay dividends is partially dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from Synovus Bank and its non-banking 
subsidiaries, which are restricted by various regulations administered by 
federal and state bank regulatory authorities. Synovus did not receive 
any dividends from Synovus Bank during 2012 and 2011 and received 
signiﬁ cantly less in dividends from subsidiaries during 2010 than in 
previous years. Synovus’ ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank 
in future periods will depend on a number of factors, including, without

 Management’s Discussion a 
nd Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive SummaryThe following ﬁ nancial review provides a discussion of Synovus’ ﬁ nancial condition, changes in ﬁ nancial condition, and resul
ts of operations as well as a summary of Synovus’ critical accounting policies. This section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated ﬁ 
nancial statements and accompanying notes.Economic OverviewSeveral key economic indicators were noted to have improved throughout 
States in 2012 and further improvement is expected in 2013, 
including unemployment, housing prices, consumer conﬁ dence, and 
consumer spending. Synovus expects the second half of 2013 to positively 
outpace the ﬁ rst half of 2013 for some or all of these metrics.
The unemployment rate is projected to improve at a slow pace. Businesses 
are likely to invest and hire more when the resolution to the ﬁ scal cliff and 
the length of the sequester is determined. The perceptions of an extended 
States recession are more diminished than in prior years; therefore, 
both national and international interest in investment in the southeastern 
States is expected to increase during 2013, leading to potential 
demand for workers. National unemployment rates have decreased over the 
past thr2010 
2012. 
Within the Synovus ﬁ ve state footprint, unemployment rates are higher 
2012, the unemployment 
rate was 8.6%, 8.0% and 8.4% in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, 
respectively.
One of the largest industries in Georgia, real estate, creates additional 
sensitivities to Synovus during movements in housing prices. The housing prices in Synovus’ markets are now considered to be more comparable 
with those throughout the country. Additionally, there has been a recent 
marked increase in the request for building permits, privately-owned 
housing starts, and privately-owned housing completions. Nevertheless, several markets within Synovus’ footprint continue to suffer from previous 
overbuilding and speculative building. These markets continue to be a focus of Synovus and we continue to work to reduce our exposure in 
those markets. Occupancy rates in income-producing properties continue 
to be lower than desired, and Synovus expects those vacancy rates to 
decline at a slow pace.Consumer reaction to the expiration of the payroll tax cuts and ﬁ scal cliff 
uncertainties was less negative than expected, as indicated by various consumer conﬁ dence indexes from early 2013. Consumers showed more 
conﬁ dence and optimism about the current business and labor markets, 
the conditions of the capital markets, and the short-term outlook for the economy. These sentiments are tempered by lower spending by consumers, 
even as the Federal Reserve maintains record low interest rates. Many 
banks have seen core deposits rise and lending demand decrease while 
States economy. The number of 
bank failures continued to decrbank failures in 
2012 compared to 92 in 2011. The number of failed banks in Synovus’ 
ﬁ ve state footprint declined from 41 in 2011 to 24 in 2012.
Overview of 2012 Financial Results2013, Synovus reported results of operations for the 
thr2012. Synovus reported 
net income available to common sharmillion, or $0.85 
per diluted common shar2012, as 
comparmillion, or $0.15 per common share, 
2011. The accompanying consolidated 
2012 reﬂ ects 
million reduction in the income tax beneﬁ t for the three and twelve 
2012, as compared to the previously 
reported rdingly, net income available 
to common shar2012 was 
e.
The 2012 results were impacted by an income tax beneﬁ million, 
million income tax beneﬁ t recognized 
upon the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The reversal 
of the valuation allowance also drove the $0.93 increase in tangible book 
value per common shar
Total credit costs continued to decline in 2012 and drove the improvement 
in the results for the year. Total credit costs (consisting primarily of provision 
for loan losses and foreclosed real estate expense) wermillion in 
million or 23.8% decline from 2011. The decline in credit 
costs is primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality trends 
during 2012 including reduced NPL inﬂ ows, net charge-offs, special 
mention, and substandard loans.

During 2012, Synovus completed sales of distressed assets with a total 
carrying value of apprmillion, compared to approximately 
million of distressed 
assets sold resulting in pre-tax charges of apprmillion in 
the fourth quarter of 2012, which primarily consisted of a bulk sale of 
distressed assets. The distressed asset sales in 2012 primarily drove the 
acceleration in credit quality impr2012. Non-

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and ﬁ nancial reporting policies of Synovus conform to 
GAAP and to general practices within the banking and ﬁ nancial services 
industries. Synovus has identiﬁ ed certain of its accounting policies as 
“critical accounting policies.” In determining which accounting policies are 
critical in nature, Synovus has identiﬁ ed the policies that require signiﬁ cant 
judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management’s practice to 
discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors’ Audit 
Committee, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies 
has a signiﬁ cant impact on Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
Synovus’ ﬁ nancial results could differ signiﬁ cantly if different judgments or 
estimates are applied in the application of these policies.
Allowance for Loan LossesSynovus’ notes to consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 1 and 7 contain a 
discussion of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses 
2012, comparmillion 
The allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus, including the Credit Risk Committee, for accuracy 
and consistency between the changes in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in the loan portfolio. The allowance 
for loan losses is determined based on an analysis, which assesses 
the inherent risk for probable loss within the loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant 
judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the 
allowance for loan losses. Signiﬁ cant judgments include, among others, 
loan risk ratings and classiﬁ cations, the determination and measurement 
of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan 
defaults, the net loss exposure in the event of loan defaults, qualitative 
loss factors, management’s plans, if any, for disposition of certain loans, 
as well as other qualitative considerations. In determining an adequate 
allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, 
estimates, and assessments, which are inherently subjective. The use 
of different estimates or assumptions could have a signiﬁ cant impact on 
the provision for loan losses, allowance for loan losses, non-performing 
loans, loan charge-offs, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations. See 
– 
Summary of Signiﬁ cant Accounting Policies” of this Report for an expanded 
discussion of Synovus’ methodologies, qualitative considerations, and 
key assumptions.Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance
ASC 740-30-25 provides accounting guidance for determining when 
a company is required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred 
tax assets. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, 
based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some 
portion of the asset may not be realized due to the inability to generate 
sufﬁ cient taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary 
to utilize the beneﬁ t of the deferred tax asset. In making this assessment, 
all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset 
are considered, including taxable income in prior carryback years, future 
reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and 
future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 
carryforwards. The predictability that future taxable income, exclusive 
of reversing temporary differences, will occur is the most subjective of 
these four sources. The presence of cumulative losses in recent years is 
considered negative evidence, making it difﬁ cult for a company to rely on 
future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 
carryforwards, as a reliable source of taxable income to realize a deferred tax 
asset. Judgment is a critical element in making this assessment. Changes 
in the valuation allowance that result from changes in circumstances that 
cause a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets 
in future years are recorded through income tax expense.
Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred 
tax assets at each reporting period. The determination of whether a 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to 
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.

considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all positive and 
2012, the Company is in a three-
year cumulative loss position, which represents negative evidence. 
However, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence 
2012, management concluded that it was more likely 
million of the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
based upon future taxable income and therefore, rmillion 
2012. The valuation allowance 
2012, is related to speciﬁ c state income 
tax credits and the beneﬁ t of speciﬁ c state NOL carryforwards that have 
various expiration dates through the tax year 2018 and are expected to 
expire before they can be utilized. The reversal of the valuation allowance 
resulted in an income tax beneﬁ million, or $0.88 per diluted 
common shar2012, and an increase 
in tangible book value per common share of $1.02.
The valuation allowance could ﬂ uctuate in future periods based on the 
assessment of the positive and negative evidence. Management’s conclusion 
2012 that it is more likely than not that the net deferred 
million will be realized is based upon management’s 
estimate of future taxable income. Management’s estimate of future 
taxable income is based on internal projections which consider historical 
performance, various internal estimates and assumptions, as well as 
certain external data all of which management believes to be reasonable 
although inherently subject to signiﬁ cant judgment. If actual results differ 
signiﬁ cantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, the valuation 
allowance may need to be increased for some or all of the Company’s 
deferred tax asset. Such an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation 
allowance could have a material adverse effect on our ﬁ nancial condition 
and results of operations.
Other Real EstateOther real estate consists of properties obtained through a foreclosure 
proceeding or through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. 
At foreclosure, ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the 
estimated cost to sell, which establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, ORE is evaluated quarterly and reported at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell, not to exceed the new cost basis, determined by review of current appraisals, as well as the review of comparable sales 
and other estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent 
sources, changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time 
of the latest appraisal received or previous re-evaluation performed, and 
anticipated sales values considering management’s plans for disposition. 
Signiﬁ cant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating 
the fair value of other real estate, and the period of time within which 
such estimates can be considered current is signiﬁ cantly shortened 
during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and 
other economic factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its distressed asset disposition strategy. As a result of the signiﬁ cant 
judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in 
different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales 
transactions could differ signiﬁ cantly from appraisals, comparable sales, 
and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate. 

Management reviews the fair value of other real estate each quarter and 

adjusts the values as appropriate.
Fair Value Measurements
Synovus reviews assets and liabilities that are either required or elected to 
be carried, reported, or disclosed at fair value; and determines the valuation 
of these instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value 
Measurements. Synovus assesses the fair value measurements of each 
instrument on a periodic basis, but no less than quarterly.
These fair value measur820, which 
provides a three-level framework for determining the appropriate fair value for 
a particular asset or liability. These levels require consideration of information,

items for potential impairment, or for disclosure purposes.
Assets and liabilities classiﬁ 3 in the fair value hierarchy are

Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestment Securities Available for Sale
The investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities classiﬁ ed as available for sale. Investment securities available for sale 
provide Synovus with a source of liquidity and a relatively stable source 
of income. The investment securities portfolio also provides management 
with a tool to balance the interest rate risk of its loan and deposit portfolios. 
See Ta13 for maturity and average yield information of the investment 
securities available for sale portfolio.The investment strategy focuses on the use of the investment securities portfolio to generate interest income and to assist in the management 
of interest rate risk. Synovus held the portfolio duration at a relatively 
constant level for most of 2012 while the average balance of the portfolio increased from the prior year. The average duration of Synovus’ investment 
2012 compared to 
2011. During the third quarter of 2011, Synovus 
implemented a repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. The 
primary purpose of this repositioning was to reduce prepayment risk in the 
mortgage-backed securities portfolio. This was accomplished by selling higher coupon, more prepayment sensitive mortgage-backed securities, 
and purchasing lower coupon mortgage-backed securities. In addition 
to these actions, Synovus sold selected short duration U.S. Treasury and 
corporate securities and reinvested the proceeds in moderate duration 
mortgage-backed securities.Synovus also utilizes a signiﬁ cant portion of its investment portfolio to 
secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization. At 
2012, apprbillion of these investment 
securities were pledged as required collateral for certain deposits, securities 
sold under repurchase agreements and payment network arrangements, as 
required by law and contractual agreements. The investment securities are

Mortgage BankingSynovus’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Mortgage, originates residential 
billion in 2012 
and 2011, respectively. Synovus Mortgage offers various types of ﬁ xed-rate and 
adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of purchasing, reﬁ nancing, or constructing 
residential properties. The originated loans are substantially all conforming 
mortgage loans for owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans 
that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth 
by government sponsored entities such as the Federal National Mortgage 
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. These loans 
are generally collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate properties and 
are made to borrowers in good credit standing. These loans are primarily to 
borrowers in Synovus’ geographic market footprint.
Repurchase Obligations for Mortgage Loans 
Originated for Sale and Foreclosure Practices
Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are 
sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without recourse, 
or continuing involvement. These sales are typically effected as non-recourse 
loan sales to GSEs and non-GSE purchasers. Each purchaser of Synovus’ 
mortgage loans has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans, and 
the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is 
generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans are sold 
without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus Mortgage to 
make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and 
sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or 
other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. 
If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these representations 
or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the 
loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the 

purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of the loan.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2012, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans.

Since 2010, ﬁ nancial institutions have experienced a dramatic increase

properties loans include construction loans to homebuilders, commercial 
mortgage loans to real estate investors, and residential development loans 
to developers and are almost always secured by the underlying property 
being ﬁ nanced by such loans. Construction and residential development 
loans are interest-only loans and typically carry maturities of three years 
or less, and 1-4 family rental properties carry maturities of three to ﬁ ve 
years, with amortization periods of up to ﬁ fteen to twenty years. Although 
housing and real estate markets in the ﬁ ve southeastern states within

worked to reduce its exposure (including its exposure in historically high 
loss markets such as Atlanta) to these types of loans.Total residential construction and development loans (consisting of 
1-4 family construction loans and residential development loans) were

loans are secured by land held for future development, typically in excess 
of one year. They have short-term maturities and are typically unamortized. 
These properties are substantially within the Synovus footprint and generally 
carry personal guarantees from the principals. They are underwritten based 
on the loan to value of the collateral and the capacity of the guarantor(s). This portfolio increased during the recession as land loans originally planned 
for development moved back into inventory for future development but

makes retail residential real estate lending decisions based upon a number 
of key credit risk determinants including FICO scores as well as bankruptcy 
predictor scores, loan-to-value, and debt-to-income ratios. Through its

limited to, established banking relationship history, signiﬁ cant cash on 
deposit, and/or compensating loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios. 2009, as Synovus has continued to tighten its retail residential 
real estate origination policy, no documentation or stated income loans are 
permitted to be made only on an exception basis and only if supplemented 
by the mitigating criteria previously noted. While Synovus does not currently 
offer speciﬁ c no documentation or stated income retail residential real estate 
loan products, loans with these characteristics could have been issued 
under the previous loan policy or as an exception under the current loan 
policy, primarily to individuals with existing banking relationships. Synovus

and does not believe that extending such loans has had a signiﬁ cant 
negative impact on the credit quality of the portfolio.

Synovus has reviewed the Interagency Supervisory Guidance on Allowance 
for Loan and Lease Losses Estimation Practices for Loans and Lines 
of Credit Secured by Junior Liens on 1-4 Family Residential Properties 
2012. The guidance states that institutions should 
ensure that during the ALL estimation process, sufﬁ cient information is 
gathered to adequately assess the probable loss incurred within junior lien 
portfolios, and when an institution does not own or service the associated 
senior lien loans, it should use reasonably available tools to determine 
the payment status of the senior lien loans. Apprmillion in 
junior liens were classiﬁ ed as loss during 2012 as a result of this guidance.
During the third quarter of 2012, the OCC issued accounting guidance 
on single family residential loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
that were not reafﬁ rmed by the borrower. The guidance requires these 
loans to be classiﬁ ed as TDRs, regardless of payment performance, and 
the shortfall in collateral value should be classiﬁ ed as loss. Based on this 
guidance, apprmillion in loans were classiﬁ ed as accruing 
TDRs in 2012. An analysis of the fair value of collateral on loans that were 
not reafﬁ rmed by the borrower determined that the current level of reserves 
carried on these loans was not signiﬁ cantly different from the collateral 
deﬁ ciencies. Loans that were less than 90 days past due were generally 
classiﬁ ed as accruing TDR’s, and loans 90 days or more past due were 
generally classiﬁ ed as non-accruing TDR’s.

While there is not a deﬁ ned timeline for their sale, these ORE properties

Annual Impairment Test
For our annual goodwill impairment test, a third party valuation was obtained 
on the investment advisory services reporting unit, which accounts for 
approximately 82% of the recorded goodwill. The fair value of this reporting 
unit was determined by equally weighting the income approach (50%) 
and market approach (50%) to assess goodwill for potential impairment 
oach utilized a discounted cash ﬂ ow 
method, which is based on the expected future cash ﬂ ows of the reporting 
unit. The market approach measures values based on what other market 
participants have paid for assets that can be considered reasonably similar 
to those being valued.The ﬁ rst step (Step 1) of impairment testing requires a comparison of 
each reporting unit’s fair value to the carrying amount to identify potential 
2012, we completed the most recent annual 
goodwill impairment evaluation. The result of the Step 1 process indicated 
that goodwill at the investment advisory services reporting unit was not

estimated carrying value; therefore no further testing was required. The 
estimated fair value of this reporting unit using a weighted approach 
(income and market apprmillion, which 
million, or 6%. The 

key assumptions that drove the fair value of this reporting unit under the 
income approach included projected revenue growth, projected EBITDA 
margin, projected growth in assets under management and assets under 
supervision, and the discount rate. The market approach determined the 
fair value of this reporting unit using comparisons of the reporting unit to 
publicly-traded companies with similar operations. Under this method, valuation multiples were: (1) derived from operating data of the selected 
guideline companies; (2) evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths 
and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline 
companies; and (3) applied to the operating data of the reporting unit to 

arrive at an indication of value.Step 1 of impairment testing was also completed for the trust services reporting unit. The Step 1 test concluded that the trust services reporting 
unit was not impaired, as the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit 
exceeded the respective carrying value; therefore, no further testing was 
required. The key assumptions that drove the estimate of fair value of this 
reporting unit were peer price to earnings multiples, tangible book value 
to earnings ratio, book value earnings multiple, and the related control 
premium. The fair value of this reporting unit was determined by equally 
weighting the income approach (50%) and market approach (50%) to 
2012. The excess 
2012 was 
oximately 110% of carrying value.
Interim Impairment Test
Synovus also obtained a third party valuation to perform an interim 
impairment test of the investment advisory services reporting unit as of 
2012. The interim test was performed due to the loss of 
certain assets under management, which resulted in lower than forecasted 
revenues. The results of the interim impairment test of the investment 
advisory services reporting unit indicated that goodwill at the investment 
advisory services reporting unit was not impaired, as the estimated fair 
value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value; therefore, 
no further testing was required. The estimated fair value in excess of the 

carrying value r
The interim evaluation included an update to all assumptions used in the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit, bringing the calculation current. 
The calculation reﬂ ected a higher discount rate under the income approach, 
combined with management’s revised forecast. Management revised its 

forecasted revenue growth, EBITDA margin, and growth in assets under 
management and assets under supervision to reﬂ ect current market 
conditions and changes in investment strategies among its clients and an estimate of the tax amortization beneﬁ t.
Changes in the aforementioned valuation assumptions, including a lower 
rate of revenue growth than expected and a lower than projected EBITDA 
margin improvement or a lower than expected tax amortization beneﬁ t, 
could have a negative effect on the fair value of this reporting unit, which 
in turn could result in an impairment charge to goodwill in future periods.

Visa Shares and Related Agreement
Synovus is a member of the Visa USA network and received shares of 
Visa Class B common stock in exchange for its membership interest 
in Visa USA in conjunction with the Visa IPO in 2009. Visa members 
have indemniﬁ cation obligations with respect to the Covered Litigation. 
Additionally, Visa Class B shares are subject to certain restrictions until 
the settlement of the Cover2012, the 
Covered Litigation had not been settled. Visa has established a litigation 
escrow to fund settlement of the Covered Litigation. The litigation escrow 
is funded by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of Class B shares.
Synovus has recorded a contingent liability representing the estimate of 
the Company’s exposure to the settlement of the Covered Litigation, via 
the Visa Derivative liability. A relatively high degree of subjectivity is used 
in estimating the fair value of the derivative liability. Management believes 
that the estimate of the fair value of the Visa Derivative liability is reasonable 
based on current information; however, future developments in the litigation 
could require potentially signiﬁ cant changes to the estimate.

loans and investment securities comparable to taxable loans and investment 
securities. The taxable-equivalent adjustment is based on a 35% federal 
income tax rate.T

NET INTEREST INCOME, TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT$857,223927,734990,557
Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is a signiﬁ cant 
component of revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of 
gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources, and investing 
those funds primarily in loans and investment securities. Synovus’ long-term 
objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest 
income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks.
Net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax-equivalent 
basis so that the income from assets exempt from federal income taxes is 
adjusted based on a statutory marginal federal tax rate of 35% in all years (see Tabove). The net interest margin is deﬁ ned as taxable-equivalent 
net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets and 
provides an indication of the efﬁ ciency of the earnings from balance sheet 
activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in the spread 
between interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs 
(spread rate), and by the percentage of interest earning assets funded by 
non-interest bearing funding sources.

or 7.6%, from 2011. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income

earning assets decrbillion, or 7.4%, primarily as a result of a

Net Interest Margin
The net interest margin was 3.50% for 2012, a decrease of 1 basis point 
from 2011. The yield on earning assets decreased 22 basis points to 
4.11% and the effective cost of funds decreased 21 basis points to 0.61%. 
The effective cost of funds includes non-interest bearing funding sources 
primarily consisting of demand deposits.The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan 
yields, yields on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. During 2012, loan yields decreased 29 basis 
points to 4.80%. The decrease in loan yields was due to a continued 
decline in market interest rates and the downward repricing of maturing 
ﬁ xed rate loans, partially offset by an improvement in the negative impact 
of non-performing loans. Yields on investment securities decreased by 
127 basis points due to continued declines in bond market yields and a signiﬁ cant increase in prepayment activity, which resulted in a higher 
level of purchased premium amortization. The year-over-year yield on 
investment securities was also negatively impacted by a repositioning of 
the portfolio completed during the third quarter of 2011. A key component 
of this repositioning was the sale of higher coupon, more payment sensitive 
MBS, and the purchase of lower coupon MBS. This action was deemed 
to be prudent in light of continued declines in rates and the expectation of 
a higher level of prepayment activity. While increasing the stability of cash 
ﬂ ows, the short-term impact of selling higher coupon MBS is negative 
to the overall portfolio yield. The yield on balances held at the Federal 
Reserve Bank remained unchanged at 0.25% while the average balance 
decrbillion in 2012. Reducing 
these low yielding balances positively impacts realized earning asset yields. 
Synovus expects to further modestly reduce the average balances held 
at the Federal Reserve Bank during 2013.The primary factors contributing to the 21 basis point decrease in the 
effective cost of funds during 2012 were a 38 basis point decrease in the 
cost of time deposits and a 30 basis point decrease in the cost of money 
market accounts. In addition to these factors, reduced utilization of brokered 
deposits and a continued deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction 
accounts favorably impacted the effective cost of funds. Average non-
interest bearing demand deposits, which incrmillion, or 
8.4%, for 2012, funded 22.5% of average total interest earning assets in 
2012 as compared to 19.2% during 2011.
The net interbasis points from 
2010. The yield on earning assets decrbasis points to 4.33% 
while the effective cost of funds decreased by 31 basis points to 0.82%.
During 2011, loan yields decreased 8 basis points to 5.09%, due primarily 
to a continued decline in market interest rates and the downward repricing 
of maturing ﬁ xed-rate loans, and partially offset by an improvement in the 
negative impact of non-performing loans. Average net loans decreased 
billion in 2011. Yields on investment securities 
decreased by 101 basis points primarily due to the continued declines in 
bond market yields and the reinvestment of cash ﬂ ows from older, higher 
yielding securities. The yield on investment securities was also negatively 
impacted by the repositioning of the portfolio during the third quarter of 
2011. The yield on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank remained 
unchanged at 0.25%, while the average balance held at the Federal Reserve 
Bank decr
The primary factors contributing to the 31 basis point decrease in the effective 
cost of funds were a 36 basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits 
and a 30 basis point decrease in the cost of money market accounts. 
Additional factors that contributed to the decrease in the effective cost 
of funds in 2011 include growth in non-interest bearing demand deposit 
accounts, reduced utilization of brokered time deposits, and a continued 
deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction accounts.

2012, total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, 
wermillion compar2011. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between the ﬁ nancial statement 
carrying amounts and their respective tax bases including operating losses 
and tax credit carryforwards. Net deferred tax assets (deferred tax assets 
net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance) are reported on the 
consolidated balance sheet as a component of total assets.Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred 
tax assets at each reporting period. The determination of whether a 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to 
considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all positive and 
2012, the Company is in a three-
year cumulative loss position, which represents negative evidence. 
However, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence 
2012, management concluded that it was more likely 
million of the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
based upon future taxable income and therefore, rmillion 
2012. The valuation allowance 
2012 is related to speciﬁ c state income 
tax credits and the beneﬁ t of speciﬁ c state NOL carryforwards that have 
various expiration dates through the tax year 2018 and are expected to 
expire before they can be utilized. The reversal of the valuation allowance 
resulted in an income tax beneﬁ million, or $0.88 per diluted 
common shar2012, and an increase 
in tangible book value per common share of $1.02.
The deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 after the achievement of operating results for the fourth 
quarter and full year of 2012 demonstrated the continuation of proﬁ table 
operating results, excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge of approximately 
million from the discretionary distressed assets sales completed 
during the fourth quarter of 2012, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of proﬁ table operating results. The fourth quarter of 2012 results also provided 
further validation of the positive credit quality trending improvements marking 
the twelfth consecutive quarter of such improvements. The pace of credit 
quality improvement accelerated during the fourth quarter of 2012 after the 
completion of the bulk sale of distr2012, 
Synovus Bank’s classiﬁ ed asset ratio as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital

2011. The consolidated 
classiﬁ ed asset ratio impr2012 from 
2011, 
respectively.
In addition, the achievement of operating results for the fourth quarter 
and full year of 2012 consistent with management’s forecast for these 
periods, excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge of approximately 
million from the discretionary sales of distressed assets in the 
fourth quarter 2012, provides further evidence of the Company’s ability 
to produce reliable forecasts, and strengthens the weight of the positive 
evidence that forecasted future taxable income will be sufﬁ cient to realize 
million net deferr2012. The 
positive evidence related to the forecasted future taxable income assists 
in overcoming the weight of the negative evidence related to the signiﬁ cant 
operating losses recognized as a result of the recent ﬁ nancial crisis and 
2012 
deferred tax asset is more likely than not realizable. Prior to the fourth 
quarter of 2012, the Company was unable to conclude that there was 
sufﬁ cient evidence to support that the deferred tax asset was more likely 
than not realizable and to support the reversal of the deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance.The Company is currently in a three-year cumulative loss position which 
is considered negative evidence. The three-year cumulative loss position 
was driven by signiﬁ cant credit losses experienced during the recent crisis. 
While there have been signiﬁ cant improvements in credit quality trending, 
problem loans remain at elevated levels.
2012 included the Company’s 
signiﬁ cantly improved credit risk proﬁ le and the continued improving trends 
in credit quality, continued proﬁ tability in recent quarters, credit risk policy 
enhancements which reduce exposure to credit risk through concentration 
limits by loan type, exposure limits to single borrowers, among others, 
record of long-term positive earnings prior to the recent economic downturn, 
the Company’s strong capital position, as well as sufﬁ cient amounts of 
estimated future taxable income, of the appropriate character, to support 
the rmillion of the Company’s net deferred tax asset at 
2012. Management’s conﬁ dence in the realization of projected 
future taxable income is based on an analysis of the Company’s risk proﬁ le 
and recent trends in ﬁ nancial performance, including credit quality trends. 
Based upon the 2012 level of income, excluding both the impact of the 
pre-tax charge of apprmillion from the fourth quarter sales of 
distressed assets and the pre-tax 2012 net gain on the sales of securities, 
the Company would rmillion in net deferred tax assets 
in 14 years, which is well within the statutory carryforward periods. The 
Company expects to generate higher levels of future taxable income than 
these levels. In determining whether management’s projections of future 
taxable income are reliable, management considered objective evidence 
supporting the forecast assumptions as well as recent experience which 
demonstrates the Company’s ability to reasonably project future results of 
operations. The analysis showed that credit losses will continue to be at 
elevated levels but will continue to trend downward, and that credit quality 
indicators will continue to improve. Further, while the banking environment 
is expected to remain challenging due to economic and other uncertainties, 
the Company believes that it can conﬁ dently forecast future taxable income 
at sufﬁ cient levels over the future period of time that the Company has 
available to red tax asset.
Synovus expects to rmillion in net deferred tax assets well 
in advance of the statutory carryforwar
apprmillion of existing deferred tax assets are not related 
to net operating losses or credits and therefore, have no expiration date. 
Apprmillion of the remaining deferred tax assets relate 
to federal net operating losses which will expire in annual installments

While we recently reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, we may not 
be able to realize these assets in the future and they may be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating 
results and regulatory capital ratios.
”The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of 
NOLs if there has been an “ownership change” as deﬁ ned in Section 382 of 
the IRC. In general, this would occur if certain ownership changes related 
to our common stock that is held by 5% or greater shareholders exceed 
50 percent measured over a rolling three year period. If we experience 
such an ownership change, our utilization of NOLs to reduce future federal 
income tax obligations could be limited. To reduce the likelihood of such 
an ownership change, Synovus adopted a Rights Plan in 2010 that was ratiﬁ ed by Synovus shareholders in 2011. The Rights Plan will expire in 
of 2013. The Board of Directors could determine to extend the term 
of the Rights Plan upon the expiration of its current term or adopt another 
Rights Plan, subject to subsequent ratiﬁ cation by Synovus shareholders, if 
it is determined that the NOLs are at risk of limitation under Section 382 or 
that such action is otherwise in the best interest of Synovus’ shareholders.
Credit Quality
During 2012, credit quality has improved at an accelerated pace as NPAs,

Asset DispositionsDuring 2009, the Company began its asset disposition strategy, which 
centers around disposition of distressed assets, as a proactive measure 
in managing the loan portfolio. Subsequent to the implementation of the 
asset disposition strategy, Synovus entered into the Synovus MOU. The 
Synovus MOU was in alignment with the existing asset disposition strategy, 
including managing various asset quality and regulatory capital ratios. 
During 2012, Synovus continued to decrease the level of distressed assets 
through dispositions. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Synovus completed

Troubled Debt Restructurings
When borrowers are experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, the Company may, 
in order to assist the borrowers in repaying the principal and interest 
owed to the Company, make certain modiﬁ cations to the borrower’s 
loan. All loan modiﬁ cations and renewals are evaluated for troubled debt 
restructuring (TDR) classiﬁ cation. In accordance with ASU 2011-02, 
A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt 
Restructuring, 2011, a TDR is deﬁ ned as a modiﬁ cation 
with a borrower that is experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, and the company 
has granted a ﬁ nancial concession that it would not normally make. The 
market interest rate concept in ASU 2011-02 states that if a borrower 
does not otherwise have access to funds at a market interest rates for 
debt with characteristics similar to those of the restructured debt, the 
restructuring would be considered to be at a below-market rate, which 
indicates that the lender may have granted a concession. Since Synovus often increases or maintains the interest rate upon renewal of a commercial 
loan, including renewals of loans involving borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culties, the market rate concept has become a signiﬁ cant factor in 
determining if a loan is classiﬁ ed as a TDR. All TDR’s are considered to 
be impaired loans, and the amount of impairment, if any, is determined in 
accordance with ASC 310-10-35,
 Accounting By Creditors for Impairment 
of a Loan-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5, ASC 450-20, and 
No. 15, ASC 310-40.Concessions provided by Synovus in a TDR are generally made in order 
to assist borrowers so that debt service is not interrupted and to mitigate 
the potential for loan losses. A number of factors are reviewed when a 
loan is renewed, reﬁ nanced, or modiﬁ ed, including cash ﬂ ows, collateral 
values, guarantees, and loan structures. Concessions are primarily in 
the form of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower’s 
credit risk to assist the borrower in managing cash ﬂ ows, an extension 
of the maturity of the loan generally for less than one year, or a period of 
time generally less than one year with a reduction of required principal

s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
and/or interest payments (e.g., interest only for a period of time). These 
types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the 
maturity of a loan, as a loan renewal. Renewals of loans made to borrowers 
experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties are evaluated for TDR designation by 
determining if concessions are being granted, including consideration 
of whether the renewed loan has an interest rate that is at market, given 
the credit risk related to the loan. Insigniﬁ cant periods of reduction of 
principal and/or interest payments, or one time deferrals of three months 
or less, are generally not considered to be ﬁ nancial concessions. Further, 
it is generally Synovus’ practice not to defer principal and/or interest for 
more than twelve months.
Since 2009, for consumer real estate borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culties that evidence that current monthly payments are unsustainable, 
Synovus has been providing through its consumer real estate home 
affordability program (HAP), a below market interest rate given the borrower’s 
credit risk and/or an extension of the maturity and amortization period 
beyond loan policy limits for renewed loans. All consumer loans restructured 
or modiﬁ ed under HAP ar2012, there were 
e part of the HAP program.
Non-accruing TDRs may generally be returned to accrual status if there 
has been a period of performance, usually at least a six month sustained 
period of repayment performance by the borrower. Consistent with 
regulatory guidance, a TDR will generally no longer be reported as a TDR 
after a period of performance which is generally a minimum of six months and after the loan has been reported as a TDR at a year-end reporting 
date, and if at the time of the modiﬁ cation, the interest rate was at market, 
considering the credit risk associated with the borrower.

Potential Problem Loans
Management continuously monitors non-performing and past due loans to 
mitigate further deterioration regarding the condition of these loans. Potential 
problem loans are deﬁ ned by management as certain performing loans with 
a well-deﬁ ned weakness where there is information about possible credit 
problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to 
the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms 
of such loans. Potential problem commercial loans consist of substandard 
accruing loans but exclude both loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing troubled debt restructurings, which are 
reported separately. Management’s decision to include performing loans 
in the category of potential problem loans indicates that management 
has recognized a higher degree of risk associated with these loans. In 
days past due and accruing restructured 
million of potential problem commercial loans

Management’s current expectation of probable losses from potential problem 
loans is included in the allowance for loan losses, and management cannot 
predict at this time whether these potential problem loans ultimately will 
become non-performing loans or result in losses.

As a ﬁ nancial holding company, Synovus and its subsidiary bank, Synovus 
Bank, are required to maintain capital levels required for a well-capitalized 
institution as deﬁ ned by federal banking regulations. The capital measures 
used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk-based capital 
ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio. Synovus 
Bank is a state-chartered bank under the regulations of the GA DBF. 
Under applicable regulations, Synovus Bank is well-capitalized if it has 
a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 
6% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any 
written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action 
directive from a federal and/or state banking regulatory agency to meet 
and maintain a speciﬁ c capital level for any capital measure. However, 
even if Synovus Bank satisﬁ es all applicable quantitative criteria to be 
considered well-capitalized, the regulations also establish procedures 
for “downgrading” an institution to a lower capital category based on 
2010, Synovus Bank 
entered into a memorandum of understanding with the FDIC and the GA 
DBF agreeing to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 8% and a minimum 
total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%. Management 2012, Synovus and Synovus Bank meet 
all capital requirements to which they are subject.
2012, Synovus and Synovus Bank’s capital have been 
favorably impacted by six and seven consecutive quarters of proﬁ tability, 
respectively24 “Income Taxes” in this Report, at 
2012, management concluded that it was more likely than 
million of the deferred tax assets will be realized based 
upon future taxable income, and as a result rmillion of the 
valuation allowance. Management’s conﬁ dence in the realization of projected 
future taxable income is based on an analysis of the Company’s risk proﬁ le 
and recent trends in ﬁ nancial performance, including credit quality trends. 
The analysis showed that credit losses will continue to be at elevated levels 
but will continue to trend downward, and that credit quality indicators will 
continue to improve. Further, while the banking environment is expected to 
remain challenging due to economic and other uncertainties, the Company 
believes that it can conﬁ dently forecast future taxable income at sufﬁ cient 
levels over the future period of time that the Company has available to 
r2012 deferred tax asset. While there are limitations 
on the inclusion of deferred tax assets for regulatory capital based on Tier

While we recently reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, we may not be able to realize these assets in the future and they may be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.
”While the level of credit losses has declined signiﬁ cantly from the peak 
with all key credit quality measures continuing to improve, current levels 
of credit losses and non-performing assets remain elevated compared to 
historical levels as a result of an extended period of economic downturn 
States economy. The cumulative 
effect of these credit losses over recent years has negatively impacted 
Synovus’ capital position. As a result, Synovus completed a number of 
steps to strengthen its capital position as described below. As Synovus 
emerges from the ﬁ nancial crisis, management continuously and actively 
manages capital, including forecasting and stress testing in line with 
rof 2012 for both expected and more 
adverse economic conditions, and will pursue additional strategies designed 
to bolster its capital position when and as deemed necessary. If credit 
losses exceed management’s current expectations, they could adversely 
impact Synovus’ capital ratios.SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.

2009, and 2010, Synovus completed several public offerings 
and other capital actions.2008, Synovus issued 967,870 shares of Series A Preferred 
States Department of the Treasury as part of the 
CPPmillion of Tier 1 Capital. During 2009 and 2010, 
Synovus issued an aggregate of 443,250,000 shares of Common Stock

Capital” of this Report for further information regarding the 2009 and 
2010 common stock offerings, tMED offering, and other actions taken 
to bolster capital.2012, the U.S. banking regulatory agencies released three NPRs 
to revise regulatory capital rules for U.S. banking organizations and align 
them with the Basel III capital standards. The NPRs are also designed to 
comply with various aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. Two of the NPRs would 
apply to Synovus and have broad applicability to U.S. banking organizations 
regardless of size, with the exception of small bank holding companies 
million). The proposed rules establish more 
stringent capital standards through more restrictive capital deﬁ nitions, higher 
risk-weighted assets, additional capital buffers, and higher requirements 
for minimum capital ratios. However2012, regulators 
announced that the implementation of these rules would be delayed and did not provide a speciﬁ c time frame for their implementation. Synovus 
is currently reviewing the proposed rules and the impact these changes 
would have on regulatory capital.
Management currently believes, based on internal capital analyses and 
earnings projections, that Synovus’ capital position is adequate to meet 
current and proposed regulatory minimum capital requirements. However, 
Synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry 
capital standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, 
and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital 
at both Synovus and Synovus Bank. Synovus Bank’s classiﬁ ed assets, 
as a percentage of Tier 1 capital and the allowance for loan losses, 
2012, compared to 62.51% at 
2011. Synovus Financial Corp.’s classiﬁ ed asset ratio was 
2012. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with the Company’s repayment of TARP 
and strategies that may be required to meet the requirements of Basel III 
and other regulatory initiatives regarding capital. Management currently 
expects to repay TARP no later than the fourth quarter of 2013, subject 
to regulatory approval.
LiquidityLiquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available 
sources of funding needed to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers 
and creditors, to support asset growth, and to otherwise sustain operations 
of Synovus and its subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely basis, 
and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus’ economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring, 
monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk, interest rate risk, 
and market risk and has the authority to establish policies relative to these 
risks. ALCO, operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by 
the Board of Directors, actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash 
ﬂ ows in order to properly manage Synovus’ liquidity position.
Contractual and anticipated cash ﬂ ows are analyzed under normal and 
stressed conditions to determine forward looking liquidity needs and 
sources. Synovus analyzes liquidity needs under various scenarios of 
market conditions and operating performance. This analysis includes 
stress testing and measures expected sources and uses of funds under 
each scenario. Emphasis is placed on maintaining numerous sources of 

current and potential liquidity to allow Synovus to meet its obligations to 

depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis.
Liquidity is generated primarily through maturities and repayments of 
loans by customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, deposit growth, and access to sources of funds other than deposits. Management 
continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as 
to provide adequate funding sources to meet estimated customer deposit 
withdrawals and future loan requests. Liquidity is also enhanced by the 
acquisition of new deposits. Each of the banking divisions monitors deposit 
ﬂ ows and evaluates alternate pricing structures in an effort to retain and 
grow deposits. Customer conﬁ dence is a critical element in growing and 
retaining deposits. In this regard, Synovus’ asset quality could play a 
larger role in the stability of the deposit base. In the event asset quality 
declines signiﬁ cantly from its current level, the ability to grow and retain 
deposits could be diminished, which in turn could reduce deposits as a 
liquidity source.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, ef2010, 
unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing demand 
transaction accounts was extended thr2012. This 
component of the Dodd-Frank Act served to extend unlimited insurance coverage which was initially established by the TAGP. Insurance coverage 
for non-interest bearing demand deposits declined to $250,000 per 
2012. As of the ﬁ ling date of this Report, 
the expiration of this unlimited coverage has had a very modest effect 
on Synovus’ deposit balances. Synovus’ ability to retain these deposits 
will depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions 
and the operating performance and crI

Synovus Bank issues longer-term certiﬁ cates of deposit across a broad 
geographic base to increase its liquidity and funding position. Access to 
these deposits could become more limited if Synovus Bank’s asset quality 
and ﬁ nancial performance were to signiﬁ cantly deteriorate. Synovus Bank

2012, Synovus Bank had access to incremental

utilization of FHLB advances.In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity 
at the Parent Company for various operating needs including potential capital 
infusions into subsidiaries, the servicing of debt, the payment of dividends 
on our Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, and payment of 
general corporate expenses. The primary source of liquidity for Synovus 
consists of dividends from Synovus Bank which is governed by certain 
rules and regulations of the GA DBF and FDIC. Dividends from Synovus 
Bank in 2010 wermillion. During 2011 and 2012 Synovus Bank

dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number 
of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank’s future proﬁ ts, 
asset quality and overall condition. Synovus may not receive dividends 
from Synovus Bank in 2013, which could adversely affect liquidity. See

s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Inﬂ ationA ﬁ nancial institution’s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature; 
therefore, inﬂ ation can have an important impact on the growth of total 
assets in the banking industry and may create a need to increase equity 
capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital 
ratios. Interest rate levels are also signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced by changes in 
the rate of inﬂ ation although they do not necessarily change at the same 
time or magnitude as the inﬂ ation rate. These changes could adversely 
impact Synovus’ ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ tability. Synovus attempts to 
mitigate the effects of inﬂ ation and changing interest rates by managing 
its interest rate sensitivity position through its asset/liability management 
practices and by periodically adjusting its pricing of services and banking products in an efII 
7A. Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity” of this Report for 
further information.Deﬂ ationAn extended period of deﬂ ation could negatively impact the banking industry 
and may be associated with lower growth and a general deterioration of 
the economy. Such a scenario could impair bank earnings and proﬁ tability 
in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, decreases in the value of 
collateral for loans, a diminished ability of borrowers to service their debts, 
increases in the value of certain bank liabilities, and lessened demand for 
loans. While these effects cannot be fully accounted for, Synovus attempts 
to mitigate such risks through prudent underwriting of loans and through 
the management of its interest rate sensitivity position.
Parent Company
The Parent Company’s assets, primarily its investment in subsidiaries, are 
funded, for the most part, by shareholders’ equity. It also utilizes short-term 
and long-term debt. The Parent Company is responsible for providing the 
necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries, acquire new 
businesses, fund internal growth, pay corporate operating expenses, and 
pay dividends to its shareholders. These operations have historically been 
funded by dividends and fees received from subsidiaries, and borrowings 
from outside sources. However, as a result of the challenging economic 
conditions, Synovus did not receive any dividends from Synovus Bank 
during 2012 and 2011 and received signiﬁ cantly less in dividends from 
Synovus Bank during 2010 than in previous years. Additionally, the Parent 
Company was required to provide higher levels of capital infusions to 
subsidiaries during 2010. Thus, Synovus has taken a number of steps to strengthen its capital and liquidity positions as described below. As 
Synovus Bank emerges from the recent ﬁ nancial crisis, Synovus expects 
to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods. However, 
Synovus’ ability to receive dividends from Synovus Bank will depend on 
a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank’s future 
proﬁ ts, asset quality and overall ﬁ nancial condition. Synovus expects that 
it will receive dividends from Synovus Bank during 2013. If Synovus does 
not receive dividends from Synovus Bank during 2013, Synovus’ liquidity 
could be adversely affected. In particular, failure to receive dividends from 
Synovus Bank will impair Synovus’ ability to repay TARP in full without 
issuing substantially more debt or equity than it otherwise anticipates will 
be required.
2009, and 2010, Synovus completed several public offerings 
and other capital actions.2008, Synovus issued 967,870 shares of Series A Preferred

es About Market Risk
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market RiskMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Market risk reﬂ ects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes 
in market prices and interest rates. This risk of loss can be reﬂ ected in 
either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential 
net income. Synovus’ most signiﬁ cant market risk is interest rate risk. This 
risk arises primarily from Synovus’ core community banking activities of 
extending loans and accepting deposits.Managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management 
function. Synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income 
while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates. Synovus 
seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing 
characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of 
derivative instruments. Synovus manages its exposure to ﬂ uctuations 
in interest rates through policies established by ALCO and approved by 
the Board of Directors. ALCO meets periodically and has responsibility 
for developing asset liability management policies, reviewing the interest 
rate sensitivity of Synovus, and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning.
Synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through 
the utilization of simulation modeling. On at least a quarterly basis, the following twenty-four month time period is simulated to determine a baseline 
net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in 
interest rates. The baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or ﬂ at interest 
rate environment. These simulations include all of Synovus’ earning assets, 
liabilities, and derivative instruments. Forecasted balance sheet changes, 
primarily reﬂ ecting loan and deposit growth and mix forecasts, are included 
in the periods modeled. Projected rates for loans and deposits are based 
on management’s outlook and local market conditions.
The magnitude and velocity of rate changes among the various asset and liability groups exhibit different characteristics for each possible interest 
rate scenario; additionally, customer loan and deposit preferences can 
vary in response to changing interest rates. Simulation modeling enables 
Synovus to capture the expected effect of these differences. Synovus is 
also able to model expected changes in the shape of interest rate yield 
curves for each rate scenario. Simulation also enables Synovus to capture 
the effect of expected prepayment level changes on selected assets and 
liabilities subject to prepayment.
Synovus’ rate sensitivity position is indicated by selected results of net 
interest income simulations. In these simulations, Synovus has modeled 
the impact of a gradual increase in short-term interest rates of 100 and 
basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the 
next year. Due to short-term interest rates being at or near 0% at this time, 
only rising rate scenarios have been modeled. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity model indicates that, compared 
with a net interest income forecast assuming stable rates, net interest 
income is projected to increase by 1.6% and increase by 2.1% if interest 
rates incrbasis points, respectively. These changes 
were within Synovus’ policy limit of a maximum 5% negative change.

The measured interest rate sensitivity indicates a moderately asset sensitive 
position over the next year, which could serve to improve net interest 
income in a rising interest rate environment. The actual realized change 
in net interest income would depend on several factors, some of which 
could serve to diminish or eliminate the asset sensitivity noted above. 
These factors include a higher than projected level of deposit customer 
migration to higher cost deposits, such as certiﬁ cates of deposit, which 
would increase total interest expense and serve to reduce the realized level 
of asset sensitivity. Another factor which could impact the realized interest 
rate sensitivity is the repricing behavior of interest bearing non-maturity 
deposits. Assumptions for repricing are expressed as a beta relative to 
the change in the prime rate. For instance, a 50% beta would correspond 
to a deposit rate that would increase 0.5% for every 1% increase in the 
prime rate. Projected betas for interest bearing non-maturity deposit 
repricing are a key component of determining the Company’s interest rate 
risk positioning. Should realized betas be higher than projected betas, 
the expected beneﬁ t from higher interest rates would be diminished. The 
following table presents an example of the potential impact of an increase 
in repricing betas on Synovus’ realized interest rate sensitivity position.

While all of the above estimates are reﬂ ective of the general interest rate 
sensitivity of Synovus, local market conditions and their impact on loan 
and deposit pricing would be expected to have a signiﬁ cant impact on 
the realized level of net interest income. Actual realized balance sheet 
growth and mix would also impact the realized level of net interest income.
Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenues, which include trust, 
brokerage, and ﬁ nancial planning fees, can be affected by risk in the 
securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A signiﬁ cant 
portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of 
asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an 
adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account 
assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage customer activity, are also subject 
to market risk. This risk is not considered signiﬁ cant, as trading activities 
are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Mortgage banking income is 
also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to 
levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income 
could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates. The 
extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also 
subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time 
period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk 
management tools, the primary of which are forward sales commitments 
and best efforts commitments.
Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management
As part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus 
utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types 
of interest rate risks. These derivative instruments generally consist of 
interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments made to prospective 
mortgage loan customers, and commitments to sell ﬁ xed-rate mortgage 
loans. Interest rate lock commitments represent derivative instruments 
when it is intended that such loans will be sold.From time to time, Synovus utilizes interest rate swaps to manage interest 
rate risks primarily arising from its core banking activities. These interest 
rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating 
interest rate payment obligations without the exchange of underlying 
principal amounts. Swaps may be designated as either cash ﬂ ow hedges 
2011, 
Synovus had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts utilized to 
manage interest rate risk.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders  
Synovus Financial Corp.:We have audited Synovus Financial Corp.’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
r2012, based on criteria established in 
Internal 
– Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Synovus Financial Corp.’s 
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over 
ﬁ nancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over ﬁ nancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight BoarStates). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁ nancial 
reporting and the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reﬂ ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Synovus Financial Corp. maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over ﬁ nancial r2012, 
based on criteria established in – Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight BoarStates), the consolidated 
balance sheets of Synovus Financial Corp. and subsidiaries as of

 Summary of Signiﬁ
 cant Accounting PoliciesBusiness OperationsThe consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Synovus include the accounts of 
the Parent Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Synovus provides 
integrated ﬁ nancial services, including commercial and retail banking, 
ﬁ nancial management, insurance, and mortgage services to its customers 
through 29 locally-branded divisions of its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, 
Synovus Bank, and other ofﬁ ces in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, 
Florida, and Tennessee.
Basis of Presentation
The accounting and reporting policies of Synovus conform to accounting 
States (GAAP) and to general 
practices within the banking and ﬁ nancial services industries. All signiﬁ cant 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in 
consolidation. In preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of 
the respective consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could 
differ signiﬁ cantly from those estimates.
Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to signiﬁ cant change 
relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses; the valuation 
of other real estate; the fair value of investment securities; the fair value 
of private equity investments; and the valuation of deferred tax assets. In 
connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of certain impaired loans and other real estate, management 
obtains independent appraisals for signiﬁ cant properties and properties 
collateralizing impaired loans. In making this determination, management 
also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes 
in absorption rates or market conditions at the time of valuation and 
anticipated sales values based on management’s plans for disposition.
The following is a description of the Company’s signiﬁ cant accounting 
policies.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks. At 
2012 and 2011, cash and cash equivalents included 
espectively, on deposit to meet Federal 
Reserve Bank requirmillion 
of the due from banks balance is restricted as to withdrawal, including 
Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments consist of interest bearing funds with the Federal 
Reserve Bank, interest earning deposits with banks, and federal funds sold 
and securities purchased under resale agreements. Interest earning deposits

2011, which is pledged as collateral in connection 
with certain letters of cr
2011, which is 
pledged to collateralize certain derivative instruments in a net liability position. 
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, 
generally mature in one day.
Trading Account Assets
Trading account assets, which are primarily held on a short-term basis for 
the purpose of selling at a proﬁ t, consist of debt and equity securities and 
are reported at fair value. Fair value adjustments and fees from trading 
account activities are included as a component of other fee income on 
the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses realized from 
the sale of trading account assets are determined by speciﬁ c identiﬁ cation 
and are included as a component of other fee income on the trade date. 
Interest income on trading assets is reported as a component of interest 
income on the consolidated statements of operations.Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Mortgage 
Banking IncomeMortgage Loans Held for SaleMortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value. Fair value is derived 
from a hypothetical bulk sale valuation model used to estimate the exit price 
of the loan in a loan sale. The bid pricing convention is used for loan pricing 
for similar assets. The valuation model is based upon forward settlements of 
a pool of loans of identical coupon, maturity, product, and credit attributes. 
The inputs to the model are continuously updated with available market 
and historical data. As the loans are sold in the secondary market, the 
valuation model produces an estimate of fair value that represents the 
highest and best use of the loans in Synovus’ principal market.Mortgage Banking IncomeMortgage banking income consists primarily of origination, ancillary fees, 
and gains and losses from the sale of mortgage loans. Mortgage loans 
are sold servicing released, without recourse or continuing involvement,

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, 
criteria for sale accounting.Other Loans Held for SaleLoans are transferred to other loans held for sale at fair value when 
Synovus makes the determination to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans. The 
fair value of other loans held for sale is primarily determined by analyzing the net sales proceeds for similar loans sold or in certain cases, based 
upon the contract price or appraised value. At the time of transfer, if the 
fair value is less than the carrying amount, the difference is recorded as 
a charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. Decreases in the fair 
value subsequent to the transfer, as well as gains/losses realized from 
sale of these loans, are recognized as gains/losses on other loans held 
for sale, net, a component of non-interest expense on the consolidated 
statements of operations.SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.

Investment Securities Available for Sale
Investment securities available for sale are carried at fair value with 
unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, excluded from 
earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity 
within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized.
Synovus performs a quarterly assessment of its investment securities 
available for sale to determine if the decline in fair value of a security 
below its amortized cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Other-
than-temporary impairment losses are recognized on securities when: (1) 
the holder has an intention to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not 
that the security will be required to be sold prior to recovery; or (3) the 
holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the 
security. Other-than-temporary impairment losses are reﬂ ected in earnings 
as a charge against investment securities gains (losses), net, to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment 
related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss). Synovus has no intention to sell any securities in an unrealized loss 
2012, prior to the recovery of the unrealized 
loss, nor is it more likely than not that Synovus would be required to 
sell such securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized losses. As of 
2012, Synovus believes that all impairments of investment 
securities are temporary in nature.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the 
related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
and prepayment assumptions. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed 
periodically and the timing of the accretion and amortization is adjusted 
accordingly. Interest income on securities available for sale is recorded 
on the accrual basis. Dividend and interest income are recognized when 
earned. Realized gains and losses for securities are included in investment 
securities gains (losses), net, on the consolidated statements of operations 
and are derived using the speciﬁ c identiﬁ cation method, on a trade date 

basis, for determining the amortized cost of securities sold.Loans and Interest Income on Loans
Loans are reported at principal amounts outstanding less amounts charged 
off, net of deferred fees and expenses. Interest income and deferred fees, 
net of expenses on loans are recognized on a level yield basis.
Non-accrual LoansLoans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated 
as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest is discontinued on loans when 
reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection of interest or principal, or 
when loans become contractually past due for 90 days or more as to either 
interest or principal, in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, 
unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. When a 
loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected 
interest is generally reversed as an adjustment to interest income on loans. 
Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are generally applied 
as a reduction of principal. As payments are received on non-accruing 
loans, interest income can be recognized on a cash basis; however, 
there must be an expectation of full repayment of the remaining recorded 
principal balance. The remaining portion of this payment is recorded as 
a reduction to principal. Loans are generally returned to accruing status 
when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal 
and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to 
be fully collectible as to both principal and interest, and the borrower has 
sustained repayment performance under the terms of the loan agreement 
for a reasonable period of time (generally six months).
Impaired Loans
Impaired loans are loans for which it is probable that Synovus will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the 
loan agreements and all loans modiﬁ ed in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR). Other than TDRs, impaired loans do not include smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, which 
consist of most retail loans and commer
Impairment is measured on a discounted cash ﬂ ow method based upon 
the loan’s contractual effective interest rate, or at the loan’s observable 
market price, or at the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest income on non-accrual impaired loans 
is recognized as described above under “non-accrual loans.” Impaired 
accruing loans generally consist of those troubled debt restructurings for 
which management has concluded that the collectability of the loan is not in doubt.2012, substantially all non-accrual impaired loans were 
collateral-dependent. Most of these loans were secured by real estate. For 
impairment measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less costs 
to sell, fair value is estimated using appraisals performed by a certiﬁ ed or 
licensed appraiser. Management also considers other factors or recent 
developments, such as selling costs and anticipated sales values, taking into account management’s plans for disposition, which could result in 
adjustments to the fair value estimates indicated in the appraisals. The assumptions used in determining the amount of the impairment are subject 
to signiﬁ cant judgment. Use of different assumptions, for example, changes 
in the fair value of the collateral or management’s plans for disposition 
could have a signiﬁ cant impact on the amount of impairment.
Under the discounted cash ﬂ ow method, impairment is recorded as a 
speciﬁ c reserve with a charge-off for any portion of the speciﬁ c reserve 
considered a conﬁ rmed loss. The reserve is reassessed each quarter and 
adjusted as appropriate based on changes in estimated cash ﬂ ows. The 
discounted cash ﬂ ow method requires the projection of the timing and 
amount of the best estimate of future cash ﬂ ows from the borrower’s net 
rents received from the property, guarantor contributions, sales of collateral 
or other properties, reﬁ nances, etc. Once the amount and timing of the 
cash ﬂ ow stream has been estimated, the net present value using the loan’s 
effective interest rate is calculated to determine the amount of impairment.
Where guarantors are determined to be a source of repayment, an 
assessment of the guarantee is required. This guarantee assessment 
would include, but not be limited to, factors such as type and feature of 
the guarantee, consideration for the guarantor’s ﬁ nancial strength and 
capacity to service the loan in combination with the guarantor’s other 
ﬁ nancial obligations as well as the guarantor’s willingness to assist in 
servicing the loan.Troubled Debt Restructurings
When borrowers are experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, the Company may, 
in order to assist the borrowers in repaying the principal and interest owed 
to the Company, make certain modiﬁ cations to the borrower’s loan. All loan 
modiﬁ cations and renewals are evaluated for troubled debt restructuring 

(TDR) classiﬁ cation. In accor2011-02, 
A Creditor’s 
Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, 
2011, a TDR is deﬁ ned as a modiﬁ cation with a borrower 
that is experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, and the company has granted a 
ﬁ nancial concession that it would not normally make. The market interest 
2011-02 states that if a borrower does not 
otherwise have access to funds at a market interest rates for debt with 
characteristics similar to those of the restructured debt, the restructuring 
would be considered to be at a below-market rate, which indicates that 
the lender may have granted a concession. Since Synovus often increases 
or maintains the interest rate upon renewal of a commercial loan, including 
renewals of loans involving borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, 
the market rate concept has become a signiﬁ cant factor in determining 
if a loan is classiﬁ ed as a TDR. All TDR’s are considered to be impaired 
loans, and the amount of impairment, if any, is determined in accordance 
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
88PAR 
310-10-35, 
Accounting By Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-an amendment of F15, 
Concessions provided by Synovus in a TDR are generally made in order 
to assist borrowers so that debt service is not interrupted and to mitigate 
the potential for loan losses. A number of factors are reviewed when a 
loan is renewed, reﬁ nanced, or modiﬁ ed, including cash ﬂ ows, collateral 
values, guarantees, and loan structures. Concessions are primarily in 
the form of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower’s 
credit risk to assist the borrower in managing cash ﬂ ows, an extension 
of the maturity of the loan generally for less than one year, or a period of 
time generally less than one year with a reduction of required principal 
and/or interest payments (e.g., interest only for a period of time). These 
types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the 
maturity of a loan, as a loan renewal. Renewals of loans made to borrowers 
experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties are evaluated for TDR designation by 
determining if concessions are being granted, including consideration 
of whether the renewed loan has an interest rate that is at market, given 
the credit risk related to the loan. Insigniﬁ cant periods of reduction of 
principal and/or interest payments, or one time deferrals of three months 
or less, are generally not considered to be ﬁ nancial concessions. Further, 
it is generally Synovus’ practice not to defer principal and/or interest for 
more than twelve months.
These types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the maturity of a loan, in which the borrower is experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culty, as a loan renewal.
Renewals of loans made to borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties 
are evaluated for TDR designation by determining if concession(s) are 
being granted, including consideration of whether the renewed loan has 
an interest rate that is at market, given the credit risk related to the loan.
Non-accruing TDRs may generally be returned to accrual status if there has 
been a period of performance, usually at least a six month sustained period 
of repayment performance by the borrower. Consistent with regulatory 
guidance, a TDR will generally no longer be reported as a TDR after a 
period of performance and after the loan was reported as a TDR at a year-
end reporting date, and if at the time of the modiﬁ cation, the interest rate 
was at market, considering the credit risk associated with the borrower.
Allowance for Loan LossesThe allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus for accuracy and consistency between the changes 
in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in 
the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses consist of two components: 
the allocated and unallocated allowances. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on an analysis, which assesses the inherent risk 
for probable loss within the loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant judgments and 
estimates are necessary in the determination of the allowance for loan 
losses. Signiﬁ cant judgments include, among others, loan risk ratings and 
classiﬁ cations, the determination and measurement of impaired loans, the 
timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan defaults, the net loss 
exposure in the event of loan defaults, qualitative loss factors, as well as other 
environmental and economic considerations. In determining an adequate 
allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, 
estimates, and assessments, which are inherently subjective. The use of 
different estimates or assumptions could have a signiﬁ cant impact on the 
provision for loan losses, allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans, 
loan charge-offs, and other credit metrics.
Commer
The allocated allowance for commercial loans is based upon quarterly 
analyses of impaired commercial loans to determine the amount of speciﬁ c 
reserves (and/or loan charge-offs), if any, as well as an analysis of historical 
loan default experience, loan net loss experience and related qualitative 
factors, if appropriate, for categories of loans with similar risk attributes 
and further segregated by Synovus’ internal loan grading system.
Impaired loans are generally evaluated on a loan by loan basis with speciﬁ c 
reserves recorded as appropriate. Speciﬁ c reserves are determined based 
310-10-35, which provides for measurement of a loan’s impairment 
based on one of three methods. If the loan is collateral dependent, then the 
fair value of the loan’s collateral, less estimated selling costs are compared 
to the loan’s carrying amount to determine impairment. Other methods of 
measuring a loan’s impairment include the present value of the expected 
future cash ﬂ ows of the loan, or if available, the observable market price 
of the loan. Synovus considers the pertinent facts and circumstances for 
each impaired loan when selecting a method to measure impairment, and 
quarterly evaluates each selection to ensure its continued appropriateness 
and evaluates the reasonableness of speciﬁ c reserves, if any.
For loans that are not considered impaired, the allocated allowance for 
loan losses is determined based upon Expected Loss (“EL”) factors, which 
are applied to groupings of speciﬁ c loan types by loan risk ratings. The 
EL is determined based upon a probability of default (“PD”), which is the 

probability that a borrower, segregated by loan type and loan risk grade, 
will default, and loss given default (“LGD”), which is the estimate of the amount of net loss in the event of default. The allocated EL factors for commercial loans are also adjusted, as necessary, by qualitative factor 
considerations for the applicable loan categories, which include, among 
other considerations, the aging of portfolio default experience data used in the PD calculation, and the aging of the portfolio net loss experience data used in the LGD calculation. The groupings of the loans into loan 
categories are determined based upon the nature of the loan types and 
the level of inherent risk associated with the various loan categories. The 
loan groupings are further segregated based upon the individual loan risk 
ratings, as described below.
The risk ratings are based on the borrowers’ credit risk proﬁ le, considering 
factors such as debt service history, current and estimated prospective cash 
ﬂ ow information, collateral supporting the credit, source of repayment as 
well as other variables, as appropriate. Ratings six through nine are deﬁ ned 
consistent with the bank regulatory classiﬁ cations of special mention, 
substandard, doubtful, and loss, respectively. Each loan is assigned a risk 
rating during its initial approval process. This process begins with a loan 
rating recommendation from the loan ofﬁ cer responsible for originating 
the loan. The loan rating recommendation is subject to approvals from 
other members of management, regional credit and/or loan committees 
depending on the size of the loan and loan’s credit attributes. Loan ratings 
are regularly reevaluated based upon annual scheduled credit reviews 
or on a more frequent basis if determined prudent by management. 
Additionally, an independent loan review function evaluates Synovus’ risk 
rating process on a continuous basis.
2012, the PD factors are based upon loan defaults 
experienced thr2012, and the LGD factors are based 
upon net losses on defaulted loans thr2012. The 
impact of the one quarter lag in the data used to determine the PD and 2012 was assessed and it was determined 
that the fourth quarter 2012 default and loss given default data would not signiﬁ 2012 analysis. No qualitative 
adjustments to the EL factors were requir2012 or 2011.
The allocated allowance includes reserves for pools of homogeneous 
loans and for impaired loans, which are generally evaluated on a loan 
by loan basis with speciﬁ c reserves recorded, as appropriate. For loans 
that are not considered impaired, the allocated allowance for loan losses 
is determined based upon EL factors which are applied to groupings of 
speciﬁ c loan types, by loan risk rating.
For loans that are not considered impaired, the allocated allowance for 
loan losses is determined based upon Expected Loss (“EL”) factors, which 
are applied to groupings of speciﬁ c loan types by loan risk ratings. The 
EL is determined based upon a probability of default (“PD”), which is the 
probability that a borrower, segregated by loan type and loan risk grade, will 
default, and loss given default (“LGD”), which is the estimate of the amount 
of net loss in the event of default. The allocated EL factorsfor retail loans 
are also adjusted, as necessary, by qualitative factor considerations for the

applicable loan categories, which include, among other considerations, 
the aging of portfolio default experience data used in the PD calculation, and the aging of the portfolio net loss experience data used in the LGD calculation. The groupings of the loans into loan categories are determined 
based upon the nature of the loan types and the level of inherent risk 
associated with the various loan categories. The loan groupings are further 
segregated based upon the individual loan risk ratings, as described below.
As a result of Synovus’ past practice of updating retail default and loss-
given default data once per year, loan default and net loan loss upon 
default data utilized in the PD and LGD calculations did not historically include the most recent periods’ portfolio default and net loss experience; 
therefore, these factors required a qualitative factor adjustment to properly 
capture the estimated inherent risk of loss in the respective loan portfolios 
not identiﬁ ed in the PD or LGD factors because of the time lag in the data 
used for the PD and LGD factors.In 2012, Synovus began updating the loan default data and net loss upon default data utilized in the calculation of the PD factors and LGD factors, 
respectively, at least twice a year. The use of this more current data, as well 
as an expanded default deﬁ nition, eliminated the need for the qualitative 
2012. 
2012, the PD factors were based upon loan defaults 
experienced thr2012, and the LGD factors were 
based upon losses on defaulted loans thr
Retail loans are generally assigned a risk rating on a 6-point scale at the 
time of origination based on credit bureau scores, with a loan grade of 1 

assigned as the lowest level of risk and a loan grade of 6 as the highest level of risk. At 90-119 days past due, a loan grade of 7-substandard rating 
is applied and at 120 days past due, the loan is generally downgraded to grade 9-loss. The credit bureau based ratings are updated at least semi-
annually and the ratings based on the past due status are updated monthly.
Unallocated Allowance for Loan LossesThe unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is considered 
necessary to provide for certain environmental and economic factors that 
affect the inherent risk of loss in the entire loan portfolio that are not fully 
captured in the allocated allowance for loan losses. Unallocated qualitative 
factors included in the determination of the unallocated allowance for loan losses include the following: •effects of any changes in underwriting standards, and other changes in 
lending policies, procedures and practices
 •experience, ability and depth of lending management, loan review 
personnel and other relevant staff
 •national and local economic trends and conditions
 •underlying value of collateral dependent loans, which impacts trends in 
charge-offs and recoveries that are not included in the expected loss factors
 •levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans not included in 
the expected loss factors •effects of changes in credit concentrations
 •trends in volume and terms of loans
 •other isolated eventsOn a quarterly basis, management updates its analysis and consideration of these factors and determines the impact, if any, on the allowance for 
loan losses and the provision for loan losses for each respective period. 
The unallocated re2012 was

decrease is primarily due to further stabilization in the fair value of real 
estate collateral in our market area, which positively impacts the inherent 
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment, including bank owned branch locations and 
leasehold improvements, are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and amortization, which are computed using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remainder of 
the lease term. Synovus reviews long-lived assets, such as premises and 
equipment, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of 
identiﬁ able net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with 
350-
Intangibles, Goodwill and Other, 
goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at the reporting unit (sub-segment) level on an annual 
basis and as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely 
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.

intangibles. The r2 is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the 
2 implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.
Signiﬁ cant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. 
This judgment includes developing cash ﬂ ow projections, selecting 
appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, 
incorporating general economic and market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium. The selection and weighting of the various 
fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment 
is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of 
fair value.Other Real EstateORE consists of properties obtained through a foreclosure proceeding or 
through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. In accordance 
with the pr310-10-35 regarding subsequent measurement 
310-40-15 regarding accounting for 
troubled debt restructurings by a creditor, a loan is classiﬁ ed as an in-
substance foreclosure when Synovus has taken possession of the collateral 
regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place.
At foreclosure, ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the 
estimated cost to sell, which establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, ORE is evaluated quarterly and reported at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell, not to exceed the new cost basis, determined on the basis of current appraisals, as well as the review of comparable sales 
and other estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent 
sources, changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time 
of the latest appraisal received or previous re-evaluation performed, and 
anticipated sales values considering management’s plans for disposition.
Synovus’ objective is to dispose of ORE properties in a timely manner 
and to maximize net sale proceeds. Synovus has a centralized managed 
assets division, with the specialized skill set to facilitate this objective. While 
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
90PAR 
there is not a deﬁ ned timeline for their sale, ORE properties are actively 
marketed through unafﬁ liated third parties, including real estate brokers 
and real estate auctioneers. Sales are made on an opportunistic basis, 
as acceptable buyers and terms are identiﬁ ed. In addition, Synovus may 
also decide to sell ORE properties in bulk asset sales to unafﬁ liated third 
parties, in which case the typical period of marketing the property will likely 
not occur. In some cases, Synovus is approached by potential buyers of 
ORE properties or Synovus may contact independent third parties who 
we believe might have an interest in an ORE property.
Other AssetsOther assets include accrued interest receivable and other signiﬁ cant 
balances as described below.
Investments in Company-Owned Life Insurance PoliciesInvestments in company-owned life insurance policies on certain current 
and former ofﬁ cers of Synovus are recorded at the net realizable value of 
the policies as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Net realizable value is the cash surrender value of the policies 
less any applicable surrender charges and any policy loans. Synovus 
has not borrowed against the cash surrender value of these policies. The 
appreciation in the cash surrender value of the policies is recognized as a 
component of other non-interest income in the consolidated statements 

of operations.Private Equity InvestmentsPrivate equity investments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated 
balance sheets with realized and unrealized gains and losses included 
in increase/(decrease) in fair value of private equity investments, net, on 
the consolidated statements of operations in accor946, 
Financial Services-Investment Companies. 
The private equity investments in which Synovus holds a limited partner interest consist of funds that invest 
in privately held companies. For privately held companies in the fund, the general partner estimates the fair value of the company in accordance with 
GAAP as clariﬁ 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. 
The estimated fair value of the company is the estimated fair value as 
an exit price the fund would receive if it were to sell the company in 
the marketplace. The fair value of the fund’s underlying investments is 
estimated through the use of valuation models, such as option pricing 
or a discounted cash ﬂ ow model. Valuation factors such as a company’s 
operational performance against budget or milestones, last price paid by 
investors, with consideration given on whether ﬁ nancing is provided by 
insiders or unrelated new investors, public market comparables, liquidity 
of the market, industry and economic trends, and change of management 
or key personnel, are used in the determination of estimated fair value.
Derivative InstrumentsSynovus’ risk management policies emphasize the management of interest 
rate risk within acceptable guidelines. Synovus’ objective in maintaining these policies is to limit volatility in net interest income arising from changes 
in interest rates. Risks to be managed include both fair value and cash 
ﬂ ow risks. Utilization of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments provides a valuable 
tool to assist in the management of these risks.In accor815, 
Derivatives and Hedging, all derivative 
instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their 
respective fair values, as components of other assets and other liabilities.
The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., unrealized gains or losses) 
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualiﬁ es as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for 
holding it. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a 
derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values, 
cash ﬂ ows, or foreign currencies. If the hedged exposure is a fair value 
exposure, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is 
recognized in earnings in the period of change, together with the offsetting 
unrealized loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being 
hedged as a component of other non-interest income on the consolidated 
statements of operations. If the hedged exposure is a cash ﬂ ow exposure, 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedged item is reported 
initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss), net of the tax impact, and subsequently reclassiﬁ ed into earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded 
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, as well as the ineffective 
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, are reported in 
earnings immediately as a component of other non-interest income on 
the consolidated statements of operations. If the derivative instrument is 
not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings as a component of other non-interest income 
on the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. At 2012, Synovus does not have any derivative instruments 

which are measured for ineffectiveness using the short-cut method.
With the exception of certain commitments to fund and sell ﬁ xed-rate 
mortgage loans and derivatives utilized to meet the ﬁ nancing and interest 
rate risk management needs of its customers, all derivatives utilized by Synovus to manage its interest rate sensitivity are designated as either a 
hedge of a recognized ﬁ xed-rate asset or liability (fair value hedge), or a 
hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of future cash ﬂ ows 
of a ﬂ oating rate asset or liability (cash ﬂ ow hedge). Synovus does not 
speculate using derivative instruments.Synovus may utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fair value 
risk of ﬁ xed-rate liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, which 
consist primarily of deposit and long-term debt liabilities. Fair value risk is measured as the volatility in the value of these liabilities as interest 
rates change. Interest rate swaps entered into to manage this risk are 
designed to have the same notional value, as well as similar interest rates 
and interest calculation methods. These agreements entitle Synovus to 
receive ﬁ xed-rate interest payments and pay ﬂ oating-rate interest payments 
based on the notional amount of the swap agreements. Swap agreements 
structured in this manner allow Synovus to effectively hedge the fair value 
risks of these ﬁ xed-rate liabilities. Ineffectiveness from fair value hedges 
is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as other non-
inter2012 and 2011, there were no fair 
value hedges outstanding, and therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
Synovus is potentially exposed to cash ﬂ ow risk due to its holding of 
loans whose interest payments are based on ﬂ oating rate indexes. 
Synovus monitors changes in these exposures and their impact on its 
risk management activities and uses interest rate swap agreements to 
hedge the cash ﬂ ow risk. These agreements entitle Synovus to receive 
ﬁ xed-rate interest payments and pay ﬂ oating-rate interest payments. These 
agreements also allow Synovus to offset the variability of ﬂ oating rate loan 
interest received with the variable interest payments paid on the interest 
rate swaps. The ineffectiveness from cash ﬂ ow hedges is recognized in 
the consolidated statements of operations as other non-interest income. 
2012 and 2011, there were no cash ﬂ ow hedges 
outstanding, and therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
In 2005, Synovus entered into certain forward starting swap contracts 
to hedge the cash ﬂ ow risk of certain forecasted interest payments on a 
forecasted debt issuance. Upon the determination to issue debt, Synovus 
was potentially exposed to cash ﬂ ow risk due to changes in market interest 
rates prior to the placement of the debt. The forward starting swaps 
allowed Synovus to hedge this exposure. Upon placement of the debt, 
these swaps were cash settled concurrent with the pricing of the debt. 
The effective portion of the cash ﬂ ow hedge included in accumulated 
other comprehensive income is being amortized over the life of the debt 

issue as an adjustment to interest expense.
Synovus also holds derivative instruments, which consist of rate lock 
agreements related to expected funding of ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans to 
customers (interest rate lock commitments) and forward commitments to 
sell mortgage-backed securities and individual ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans. 
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
91PAR 
Synovus’ objective in obtaining the forward commitments is to mitigate 
the interest rate risk associated with the interest rate lock commitments 
and the mortgage loans that are held for sale. Both the interest rate 
lock commitments and the forward commitments are reported at fair 
value, with adjustments recorded in current period earnings in mortgage 
banking income.Synovus also enters into interest rate swap agreements to meet the ﬁ nancing 
and interest rate risk management needs of its customers. Upon entering 
into these derivative instruments to meet customer needs, Synovus enters 
into offsetting positions to minimize interest rate risk. These derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments are reported at fair value with any unrealized gain 
or loss recorded in current period earnings in other non-interest income. 
These instruments, and their offsetting positions, are recorded in other 
assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.When using derivatives to hedge fair value and cash ﬂ ow risks, Synovus 
exposes itself to potential credit risk from the counterparty to the hedging 
instrument. This credit risk is normally a small percentage of the notional 
amount and ﬂ uctuates as interest rates change. Synovus analyzes and 
approves credit risk for all potential derivative counterparties prior to execution 
of any derivative transaction. Synovus seeks to minimize credit risk by 
dealing with highly rated counterparties and by obtaining collateralization 
for exposures above certain predetermined limits. If signiﬁ cant counterparty 
risk is determined, Synovus adjusts the fair value of the derivative recorded 
asset balance to consider such risk.Non-interest Income
Service Charges on Deposit AccountsService charges on deposit accounts consist of non-sufﬁ cient funds 
fees, account analysis fees, and other service charges on deposits which 
consist primarily of monthly account fees. Non-sufﬁ cient funds fees are 
recognized at the time when the account overdraft occurs in accordance 
with regulatory guidelines. Account analysis fees consist of fees charged 
to certain commercial demand deposit accounts based upon account 
activity (and reduced by a credit which is based upon cash levels in the 
account). These fees, as well as monthly account fees, are recorded under 
the accrual method of accounting.Fiduciary and Asset Management FeesFiduciary and asset management fees are generally determined based 
upon market values of assets under management as of a speciﬁ ed date 
during the period. These fees are recorded under the accrual method of 

accounting as the services are performed.
Brokerage and Investment Banking Revenue
Brokerage revenue consists primarily of commission income, which 
represents the spread between buy and sell transactions processed, and 
net fees charged to customers on a transaction basis for buy and sell 
transactions processed. Commission income is recorded on a trade-date 
basis. Brokerage revenue also includes portfolio management fees, which 
represent monthly fees charged on a contractual basis to customers for 
the management of their investment portfolios and are recorded under 
the accrual method of accounting.Investment banking revenue represents fees for services arising from 
securities offerings or placements in which Synovus acts as an agent. It 
also includes fees earned from providing advisory services. Revenue is 
recognized at the time the underwriting is completed and the revenue is 

reasonably determinable.
Bankcard Fees
Bankcard fees consist primarily of interchange fees earned, net of fees 
paid, on debit card and credit card transactions. Net fees are recognized 
into income as they are collected.
Income Taxes
Synovus is a domestic corporation that ﬁ les a consolidated federal income 
tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and ﬁ les state income tax 
returns on a consolidated and a separate entity basis with the various taxing 
jurisdictions based on its taxable presence. Synovus accounts for income 
taxes in accor740
, Income Taxes.
 The current income tax 
accrual or receivable is an estimate of the amounts owed to or due from 
taxing authorities in which Synovus conducts business. It also includes 
increases and decreases in the amount of taxes payable for uncertain 
tax positions reported in tax returns for the current and/or prior years.
Synovus uses the asset and liability method to account for future income 
taxes expected to be paid or received (i.e., deferred income taxes). Under 
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the 
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the ﬁ nancial 
statement (GAAP) carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, including operating losses and tax credit 
carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which 
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The 
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates 
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based on available 
evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will 
not be realized. In making this assessment, all sources of taxable income 
available to realize the deferred tax asset are considered including taxable 
income in prior carryback years, future reversals of existing temporary 
differences, tax planning strategies, and future taxable income exclusive 
of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. The predictability 
that future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences, 
will occur is the most subjective of these four sources. Additionally, 
cumulative losses in recent years is considered negative evidence, that 
may be difﬁ cult to overcome, to support a conclusion that future taxable 
income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, is 
sufﬁ cient to realize a deferred tax asset. Judgment is a critical element in 
making this assessment. Changes in the valuation allowance are recorded 
through income tax expense.
Signiﬁ cant estimates used in accounting for income taxes relate to the 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, estimates of the realizability of 
income tax credits, utilization of net operating losses, the determination of 
taxable income, and the determination of temporary differences between 
book and tax bases.Synovus accrues tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on current assumptions regarding the expected outcome by weighing 
the facts and circumstances available at the reporting date. If related tax 
beneﬁ ts of a transaction are not more likely than not of being sustained 
upon examination, Synovus will accrue a tax liability or reduce a deferred 
tax asset for the expected tax impact associated with the transaction. 
Events and circumstances may alter the estimates and assumptions used 
in the analysis of its income tax positions and, accordingly, Synovus’ 
effective tax rate may ﬂ uctuate in the future. Synovus recognizes accrued 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax beneﬁ ts as a 
component of income tax expense.Share-based Compensation
Synovus has a long-term incentive plan under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to grant share-based 
awards to Synovus employees. Synovus’ share-based compensation 
costs associated with employee grants are recorded as a component

92PAR 
of salaries and other personnel expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based compensation costs associated with grants 
made to non-employee directors of Synovus are recorded as a component 
of other operating expenses. Share-based compensation expense for 
service-based awards is recognized net of estimated forfeitures for plan 
participants on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Fair value estimates are made at a speciﬁ c point in time, based on relevant 
market information and other information about the ﬁ nancial instrument. 
These estimates do not reﬂ ect any premium or discount that could result 
from offering for sale, at one time, the entire holdings of a particular 
ﬁ nancial instrument. Because no market exists for a portion of the ﬁ nancial 
instruments, fair value estimates are also based on judgments regarding 
estimated cash ﬂ ows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics 
of various ﬁ nancial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are 
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of signiﬁ cant 
judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes 
in assumptions could signiﬁ cantly affect the estimates.
Management employs independent third-party pricing services to provide 
fair value estimates for Synovus’ investment securities available for sale and 
trading account assets. Fair values for ﬁ xed income investment securities 
and certain derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are typically the prices supplied 
by either a third-party pricing service or an unrelated counterparty, which 
utilize quoted market prices, broker/dealer quotations for identical or 
similar securities, and/or inputs that are observable in the market, either 
directly or indirectly1 securities 
ar2 securities are typically matrix 
priced by a third-party pricing service to calculate the fair value. Such fair 
value measurements consider observable data, such as relevant broker/
dealer quotes, market spreads, cash ﬂ ows, yield curves, live trading levels, 
trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit 
information, and the respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. 
3 instruments’ value is determined using pricing models, discounted 
cash ﬂ ow models and similar techniques, and may also include the use 
of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable 
to the subject asset or liability. These methods of valuation may result 
in a signiﬁ cant portion of the fair value being derived from unobservable 
assumptions that reﬂ ect Synovus’ own estimates for assumptions that 
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Management uses various validation procedures to validate the prices 
received from pricing services and quotations received from dealers are 
reasonable for each relevant ﬁ nancial instrument, including reference to 
relevant broker/dealer quotes or other market quotes and a review of 
valuations and trade activity of comparable securities. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or ﬁ rm) and the relationship 
of recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided by the third-

party pricing service. Further, management also employs the services of 
an additional independent pricing ﬁ rm as a means to verify and conﬁ rm 
the fair values of our primary independent pricing ﬁ rms.
Understanding the third-party pricing service’s valuation methods, 
assumptions and inputs used by the ﬁ rm is an important part of the 
process of determining that reasonable and reliable fair values are being 
obtained. Management evaluates quantitative and qualitative information provided by the third-party pricing services to assess whether they 
continue to exhibit the high level of expertise and internal controls that 
management relies upon.
Fair value estimates are based on existing ﬁ nancial instruments on the 
consolidated balance sheet, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are 
not considered ﬁ nancial instruments. Signiﬁ cant assets and liabilities that 
are not considered ﬁ nancial instruments include deferred income taxes, 
premises and equipment, equity method investments, goodwill and other 
intangible assets. In addition, the income tax ramiﬁ cations related to the 
realization of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment 
securities and cash ﬂ ow hedges can have a signiﬁ cant effect on fair value 
estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Testing Goodwill for Impairment. 
Under the provisions of 
this update to the accounting standards, an entity has the option to ﬁ rst 
assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a 
result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative 
impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An 
entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative 
assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to 
step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative

2011, Synovus announced efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives 
intended to streamline operations, boost productivity, reduce expenses, 
and increase revenue. During 2011, Synovus implemented most of the 
components of the initiatives, which resulted in restructuring charges of 
million. During 2012, Synovus recognized restructuring charges 
million associated with these ongoing efﬁ ciency initiatives. As 
part of these efﬁ branches during 
2011 and 10 branches during 2012. During 2012 and 2011, Synovus transferred prmillion 
million, respectively, immediately preceding the transfer to other 
assets held for sale, a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. During 2011, Synovus recognized impairment charges of 
million related to these assets and net gains of $929 thousand on 
the sale of these assets. During 2012, Synovus recognized impairment 
million related to these assets and net gains of $622 
thousand on the sale of these assets. During 2012 and 2011, Synovus received prmillion, respectively, from sales 
of these assets. The carrying value of the remaining held for sale assets 
2010, Synovus recognized 
apprmillion in restructuring charges related to other cost 
saving strategies.The liability for restructuring activities was $728 thousand at 
2012 which consists primarily of estimated severance 
payments and lease termination payments. Cash payments associated with this liability are expected to occur over the next six months.
Severance charges were recognized in accordance with the one-
time employee termination beneﬁ t pr420-10-25 upon 
management’s commitment to a plan identifying the number of employees 
to be terminated, the terms of the beneﬁ t arrangement, and upon 
communication of this information to the employees to be terminated. While recognition of restructuring charges is triggered by communication 
of the plan and beneﬁ t information to affected employees, the timing of 
recognition depends on whether an employee is required to render further 
service in order to receive the termination beneﬁ ts. For employees who 
are not required to render further service to receive termination beneﬁ ts 
or who are not required to render service beyond a minimum retention 
ecognized on the date of communication 
to affected employees. For employees who are required to work beyond 
the minimum retention period to receive termination beneﬁ ts, the fair value 
of termination beneﬁ ts at the communication date is recognized ratably 
over the future service period.
In accor360-10-35, restructuring charges were recognized 
upon a signiﬁ cant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-
lived asset is being used (removed from service), or upon management’s 
commitment to a plan to sell an asset. Restructuring charges resulting 
from lease termination expenses were recognized in accordance with 
840-30 upon notifying the lessor of Synovus’ intent 
to terminate a lease. Trading Account Assets

 Other Loans Held for Sale
Loans are transferred to other loans held for sale at fair value when Synovus 
makes the determination to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans. The fair value 
of the loans is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of 
the loan and the anticipated market prices of similar assets less estimated costs to sell. At the time of transfer, if the fair value is less than the carrying 
amount, the difference is recorded as a charge-off against the allowance 
for loan losses. Decreases in the fair value subsequent to the transfer, as 
well as gains/losses realized from sale of these loans, are recognized as 
(gains) losses on other loans held for sale, net as a component of non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

(1)  Amortized cost is adjusted for other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2012 and 2011, which have been recognized in the
 consolidated statements of operations in the applicable year, 
and were considered inconsequential.2012 and 2011, investment securities with a carrying 
billion, respectively, were pledged to secure 
certain deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and payment 
network arrangements, as required by law and contractual agreements.
Synovus has reviewed investment securities that are in an unrealized loss 
2012 and 2011 for other-than-temporary 
impairment and does not consider any securities in an unrealized loss 
position to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Synovus does not intend to 
sell any of the investment securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized 
loss, which may not be until maturity, and it is not more likely than not that 
Synovus will be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss 
position. The unrealized losses are related to increases in interest rates 
on comparable securities from the date of purchase. Synovus regularly 
evaluates its investment securities portfolio to ensure that there are no 
conditions that would indicate that unrealized losses represent other-
than-temporary impairment. These factors include length of time that 
the security has been in a loss position, the extent that the fair value has been below amortized cost, and the credit standing of the issuer. As of 
e are 9 securities in a loss position for less than 
twelve months and 6 securities in a loss position for more than 12 months.

The credit quality of the loan portfolio is summarized no less frequently 
than quarterly using the standard asset classiﬁ cation system utilized by 
the federal banking agencies. These classiﬁ cations are divided into three 
gr– Not Classiﬁ ed (Pass), Special Mention, and Classiﬁ ed or Adverse 
rating (Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss) and are deﬁ ned as follows:
–
 loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying 
capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.
–
 loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve 
management’s close attention. These loans are not adversely classiﬁ ed 
and do not expose an institution to sufﬁ cient risk to warrant an adverse 
classiﬁ cation.
Substandar–
 loans which are inadequately protected by the current net 
worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. 
Loans with this classiﬁ cation are characterized by the distinct possibility that 
the institution will sustain some loss if the deﬁ ciencies are not corrected.
–
 loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classiﬁ ed 
as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make 
collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the 
basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values.
–
 loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible 
and of such little value that its continuance on the institution’s books 
as an asset, without establishment of a speciﬁ c valuation allowance or 
charge-off is not warranted.
In the following tables, retail loans are classiﬁ ed as pass except when a 
retail loan rdays past due, it is downgraded to substandard, and 
upon rdays past due, it is downgraded to loss and charged 
off, in accordance with the FFIEC Uniform Retail Credit Classiﬁ cation and 
Account Management Policy.

ORE consists of properties obtained through a foreclosure proceeding or 
through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. In accordance 
with pr310-10-35 regarding subsequent measurement of 
310-40-15 regarding accounting for troubled 
debt restructurings by a creditor, a loan is classiﬁ ed as an in-substance 
foreclosure when Synovus has taken possession of the collateral regardless 
of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place.
At foreclosure, ORE is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the 
estimated cost to sell, which establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, ORE is evaluated quarterly and reported at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell, not to exceed the new cost basis, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates 
of fair value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for 
estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors or recent 
developments such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering 
management’s plans for disposition, which could result in adjustment to 
lower the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of the loan 
balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral, less costs 
to sell, is recorded as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. 
Revenue and expenses from ORE operations as well as gains or losses on 
sales are recorded as foreclosed real estate expense, net, a component 
of non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
Subsequent declines in fair value are recorded on a property-by-property 
basis through use of a valuation allowance within other real estate on 
the consolidated balances sheets and valuation adjustment account in foreclosed real estate expense, net, a component of non-interest expense 
on the consolidated statements of operations.million at

Series A Preferred Stock
2008, Synovus issued to the Trshares 
A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation amount per 
sharA 
Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for 
the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. Synovus may, 
at its option, with the consent of the Federal Reserve Board, redeem, in 
whole or in part, the Series A Preferred Stock at the liquidation amount 
per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series A Preferred 
Stock is generally non-voting. However, if Synovus fails to pay dividends 
on the Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods, 
whether or not consecutive, the number of authorized directors will be 
increased by two and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have 
the right to elect two directors. A consequence of the Series A Preferred 
Stock purchase includes certain restrictions on executive compensation 
that could limit the tax deductibility of compensation that Synovus pays to executive management.As part of its purA Preferred Stock, Synovus issued 
the Treasury a Warrant. The Warrant provides for the adjustment of the 
exercise price and the number of shares of Synovus Common Stock 
issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, 
such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of Synovus Common Stock, and upon certain issuances of 
Synovus Common Stock at or below a speciﬁ ed price relative to the initial 
exercise price. The Warrant expire2018. Pursuant to the 
Securities Purchase Agreement, the Treasury has agreed not to exercise 
voting power with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued upon 

exercise of the Warrant.

The ofeferred Stock and the Warrant were

Synovus has allocated the total proceeds received frStates

Preferred Stock and the Warrants. This allocation resulted in the Series A 
Preferred Stock and the Warrant being initially recorded at amounts that 
are less than their respective fair values at the issuance date.

amortizing notes have been recorded as long-term debt. Issuance costs 
associated with the debt component were recorded as a prepaid expense 
which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the

the fair value was determined by obtaining yields for comparably-rated issuers trading in the market, considering the market yield of existing 
Synovus subordinated debt, the credit rating of Synovus, as well as the 
junior nature of the new debt. The debt component was recorded at fair 
value, and the discount is being amortized using the level yield method The fair value of the equity component was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions:

Synovus is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by 
the federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital 
requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional 
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct 
material effect on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Under capital 
adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective 
action, Synovus must meet speciﬁ c capital levels that involve quantitative 
measures of both on- and off-balance sheet items as calculated under 
regulatory capital guidelines. Capital amounts and classiﬁ cation are also 
subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk 
weightings, and other factors.As a ﬁ nancial holding company, Synovus and its subsidiary bank, Synovus 
Bank, are required to maintain capital levels required for a well-capitalized 
institution as deﬁ ned by federal banking regulations. The capital measures 
used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk-based capital 
ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio. Synovus Bank 
is a state-chartered bank under the regulations of the GA DBF. Under 
applicable regulations, Synovus Bank is well-capitalized if it has a total 
risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or 
greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any written 
agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive 
from a federal and/or state banking regulatory agency to meet and maintain 
a speciﬁ c capital level for any capital measure. However, even if Synovus 
Bank satisﬁ es all applicable quantitative criteria to be considered well-
capitalized, the regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an 
institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other 2010, Synovus Bank entered into a memorandum 
of understanding with the FDIC and the GA DBF agreeing to maintain a 
minimum leverage ratio of 8% and a minimum total risk-based capital 
to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%. Management believes that, as 
2012, Synovus and Synovus Bank meet all capital 
requirements to which they are subject.
Management currently believes, based on current internal capital analyses 
and earnings projections, that Synovus’ capital position is adequate to 
meet current regulatory minimum capital requirements. However, Synovus 
continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry capital 
standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, and 
engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at 
both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with the future repayment of Synovus’ 
obligations under the CPP.

 Fair Value Accounting
Synovus carries various assets and liabilities at fair value based on the fair 825. Fair value is 
deﬁ ned as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability (an “exit price”) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants on the measurement date.
Synovus has implemented controls and processes for the determination 
of the fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments. The ultimate responsibility for the 
determination of fair value rests with Synovus. Synovus has established a 
process that has been designed to ensure there is an independent review 
and validation of fair values by a function independent of those entering into the transaction. This includes speciﬁ c controls to ensure consistent 
pricing policies and procedures that incorporate veriﬁ cation for both market 
and derivative transactions. For all ﬁ nancial instruments where fair values 
are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable 
pricing inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is utilized. Where the market for a ﬁ nancial instrument is not active, fair 
value is determined using a valuation technique or pricing model. These valuation techniques and models involve a degree of estimation, the extent 
of which depends on each instrument’s complexity and the availability of 
market-based data.The most frequently applied pricing model and valuation technique 
utilized by Synovus is the discounted cash ﬂ ow model. Discounted cash 
ﬂ ows determine the value by estimating the expected future cash ﬂ ows 
from assets or liabilities discounted to their present value. Synovus may 
also use a relative value model to determine the fair value of a ﬁ nancial 
instrument based on the market prices of similar assets or liabilities or an option pricing model such as binomial pricing that includes probability-
based techniques. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques 
and models include benchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other 
inputs used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, price volatilities and correlations, prepayment rates, probability of default, and 
loss severity upon default.Synovus reﬁ nes and modiﬁ es its valuation techniques as markets develop 
and as pricing for individual ﬁ nancial instruments become more or less 
readily available. While Synovus believes its valuation techniques are 
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of 
different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates 
of fair value at the balance sheet date. In order to determine the fair value, 
where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the 
pricing information. These adjustments reﬂ ect management’s assessment 
of factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in the pricing 
information. Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, management assesses the 
appropriateness of any model used. To the extent that the price provided by 
internal models does not represent the fair value of the ﬁ nancial instrument, 
management makes adjustments to the model valuation to calibrate it to other available pricing sources. Where unobservable inputs are used, 

management may determine a range of possible valuations based upon differing stress scenarios to determine the sensitivity associated with the 
valuation. As a ﬁ nal step, management considers the need for further 
adjustments to the modeled price to reﬂ ect how market participants would 
price the ﬁ nancial instrument.
Fair Value Hierarchy
Synovus determines the fair value of its ﬁ nancial instruments based on the fair value hierar820-10, 
which requires an entity 
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A ﬁ nancial ins
trument’s categorization 
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is signiﬁ cant to the ﬁ nancial instrument’s fair v
alue measurement in its entirety. 
There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs of the valuation hierarchy 
are deﬁ ned below:
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities for the instrument or security to be valued. assets include marketable equity securities as well as U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded 
in over-
the-counter markets. quoted prices in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all signiﬁ cant assumptions are der
ived principally from or corr
prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined by using 

a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable 

market data. U.S. Government sponsored agency securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored 

enterprises and agencies, obligations of states and municipalities, collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. Governme
nt sponsored enterprises, and mortgage loans held-for-sale are generally included in this category. Certain private equity investm
ents that invest in publicly traded companies are also consider
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
ities include ﬁ nancial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash ﬂ ow models and similar techniques, and 

may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or lia
bility. 
These methods of valuation may result in a signiﬁ cant portion of the fair value being derived from unobservable assumptions th
at reﬂ ect Synovus’ own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. This categ
ory primarily includes collateral-dependent impaired loans, other real estate, certain equity investments, and certain private equi
ty investments.Fair Value Option
Synovus has elected the fair value option for mortgage loans held for 
sale primarily to ease the operational burdens required to maintain hedge 
accounting for these loans. Synovus is still able to achieve effective economic 
hedges on mortgage loans held for sale without the operational time and expense needed to manage a hedge accounting program.
Valuation Methodology by Product
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the 
major categories of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
112PAR 
Trading Account Assets and Investment 
Securities Available-for-Sale
The fair values of trading securities and investment securities available for sale are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based 
on either quoted market prices or observed transactions. Management employs independent third-party pricing services to provide fair value 
estimates for Synovus’ investment securities available for sale and trading securities. Fair values for ﬁ xed income investment securities are typically 
determined based upon quoted market prices, broker/dealer quotations 
for identical or similar securities, and/or inputs that are observable in the 
market, either directly or indirectly, for substantially similar securities. 
1 securities are typically exchange quoted prices and include ﬁ nancial 
instruments such as U.S. Tr2 
securities are typically matrix priced by the third-party pricing service to 
calculate the fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable 
data such as relevant broker/dealer quotes, market spreads, cash ﬂ ows, 
yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and the respective terms and 
conditions for debt instruments. The types of securities classiﬁ ed as 
2 within the valuation hierarchy primarily consist of collateralized 
mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities, debt securities of 
U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises and agencies, corporate debt, 
and state and municipal securities.When there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, 
Synovus develops valuations based on assumptions that are not readily 
observable in the marketplace; these securities are classiﬁ 3 within 
the valuation hierarchy3 investment 
securities available for sale consists of trust preferred securities issued by 
ﬁ nancial institutions. Synovus also carries non-marketable common equity 
securities within this category. Synovus accounts for the non-marketable 
common equity securities in accor325-20, which requires 
To determine the fair value of the 
trust preferred securities, management uses a measurement technique to 
reﬂ ect one that utilizes credit spreads and/or credit indices available from 
a third-party pricing service. In addition, for each trust preferred security, 
management projects non-credit adjusted cash ﬂ ows, and discounts those 
cash ﬂ ows to net present value incorporating a relevant credit spread in 
the discount rate. Other inputs to calculating fair value include potential discounts for lack of marketability.
Management uses various validation procedures to conﬁ rm the prices 
received from pricing services and quotations received from dealers are 
reasonable. Such validation procedures include reference to relevant 
broker/dealer quotes or other market quotes and a review of valuations 
and trade activity of comparable securities. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or ﬁ rm) and the relationship of recently 
evidenced market activity to the prices provided by the third-party pricing 
service. Further, management also employs the services of an additional 
independent pricing ﬁ rm as a means to verify and conﬁ rm the fair values 

of the primary independent pricing ﬁ rms.
Mortgage Loans Held for SaleSynovus elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell to investors. When quoted market prices are not 
available, fair value is derived from a hypothetical bulk sale model used to 
estimate the exit price of the loans in a loan sale. The bid pricing convention 
is used for loan pricing for similar assets. The valuation model is based upon forward settlements of a pool of loans of identical coupon, maturity, 
product, and credit attributes. The inputs to the model are continuously 
updated with available market and historical data. As the loans are 
sold in the secondary market and predominantly used as collateral for 
securitizations, the valuation model represents the highest and best use 
of the loans in Synovus’ principal market. Mortgage loans held for sale are classiﬁ chy.
Private Equity InvestmentsPrivate equity investments consist primarily of equity method investments in venture capital funds, which are primarily classiﬁ 3 within the 
valuation hierarchy. The valuation of these investments requires signiﬁ cant 
management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, 
inherent lack of liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Based 
on these factors, the ultimate realizable value of these investments could 
differ signiﬁ cantly from the value reﬂ ected in the accompanying consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. For ownership in publicly traded companies held in 

the funds, valuation is based on the closing market price at the balance sheet date, and the valuation of marketable securities that have market restrictions is discounted until the securities can be freely traded. The 
private equity investments in which Synovus holds a limited partner interest 
consist of funds that invest in privately held companies. For privately 
held companies in the funds, the general partner estimates the fair value of the company in accordance with GAAP as clariﬁ 820 and 
guidance speciﬁ c to investment companies. The estimated fair value of 
the company is the estimated fair value as an exit price the fund would receive if it were to sell the company in the marketplace. The fair value of 
the fund’s underlying investments is estimated through the use of valuation 
models such as option pricing or a discounted cash ﬂ ow model. Valuation 
factors, such as a company’s operational performance against budget 
or milestones, last price paid by investors, with consideration given on whether ﬁ nancing is provided by insiders or unrelated new investors, 
public market comparables, liquidity of the market, industry and economic trends, and change of management or key personnel, are used in the 
determination of fair value.Also, Synovus holds an interest in an investment fund that invests in 
publicly traded ﬁ nancial services companies. Although the fund holds 
investments in publicly traded entities, the fair value of this investment is classiﬁ 2 in the valuation hierarchy because there is no actively 
traded market for the fund itself, and the value of the investment is based 
on the aggregate fair value of the publicly traded companies that are held 
in the fund for investment.Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts
The investments held in Rabbi Trusts primarily include mutual funds that 
invest in equity and ﬁ xed income securities. Shares of mutual funds are 
valued based on quoted market prices, and are therefore classiﬁ ed within 
chy.
Salary Stock UnitsSalary stock units represent the distribution of fully vested stock awards 
as a part of base salary to certain key employees of Synovus. The salary stock units are classiﬁ ed as liabilities and are settled in cash, as determined 
by the closing Common Stock price on the date of settlement and the number of salary stock units being settled. Accordingly, salary stock units 
are classiﬁ chy.

Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesAs part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus utilizes 
derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of interest 
rate risk. With the exception of one derivative contract discussed herein, 
Synovus’ derivative ﬁ nancial instruments ar2 ﬁ nancial instruments. 
The majority of derivatives entered into by Synovus are executed over-the-
counter and consist of interest rate swaps. The fair values of these derivative 
instruments are determined based on an internally developed model that 
uses readily observable market data, as quoted market prices are not 
available for these instruments. The valuation models and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument, and 
include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or 
pricing curves, volatility factors, and customer credit related adjustments. 
The principal techniques used to model the value of these instruments are 
an income approach, discounted cash ﬂ ows, Black-Scholes or binomial 
pricing models. The sale of TBA mortgage-backed securities for current 
month delivery or in the future and the purchase of option contracts of 
similar duration are derivatives utilized by Synovus’ mortgage banking 
subsidiary, and are valued by obtaining prices directly from dealers in 
the form of quotes for identical securities or options using a bid pricing convention with a spread between bid and offer quotations. Interest rate 
swaps, ﬂ oors, caps and collars, and TBA mortgage-backed securities 
are classiﬁ chy.
Synovus’ mortgage banking subsidiary enters into interest rate lock 
commitments related to expected funding of residential mortgage loans at 
speciﬁ ed times in the future. Interest rate lock commitments that relate to 

the origination of mortgage loans that will be held-for-sale are considered 
derivative instruments under applicable accounting guidance. As such, Synovus records its interest rate lock commitments and forward loan 
sales commitments at fair value, determined as the amount that would be required to settle each of these derivative ﬁ nancial instruments at the balance 
sheet date. In the normal course of business, the mortgage subsidiary 
enters into contractual interest rate lock commitments to extend credit, 
if approved, at a ﬁ xed interest rate and with ﬁ xed expiration dates. The 
commitments become effective when the borrowers “lock-in” a speciﬁ ed 
interest rate within the time frames established by the mortgage banking 
subsidiary. Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between 
the time of the interest rate lock by the borrower and the sale date of the 
loan to an investor. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent 
in providing interest rate lock commitments to borrowers, the mortgage 
banking subsidiary enters into best efforts forward sales contracts with 
third party investors. The forward sales contracts lock in a price for the 
sale of loans similar to the speciﬁ c interest rate lock commitments. Both 
the interest rate lock commitments to the borrowers and the forward sales 
contracts to the investors that extend through to the date the loan may 
close are derivatives, and accordingly, are marked to fair value through 
earnings. In estimating the fair value of an interest rate lock commitment, 
Synovus assigns a probability to the interest rate lock commitment based 
on an expectation that it will be exercised and the loan will be funded. 
The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is derived from the fair 
value of related mortgage loans, which is based on observable market 
data and includes the expected net future cash ﬂ ows related to servicing 
of the loans. The fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is also 
derived from inputs that include guarantee fees negotiated with the 
agencies and private investors, buy-up and buy-down values provided 
by the agencies and private investors, and interest rate spreads for the 
difference between retail and wholesale mortgage rates. Management also 
applies fall-out ratio assumptions for those interest rate lock commitments 
for which we do not close a mortgage loan. The fall-out ratio assumptions are based on the mortgage subsidiary’s historical experience, conversion 
ratios for similar loan commitments, and market conditions. While fall-out tendencies are not exact predictions of which loans will or will not close, 
historical performance review of loan-level data provides the basis for 
determining the appropriate hedge ratios. In addition, on a periodic basis, 
the mortgage banking subsidiary performs analysis of actual rate lock fall-out experience to determine the sensitivity of the mortgage pipeline to interest rate changes from the date of the commitment through loan 
origination, and then period end, using applicable published mortgage-backed investment security prices. The expected fall-out ratios (or conversely 
the “pull-through” percentages) are applied to the determined fair value 
of the unclosed mortgage pipeline in accordance with GAAP. Changes 
to the fair value of interest rate lock commitments are recognized based 
on interest rate changes, changes in the probability that the commitment 
will be exercised, and the passage of time. The fair value of the forward 
sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date. These instruments are deﬁ chy.
2009, Synovus sold certain Visa Class B shares to another 
Visa USA member ﬁ nancial institution. The sales price was based on the 
Visa stock conversion ratio in effect at the time for conversion of Visa 
Class B shares to Visa Class A unrestricted shares at a future date. In 
conjunction with the sale, Synovus entered into a derivative contract with 
the purchaser (the Visa derivative), which provides for settlements between 
the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of Visa Class 
B shares to Visa Class A shares. The fair value of the Visa derivative is 
measured using an internal model that includes the use of probability 
weighted scenarios for estimates of Visa’s aggregate exposure to Covered 
Litigation matters, with consideration of amounts funded by Visa into its 
escrow account for the Covered Litigation matters. The internal model 
also includes estimated future fees payable to the derivative counterparty. 
Since this estimation process requires application of judgment in developing 
signiﬁ cant unobservable inputs used to determine the possible outcomes 
and the probability weighting assigned to each scenario, this derivative 
has been classiﬁ 3 within the valuation hierarchy–

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
From time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a non-
recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically are 
a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a 
write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered to 
be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. The following table presents assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as 

of the dates indicated for which there was a fair value adjustment during 
the period, according to the valuation hierar820-10.

(1) Impaired loans that are collateral-dependent.
Collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated for impairment in 
accordance with the pr310-10-35 using the fair value of 
the collateral less costs to sell. For loans measured using the estimated 
fair value of collateral securing these loans less costs to sell, fair value is generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certiﬁ ed or 
licensed appraiser using inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates, and market comparables, adjusted for estimated selling costs. 
Management also considers other factors or recent developments, 
such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time 
of valuation, and anticipated sales values considering management’s 
plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments to the collateral 
value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Estimated costs to sell are 
based on actual amounts for similar assets. These measurements are 
classiﬁ 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Collateral dependent 
impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis 
for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly based on the same 
factors identiﬁ ed above.
Loans are transferred to other loans held for sale at fair value when 
Synovus makes the determination to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans. The 
fair value of the loans is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of the loan and the anticipated market prices of similar assets 
less estimated costs to sell, as well as consideration of the market for loan sales versus the sale of collateral. At the time of transfer, if the fair 
value is less than the carrying amount, the difference is recorded as a 
charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. Decreases in the fair 
value subsequent to the transfer, as well as gains/losses realized from 
sale of these loans, are recognized as gains/losses on other loans held for 
sale, net, as a component of non-interest expense on the consolidated 
statements of operations.ORE consists of properties obtained through a foreclosure proceeding or 
through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. The fair value 
of ORE is determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, 
and other estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent 
sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At foreclosure, ORE is 
recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the estimated cost to sell, 
which establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, ORE is 
evaluated quarterly and reported at fair value less estimated costs to sell, 
not to exceed the new cost basis, determined on the basis of current 
appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling 
costs. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated quarterly and 
assets are marked to the lower of fair value less estimated selling costs 
and current fair value, but not to exceed the cost. In the determination of 
fair value subsequent to foreclosure, management also considers other 
factors or recent developments, such as changes in absorption rates or 
market conditions from the time of valuation, and anticipated sales values 
considering management’s plans for disposition, which could result in 
adjustment to lower the fair value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Internally adjusted valuations are consider3 measurements as 
management uses assumptions that may not be observable in the market.Other assets held for sale consist of certain premises and equipment held 
for sale, including those related to the efﬁ ciency initiatives discussed in 
3, Restructuring Charges, herein. These assets are classiﬁ ed as held 
for sale and recorded at the lower of their amortized cost or fair value, less 
360-10. The fair value of these assets is 
determined primarily on the basis of appraisals or BOV, as circumstances 
warrant, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Both techniques engage licensed or certiﬁ ed professionals that use inputs such as absorption 
rates, capitalization rates, and market comparables; these valuations are 
consider3 measurements since assumptions or inputs may not

Inputs Measured on a Recurring Basis
Included in the fair value estimates of ﬁ nancial instruments carried at fair 
value on the consolidated balance sheet are those estimated in full or in part 
using valuation techniques based on assumptions that are not supported 
by observable market prices, rates, or other inputs. Unobservable inputs are assessed carefully, considering the current economic environment and 
market conditions. However, by their very nature, unobservable inputs 
imply a degree of uncertainty in their determination, because they are 
supported by little, if any, market activity for the related asset or liability.
Investment Securities Available for Sale
The signiﬁ cant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of 
3 assets are the credit spread embedded 
in the discount rate and the discount for lack of marketability. Generally, a 
change in one or more assumptions, and the degree or sensitivity of the 
change used, can have a meaningful impact on fair value. With regard to 
the trust preferr3 assets, raising the credit spread, 
and raising the discount for lack of marketability assumptions will result 
in a lower fair value measurement.
Private Equity InvestmentsIn the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity, and the 
long-term nature of private equity investments, signiﬁ cant judgment is 
required to value these investments. The signiﬁ cant unobservable inputs 
used in the fair value measurement of private equity investments include 
current operations, ﬁ nancial condition, and cash ﬂ ows, comparables and 
private sales, when available; and recently executed ﬁ nancing transactions 
related to investee companies. Signiﬁ cant increases or decreases in any 
of these inputs in isolation would result in a signiﬁ cantly lower or higher 
fair value measurement.
Visa Derivative Liability
The fair value of the Visa derivative liability is measured using a probability 
model, which utilizes probability weighted scenarios for estimates of Visa’s 
aggregate exposure (from which the Company’s exposure is derived) to 
Covered Litigation matters, which include consideration of amounts funded 
by Visa into its escrow account for the Covered Litigation matters, Visa’s 
disclosures about the Covered Litigation, and estimated future monthly fees 
payable to the derivative counterparty. Signiﬁ cant increases (decreases) in 
any of these inputs in isolation would result in a signiﬁ cantly higher (lower) 
valuation of the Visa derivative liability. Generally, a change in the amount 
funded by Visa into its escrow for the Covered Litigation would have a 
directionally similar change in the assumptions used for the discounted 
cash ﬂ ow technique used to compute fair value.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following table presents the carrying and fair values of ﬁ nancial 
2012 and 2011. The fair value represents 
management’s best estimates based on a range of methodologies and 
assumptions. For ﬁ nancial instruments that are not recorded at fair value 
on the balance sheet, such as loans, interest bearing deposits (including 
brokered deposits), and long-term debt, the ﬁ gures given in the notes 
should not be taken as an estimate of the amount that would be realized 
if all such ﬁ nancial instruments were to be settled immediately.
Cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing funds with the Federal 
Reserve Bank, interest earning deposits with banks, and federal funds 
sold and securities purchased under resale agreements are repriced on 
a short-term basis; as such, the carrying value closely approximates fair 

value. Since these amounts generally relate to highly liquid assets, these 

are considerement.
Loans, net of deferred fees and costs, are recorded at the amount of funds 
advanced, less charge-offs and an estimation of credit risk represented 
by the allowance for loan losses. The fair value estimates for disclosure 
purposes differentiate loans based on their ﬁ nancial characteristics, such 
as product classiﬁ cation, loan category, pricing features, and remaining 
maturity. The fair value of loans is estimated for portfolios of loans with 
similar ﬁ nancial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as 
commercial, mortgage, home equity, credit card, and other consumer 
loans. Commercial loans are further segmented into certain collateral 
code groupings. The fair value of the loan portfolio is calculated by 
discounting estimated future cash ﬂ ows using current origination rates for 
loans with similar terms. An incremental discount equal to the allowance 
for loan losses is subtracted from the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows to reﬂ ect the estimated credit risk discount. This method of 
estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair 
value pr820-10 and generally produces a higher value 
than a pure exit price approach. For loans measured using the estimated 
fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair value is generally estimated using appraisals of the collateral. Collateral values are monitored and 
additional write-downs are recognized if it is determined that the estimated 
collateral values have declined further. Estimated costs to sell are based 
on current amounts of disposal costs for similar assets. Carrying value 
is considered to reﬂ ect fair value for these loans. Loans are considered a 
ement.
The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest 
bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand deposits, money 
market accounts, and savings accounts, is estimated to be equal to the amount payable on demand as of that respective date. The fair value of 
time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash ﬂ ows. 
The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits 
of similar remaining maturities. The value of long-term relationships with 
depositors is not taken into account in estimating fair values. Synovus has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit 
base and, in the opinion of management, these customer relationships 
add signiﬁ cant value to Synovus. Synovus has determined that the

reasonably measure all inputs to valuation based on observable market 
variables. Short-term and long-term debt is also consider2 
valuation, as management relies on market prices for bonds or debt that 
is similar, but not necessarily identical, to the debt being valued. Short-
term debt that matures within ten days is assumed to be at fair value, and 
is consider1 measurement. The fair value of other short-term 

and long-term debt with ﬁ xed interest rates is calculated by discounting

 Derivative Instruments
As part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus 
utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types 
of interest rate risk. These derivative instruments generally consist of 
interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments made to prospective 
mortgage loan customers, and commitments to sell ﬁ xed-rate mortgage 
loans. Interest rate lock commitments represent derivative instruments 
since it is intended that such loans will be sold.From time to time, Synovus utilizes interest rate swaps to manage interest 
rate risks primarily arising from its core banking activities. These interest 
rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating 
interest rate payment obligations without the exchange of underlying 
principal amounts. Swaps may be designated as either cash ﬂ ow hedges 
or fair value hedges, as discussed below2012 and 
2011, Synovus had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts utilized 
to manage interest rate risk.
SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.
121PAR 
Cash Flow HedgesSynovus designates hedges of ﬂ oating rate loans as cash ﬂ ow hedges. 
These swaps hedge against the variability of cash ﬂ ows from speciﬁ ed pools 
of ﬂ oating rate prime based loans. Synovus calculates effectiveness of the 
hedging relationship quarterly using regression analysis. The effective portion 
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component 
of other comprehensive income and reclassiﬁ ed into earnings in the same 
period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 
Ineffectiveness from cash ﬂ ow hedges is recognized in the consolidated 

statements of operations as a component of other non-interest income. 
2012, there were no cash ﬂ ow hedges outstanding, 
and therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
Synovus expects to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) $(447) thousand to pre-tax income during the next year as 
amortization of deferred gains (losses) are recorded.
Synovus did not terminate any cash ﬂ ow hedges during 2012 or 2011. The 
remaining unamortized deferred loss balance of all previously terminated 
cash ﬂ million and 
$630 thousand, respectively.
Fair Value Hedges
Synovus designates hedges of ﬁ xed rate liabilities as fair value hedges. 
These swaps hedge against the change in fair value of various ﬁ xed 
rate liabilities due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, LIBOR. 
Synovus calculates effectiveness of the fair value hedges quarterly using 

regr2012 and 2011, there were no 
fair value hedges outstanding, and therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness. 
Ineffectiveness from fair value hedges is recognized in the consolidated 
statements of operations as a component of other non-interest income.
Synovus did not terminate any fair value hedges during 2012 or 2011. The 
remaining unamortized deferred gain balance on all previously terminated 
million and 
espectively.
Customer Related Derivative PositionsSynovus also enters into derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to meet the 
ﬁ nancing and interest rate risk management needs of its customers. Upon 
entering into these instruments to meet customer needs, Synovus enters into offsetting positions in order to minimize the interest rate risk. These 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recorded at fair value with any resulting 
gain or loss recorded in current period ear2012, 
the notional amount of customer related interest rate derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments, including both the customer position and the offsetting 
espectively.
Visa Derivative
In conjunction with the sale of Class B shares of common stock issued by 
Visa to Synovus as a Visa USA member, Synovus entered into a derivative 
contract with the purchaser, which provides for settlements between the 
parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of Visa Class B 
shares to Visa Class A shares. The conversion ratio changes when Visa 
deposits funds to a litigation escrow established by Visa to pay settlements 
for certain litigation, which Visa is indemniﬁ ed by Visa USA members. The 
litigation escrow is funded by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of Class 
B shares. The fair value of the derivative liability is based on an estimate 
of Synovus’ membership proportion of Visa’s aggregate exposure to 
the Covered Litigation, or in effect, the future cumulative deposits to the 
litigation escrow for settlement of the Covered Litigation, and estimated 
future monthly fees payable to the derivative counterparty– 
– Visa 
Shares and Related Agreement” of this Report for further information.
Mortgage DerivativesSynovus originates ﬁ rst lien residential mortgage loans for sale into the 
secondary market and generally does not hold the originated loans for investment purposes. Mortgage loans are sold by Synovus for conversion 
to securities and the servicing of these loans is generally sold to a third-
party servicing aggregator, or Synovus sells the mortgage loans as whole 
loans to investors either individually or in bulk on a servicing released basis.
2012 and 2011, Synovus had agreements to fund at 
a locked interest rate, primarily ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans to customers 
million, respectively. The 
2012 and 
2011, resulted in an unrmillion, 
respectively, which was recorded as a component of mortgage banking 

income in the consolidated statements of operations.2012 and 2011, outstanding commitments to sell primarily 
ﬁ million, 
respectively. Such commitments are entered into to reduce the exposure 
to market risk arising from potential changes in interest rates, which could 
affect the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and outstanding rate 
lock commitments, which guarantee a certain interest rate if the loan is 
ultimately funded or granted by the Bank as a mortgage loan held for 
sale. The commitments to sell mortgage loans are at ﬁ xed prices and 
are scheduled to settle at speciﬁ ed dates that generally do not exceed 
days. The fair value of outstanding commitments to sell mortgage 
2012 and 2011 resulted in an unrealized loss of 
million, respectively, which was recorded as a 
component of mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations.Counterparty Credit Risk and Collateral
Entering into derivative contracts potentially exposes Synovus to the risk 
of counterparties’ failure to fulﬁ ll their legal obligations, including, but not 
limited to, potential amounts due or payable under each derivative contract. 
Notional principal amounts are often used to express the volume of these 
transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much 
smaller. Synovus assesses the credit risk of its dealer counterparties by 
regularly monitoring publicly available credit rating information and other 
market indicators. Dealer collateral requirements are determined via risk-
based policies and procedures and in accordance with existing agreements. 
Synovus seeks to minimize dealer credit risk by dealing with highly rated 
counterparties and by obtaining collateral for exposures above certain 
predetermined limits. Management closely monitors credit conditions within 
the customer swap portfolio, which management deems to be of higher risk than dealer counterparties. Collateral is secured at origination and 
credit related fair value adjustments are recorded against the asset value 
of the derivative as deemed necessary based upon an analysis, which includes consideration of the current asset value of the swap, customer 
credit rating, collateral value, and customer standing with regards to its 
swap contractual obligations and other related matters. Such asset values 
ﬂ uctuate based upon changes in interest rates regardless of changes in 

notional amounts and changes in customer speciﬁ c risk.
Collateral ContingenciesCertain derivative instruments contain provisions that require Synovus to 
maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit 
rating agencies. When Synovus’ credit rating falls below investment grade, 
these provisions allow the counterparties of the derivative instrument to 
demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments 
in net liability positions and, for certain counterparties, request immediate 
termination. As Synovus’ current rating is below investment grade, Synovus 
is required to post collateral, as required by each agreement, against these 
million, 
consisting of cash and short-term investments, has been pledged to the derivative counterparties to comply with collateral requirements.

primary beneﬁ ciary and required to consolidate a VIE if it has a variable 
interest in the VIE that provides it with a controlling ﬁ nancial interest. 
For such purposes, the determination of whether a controlling ﬁ nancial 
interest exists is based on whether a single party has both the power 
to direct the activities of the VIE that most signiﬁ cantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of the 
VIE or the right to receive beneﬁ ts from the VIE that could potentially be

VIEs for which it is deemed the primary beneﬁ ciary.
Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
Rabbi T– 
Synovus has established certain rabbi trusts related 
to deferred compensation plans offered to its employees. Synovus 
contributes employee cash compensation deferrals to the trusts and 
directs the underlying investments made by the trusts. The assets of 
these trusts are available to creditors of Synovus only in the event that 
Synovus becomes insolvent. These trusts are considered VIEs because 
either there is no equity at risk in the trusts or because Synovus provided 
the equity interest to its employees in exchange for services rendered. 
Synovus is considered the primary beneﬁ ciary of the rabbi trusts as it 
has the ability to direct the underlying investments made by the trusts,

Synovus provides construction lending for certain of the LIHTC partnerships

of its equity investment plus the outstanding amount of any construction loans in excess of the fair value of the collateral for the loan but has no obligation to fund the operations or working capital of the partnerships. The general partners of these partnerships are considered the primary

For certain troubled commercial loans, 
Synovus restructures the terms of the borrower’s debt in an effort to increase 
the probability of receipt of amounts contractually due. A troubled debt 
restructuring generally requires consideration of whether the borrowing 
entity is a VIE as economic events have proven that the entity’s equity is not 
sufﬁ cient to permit it to ﬁ nance its activities without additional subordinated 
ﬁ nancial support or a restructuring of the terms of its ﬁ nancing. As Synovus 
does not have the power to direct the activities that most signiﬁ cantly impact 
such troubled commercial borrowers’ operations, it is not considered 
the primary beneﬁ ciary, even in situations where, based on the size of 
the ﬁ nancing provided, Synovus is exposed to potentially signiﬁ cant 
beneﬁ ts and losses of the borrowing entity. Synovus has no contractual 
requirements to provide ﬁ nancial support to the borrowing entities beyond 
certain funding commitments established upon restructuring of the terms 
of the debt that allows for preparation of the underlying collateral for sale 
and the borrowing entity is considered a VIE.

 Visa Shares and Related Agreement
Synovus is a member of the Visa USA network and received shares of Visa 
Class B common stock in exchange for its membership interest in Visa USA 
in conjunction with the public offering by the Visa IPO in 2008. Visa members 
have indemniﬁ cation obligations with respect to the Covered Litigation. Visa 
Class B shares are subject to certain restrictions until Mar2011 or 
settlement of the Cover2012, all of the 
Covered Litigation had not been settled. Visa has established a litigation 
escrow to fund settlement of the Covered Litigation. The litigation escrow 
is funded by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of Class B shares.
The Visa IPO was completed in Mar2008. Immediately following 
completion of the Visa IPO in Mar2008, Visa redeemed a portion of 
the Class B shares of its common stock held by Visa members. Synovus 
recognized a prmillion on redemption of a portion 
of its Visa Class B shares. During 2008 and 2009, Synovus reduced its 
contingent liability for its indemniﬁ cation obligation upon events of Visa’s 
funding of the litigation escrow through conversion of Class B shares as 

described above.2009, Synovus sold its remaining Visa Class B shares to another 
Visa USA member ﬁ million and recognized a 
million. In conjunction with the sale, Synovus entered 
into a derivative contract with the purchaser which provides for settlements 
between the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of Visa Class B shares to Visa Class A shares. The fair value of the derivative 
2012 and 2011, 
respectively, is based on an estimate of Visa’s exposure to liability based 
upon probability-weighted potential outcomes of the Covered Litigation, 
and with re2012 includes the present value of 
estimated future fees paid to the derivative counterparty, and the estimated 
impact of a ten bps decrease in credit interchange fees for an eight-month 
period beginning in mid-2013.Synovus paid settlements of apprmillion and $888 thousand 
to the derivative counterparty in connection with conversion rate changes 2012, respectively. The conversion rate 
changed each of these times in connection with Visa’s deposit of funds 
to the litigation escrow2012, the 
million indemniﬁ million increase in 
the fair value of the derivative liability and $466 thousand of fees payable 
to the derivative counterparty.
2012, Visa announced that it had signed a memorandum 
of understanding with the class plaintiffs in the multi-district interchange 
litigation, which obligated the parties to enter into a settlement agreement, 
2012, Visa announced that a settlement agreement had 
been executed to resolve class plaintiff’s claims. Among other things, the 
settlement agreement provides for settlement payments of approximately 
billion, of which Visa’s share will be apprbillion, and 
further provides for distribution to class merchants of an amount equal 
to ten basis points of default interchange across all credit rate categories 
for a period of eight consecutive months, which otherwise would have 
been paid to card issuers and which effectively reduces credit interchange 
for that period of time. The eight month period would begin sixty days after completion of the court ordered period during which individual class 
members may opt out of the proposed settlement.
These announcements have been factored into the fair value determination 
2012 using the pr– 
Fair Value Accounting. Management believes that the estimate of Synovus’ 
exposure to the Visa indemniﬁ cation and fees associated with the Visa 
Derivative is adequate based on current information, including Visa’s recent 
announcements. However, future developments in the litigation could 
require potentially signiﬁ cant changes to Synovus’ estimate.
 Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, Synovus enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments and letters of credit to meet the 
ﬁ nancing needs of its customers. Synovus uses the same credit policies in 
making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance 
sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend 
to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established 
in the contract. Commitments generally have ﬁ xed expiration dates or 
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
The contractual amount of these ﬁ nancial instruments represents Synovus’ 
maximum credit risk should the counterparty draw upon the commitment, 
and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to 
the terms of the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected 
to expire without being drawn upon, total commitment amounts do not 
necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The carrying amount of loan commitments and letters of credit closely 
approximates the fair value of such ﬁ nancial instruments. Carrying amounts 
include unamortized fee income and, in some instances, allowances for any 
estimated credit losses from these ﬁ nancial instruments. These amounts 
are not material to Synovus’ consolidated balance sheets.

Repurchase Obligations for Mortgage Loans 
Originated for SaleSubstantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without 
recourse, or continuing involvement (Synovus Mortgage does not retain the 
servicing rights). These loans are originated and underwritten internally by 
Synovus personnel and are primarily to borrowers in Synovus’ geographic 
market footprint. These sales are typically effected as non-recourse loan 
sales to GSEs and non-GSE purchasers.
Each GSE and non-GSE purchaser has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria 
for sellers of loans, and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal 

amount of the loans sold is generally transferred to the purchasers upon 
sale. The purchase agreements require Synovus Mortgage to make certain 
representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufﬁ ciency of 
ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third 
parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these representations or 
warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the 
loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the 
purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of the loan.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2012, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans.

loans previously sold, including amounts accrued in accordance with 
million for the years

accrued liability related to mortgage repurmillion

Mortgage Loan Foreclosure Practices
billion 
billion, respectively of home equity and consumer mortgage 
loans which are secured by ﬁ rst and second liens on residential properties. 
Of this amount, apprmillion, respectively, 
consists of mortgages relating to properties in Florida and South Carolina 
which are states in which foreclosures proceed through the courts. To 
date, foreclosure activity in the home equity and consumer mortgage loan 
portfolio has been low. Any foreclosures on these loans are handled by 
designated Synovus personnel and external legal counsel, as appropriate, 
following established policies regarding legal and regulatory requirements. 
Based on information currently available, management believes that it does

Synovus carefully examines and considers each legal matter, and, in those 
situations where Synovus determines that a particular legal matter presents 
loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, 
Synovus establishes an appropriate accrual. An event is considered to be 
“probable” if “the future event is likely to occur.” The actual amounts accrued 
by Synovus in r2012 are not 
material to Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. The actual costs of 
resolving legal claims may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued.
In addition, where Synovus determines that there is a reasonable possibility 
of a loss in respect of legal matters, including those legal matters described 
below, Synovus considers whether it is able to estimate the total reasonably 
possible loss or range of loss. An event is “reasonably possible” if “the 
chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less 
than likely.” An event is “remote” if “the chance of the event or future event 
occurring is more than slight but less than reasonably possible.” In many 
situations, Synovus may be unable to estimate reasonably possible losses 
due to the preliminary nature of the legal matters, as well as a variety of other 
factors and uncertainties. For those legal matters where Synovus is able 
to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, Synovus’ management 
currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is 

from zermillion in excess of amounts accrued, if any, related to 
those matters. This estimated aggregate range is based upon information 
currently available to Synovus, and the actual losses could prove to be 
higher. As there are further developments in these legal matters, Synovus 
will reassess these matters, and the estimated range of reasonably possible 
losses may change as a result of this assessment. Based on Synovus’ 
current knowledge and advice of counsel, management presently does not 
believe that the liabilities arising from these legal matters will have a material 
adverse effect on Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial condition, operating 
results or cash ﬂ ows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution 
of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on Synovus’ 
results of operations and ﬁ nancial condition for any particular period.
Synovus intends to vigorously pursue all available defenses to these legal 
matters, but will also consider other alternatives, including settlement, in 

situations where there is an opportunity to resolve such legal matters on 
terms that Synovus considers to be favorable, including in light of the 
continued expense and distraction of defending such legal matters. Synovus 
also maintains insurance coverage, which may (or may not) be available to SYNOVUS FINANCIAL CORP.

 Employment Expenses and Beneﬁ
 t Plans2012 Synovus had three separate non-contributory 
retirement and beneﬁ t plans consisting of money purchase pension, proﬁ t 
sharing, and 401(k) plans which cover all eligible employees. Annual 
discretionary contributions to these plans are set each year by the Boards of 
Directors but cannot exceed amounts allowable as a deduction for federal 
2012, Synovus 
will make an aggregate contribution for eligible employees to the money 
purchase pension plan of 3.0% of eligible compensation. Synovus made 
an aggregate contribution for eligible employees to the money purchase 
2011 and 3.0% 
2010. The expense recorded for the 
2011, and 2010 was approximately 
million, respectively. For the years 
2011, and 2010, Synovus did not make 
contributions to the proﬁ t sharing and 401(k) plans.
Synovus has stock purchase plans for directors and employees whereby 
Synovus has historically made contributions equal to one-half of employee 
and director voluntary contributions, subject to certain maximum contribution 
limitations. The funds are used to purchase outstanding shares of Synovus 
Common Stock. Synovus recormillion, 
2011, and 2010, 
respectively.
Ef2013, Synovus made changes to the above mentioned 
plans by providing a 100% match on the ﬁ rst 4% of eligible employee 
401(k) contributions, reducing the stock purchase plan match from 50% 
to 15% for every $1 of team member investment according to the years 

of service schedule, and freezing the money purchase pension plan.
Synovus has entered into salary continuation agreements with certain 
employees for past and future services which provide for current 
compensation in addition to salary in the form of deferred compensation 
payable at retirement or in the event of death, total disability, or termination 
of employment. The aggregate cost of these salary continuation plans 
and associated agreements is not material to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.2010, management amended the Synovus Retiree Medical 
Plan (the Retiree Medical Plan or the Plan). Under the provisions of the 
Retiree Medical Plan, employees who terminated employment after 
becoming eligible for early retirement (attaining age 50 with 15 or more 
years of service) could elect medical coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents. This coverage may continue until the former employee 
(or his spouse) reaches age 65 or cover eligible dependents in accordance 
with the Plan’s provision. Per the amendment, Synovus eliminated the 
post-retirement medical plan coverage for all employees who retired on 
or after Mar2011. Participants who were already receiving beneﬁ ts 
under the Retiree Medical Plan will continue to receive beneﬁ ts under the 
2012, the Retiree Medical Plan had 93 participants.
The amendment to the Retiree Medical Plan noted above was considered 
715 because it eliminated the accrual of 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts for all of the future services of a signiﬁ cant number of active 
employees. At the time of the Plan amendment, Synovus estimated the number of eligible participants that would elect coverage by the speciﬁ ed 
deadline of Marmillion curtailment 
gain that was recognized during 2010. Based on the actual number of 
retirees who elected medical coverage for themselves and/or their eligible

 Share-based Compensation
General Description of Share-based Plans
Synovus has a long-term incentive plan under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to grant share-based 
awar2012, Synovus had a 
shares of its authorized but unissued Common Stock 
reserved for future grants under the 2007 Omnibus Plan. The Plan permits 
grants of share-based compensation including stock options, non-vested 
shares, and restricted share units. The grants generally include vesting 
periods ranging from two to ﬁ ve years and contractual terms of ten years. 
Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the fair market 
value of a share of common stock on the grant-date. Non-vested shares 
and restricted share units are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon 
their grant. Synovus has historically issued new shares to satisfy share 
option exercises and share unit conversions. Dividend equivalents are paid 
on outstanding restricted share units in the form of additional restricted 
share units that vest over the same vesting period or the vesting period 
left on the original restricted share unit grant.
During 2012, Synovus awarded an aggregate amount of 3,330,293 restricted 
share units to key employees and non-employee directors. The majority 

of the awards contain a service-based vesting period of three years with 
some awards vesting at the end of three years and some awards vesting 
one-third of the total grant amount on each anniversary of the grant-date 
over the three year period. The weighted average grant-date fair value of

the awarded restricted share units in 2012 was $2.07 per share. During 
2012, Synovus also granted 4,586,666 stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $2.05 and a service-based vesting period of 
three years to key employees throughout the Synovus organization. The 
stock options granted during 2012 vest over a three-year period, with 
one-third of the total grant amount vesting on each anniversary of the 
grant-date. During 2011, Synovus granted 3,815,942 restricted share 
units to key employees throughout the Synovus organization. The majority 
of the awards contain a service-based vesting period of two years. The 
weighted average grant-date fair value of the awarded restricted share units 
in 2011 was $2.65 per share. During 2010, Synovus granted 3,442,586 
stock options with an exercise price of $2.80 to key employees across 
the Synovus organization. These stock options have a three year vesting 
schedule with one-half of the total grant vesting after two years of service and the remaining one-half vesting after three years of service. During 2010, 
Synovus also granted 844,205 restricted share units to senior management. 
In addition to a service vesting requirement, the vesting of the restricted 
shar2011, and 2010 
is contingent upon the repayment of its Series A Preferred Stock and 
achievement of certain proﬁ tability requirements. Due to multiple vesting 
requirements of certain awards, the date Synovus expects all vesting 
criteria to be met is reviewed quarterly to ensure expense is amortized 
over the appropriate time period.
Share-based Compensation Expense
Synovus’ share-based compensation costs associated with employee grants 
are recorded as a component of salaries and other personnel expense in 
the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based compensation 
costs associated with grants made to non-employee directors of Synovus 
are recorded as a component of other operating expenses. Share-
based compensation expense for service-based awards is recognized 
net of estimated forfeitures for plan participants on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. Total share-based compensation expense was 
2011, and 2010, 
respectively. The total income tax beneﬁ t recognized in the consolidated 
statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements 
was apprmillion for 2012. No income tax beneﬁ t was 
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for share-based 
compensation arrangements for 2011 and $128 thousand was recognized 
for 2010. No share-based compensation costs have been capitalized for

espectively.
Management assesses the valuation allowance recorded against deferred 
tax assets at each reporting period. The determination of whether a 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate is subject to 
considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of all the positive and 
negative evidence. During 2009, the Company established a valuation allowance for substantially all of its deferred tax assets, primarily due 
to the realization of signiﬁ cant losses, signiﬁ cant credit deterioration, 
and negative trending in asset quality and uncertainty regarding the 
amount of future taxable income that the Company could forecast. At 
2011, based on the assessment of all the positive and 
negative evidence, management concluded that there was not sufﬁ cient 
evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that Synovus would 
realize the beneﬁ ts associated with its deferred tax assets; accordingly, 
the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance for substantially all of the deferred tax assets.
2012, the Company continues to be in a three-year 
cumulative loss position, which represents signiﬁ cant negative evidence. 
However, based on the assessment of all the positive and negative evidence, 
management concluded that it was mormillion 
of the net deferred tax assets will be realized based upon future taxable 
income, and therefore rmillion of the valuation allowance. 
2012 is related 
to speciﬁ c state income tax credits and speciﬁ c state NOL carryforwards 
that have various expiration dates through the tax year 2018 and 2027, 
respectively, and are expected to expire before they can be utilized.
The deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 after the achievement of operating results for the fourth 
quarter and full year of 2012 demonstrated the continuation of proﬁ table 
operating results, excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge of approximately 
million from the discretionary sales of distressed assets completed 
during the fourth quarter of 2012, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of proﬁ table operating results. The fourth quarter of 2012 results also provided 
further validation of the positive credit quality trending improvements marking 
the twelfth consecutive quarter of such improvements. The pace of credit 
quality improvement accelerated during the fourth quarter of 2012 after the 
completion of the bulk sale of distr2012, 
Synovus Bank’s classiﬁ ed asset ratio as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital 
and the allowance for loan losses improved to 38.07% from 50.65% at 
2011. The consolidated 
classiﬁ ed asset ratio impr2012 from 
2011, 
respectively.
In addition, the achievement of operating results for the fourth quarter and 
full year of 2012 consistent with management’s forecast for these periods, 
excluding the impact of the pre-tax charge of apprmillion 
from the discretionary sales of distressed assets completed in the fourth 
quarter of 2012, provided further evidence of the Company’s ability to 
produce reliable forecasts, and strengthened the weight of the positive 
evidence provided by forecasted future taxable income. The Company’s 
for2012 demonstrates that there 
will be sufﬁ cient future taxable income to rmillion net 
deferr2012. The positive evidence related to 
the forecasted future taxable income assists in overcoming the weight of 
the negative evidence related to the signiﬁ cant operating losses recognized 
as a result of the recent ﬁ nancial crisis and adds to the overall weight of 
2012 deferred tax asset is more 
likely than not realizable. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company 
was unable to conclude that there was sufﬁ cient evidence to support that 
the deferred tax asset was more likely than not realizable and to support 

the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
2012 included the Company’s 
signiﬁ cantly improved credit risk proﬁ le, the continued improving trends 
in credit quality, continued proﬁ tability in recent quarters, credit risk policy 
enhancements which reduce exposure to credit risk through concentration 
limits by loan type, exposure limits to single borrowers, among others, 
record of long-term positive earnings prior to the recent economic downturn, 
the Company’s strong capital position, as well as sufﬁ cient amounts of 
estimated future taxable income, of the appropriate character, to support 
the rs net deferred tax asset 
2012. Management’s conﬁ dence in the realization of 
projected future taxable income is based on an analysis of the Company’s 
risk proﬁ le and recent trends in ﬁ nancial performance, including credit 
quality trends. In determining whether management’s projections of future 
taxable income are reliable, management considered objective evidence 
supporting the forecast assumptions as well as recent experience which 
demonstrates the Company’s ability to reasonably project future results 
of operations. The analysis showed that credit losses will continue to be 
at elevated levels but will continue to trend downward, and that credit 
quality indicators will continue to improve. Further, while the banking 
environment is expected to remain challenging due to economic and other 
uncertainties, the Company believes that it can conﬁ dently forecast future 
taxable income at sufﬁ cient levels over the future period of time that the 
Company has available to r2012 net deferred tax 
asset, which is discussed further below.
Synovus expects to rmillion in net deferred tax assets well

The valuation allowance could ﬂ uctuate in future periods based on the 
assessment of the positive and negative evidence. Management’s conclusion 
2012 that it is more likely than not that the net deferred 
million will be realized is based upon management’s 
estimate of future taxable income. Management’s estimate of future 
taxable income is based on internal projections which consider historical 
performance, various internal estimates and assumptions, as well as 
certain external data all of which management believes to be reasonable 
although inherently subject to signiﬁ cant judgment. If actual results differ 
signiﬁ cantly from the current estimates of future taxable income, even if 
caused by adverse macro-economic conditions, the valuation allowance 
may need to be increased for some or all of the Company’s deferred tax 
asset. Such an increase to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
could have a material adverse effect on Synovus’ ﬁ nancial condition and 
results of operations.
States and by 
various state jurisdictions. Synovus’ federal income tax return is ﬁ led on 
a consolidated basis, while state income tax returns are ﬁ led on both 
a consolidated and separate entity basis. Currently, no years for which 
Synovus ﬁ led a federal income tax return are under examination by the 
IRS; also, there are no state tax examinations currently in progress. 
Synovus is no longer subject to income tax examinations from state and 
local income tax authorities for years before 2008. Although Synovus is 
unable to determine the ultimate outcome of future examinations, Synovus 
believes that the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions is adequate.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. In connection with the pr10-K, an evaluation was 
carried out by Synovus’ management, with the participation of Synovus’ Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, of the effectiveness of 
Synovus’ disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁ ned in Rules 13a-15(e) 
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)). 
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information 
required to be disclosed in reports ﬁ led or submitted under the Exchange Act 
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
speciﬁ ed in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, to allow timely decisions regarding required 
disclosures. Based on that evaluation, Synovus’ Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
and Chief Financial Ofﬁ 2012, 
Synovus’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Synovus regularly engages in productivity and efﬁ ciency initiatives to 
streamline operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenue. Additionally, 
investment in new and updated information technology systems has 
enhanced information gathering and processing capabilities, and allowed 
management to operate in a more centralized environment for critical 
processing and monitoring functions. Management of Synovus is responsible 
for identifying, documenting, and evaluating the adequacy of the design and operation of the controls implemented during each process change
