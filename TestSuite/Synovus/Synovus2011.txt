I.
  a  turningpoint2011 ANNUAL REPORTSynovus Financial Corp. is a financial services company 
with $27 billion in assets based in Columbus, Georgia. 

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Bank, 

member FDIC, the company provides commercial and 

retail banking, in addition to a full suite of specialized 

products and services including Private Banking, 

Treasury Management, Asset-based Lending, Wealth 

Management, and International Banking. Synovus 

also offers mortgage services, financial planning, and 

investment advisory services through its wholly-owned 

subsidiaries, Synovus Mortgage, Globalt, Synovus Trust, 

and Synovus Securities. These specialized offerings, 

combined with our traditional banking products and 

services, make Synovus Bank a great choice for retail 

and commercial customers.
Synovus Bank’s 30 locally branded divisions are 
positioned in some of the best markets in the Southeast, 

with 293 offices and 433 ATMs in Georgia, Alabama, 

South Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee. See Synovus on 

the web at www.synovus.com.
i.
2011 marked a turning point for our company. Focus, 
determination, and the crisp execution of our strategies 

for recovery and growth were the key drivers of our 

significant progress, including achieving our number one 

goal of returning to profitability. This accomplishment in 

the second half of the year was fueled by an improved 

overall credit picture, a more efficient cost structure that 

is better aligned with the current size of our organization, 

and investments in the talent, tools, and processes that 

enhance the customer experience and lead to growth. 
2011 EARNINGSWhile our return to profitability was a tremendous 

milestone for all of our key constituencies — shareholders, 

team members, and customers — our celebris 

tempered by 
the reality that 2012 is a year still influenced 
by a sluggish economy, our own remaining credit issues, 

and additional regulatory changes that impact not only 

our company but the earnings potential of the entire 

banking industry. 
Though these challenges certainly provide the backdrop 
for our work ahead, the momentum we carried into 

2012 has given our team even greater energy around 

doing what is needed to generate long-term growth 

and sustainable profitability. 
A BETTER CREDIT STORY
We continued our focus on credit quality in 2011 and our 

performance reflected significant improvement in most 

key credit quality metrics during the year, including 

a 57% decline in total credit costs from 2010 and 10 

consecutive quarters of reduction in total credit costs. 
Progress in this area was the primary driver in our return to 
profitability and was fueled by declines in net charge-offs 

and non-performing assets, lower levels of non-performing 

loan inflows, and continued success in the disposition 

of problem assets. Improvement was also facilitated by 

shifting those problem assets to a specialized workout 

group with the proper skill set for the best resolution of 

troubled credits. Although our credit problems remain 

elevated, we are pleased with our progress and expect 

continued improvements in each of these areas in 2012.

A FOCUS ON EFFICIENCY
Efficiency is an imperative for our company as we 
continue efforts to remain competitive in this new banking 

environment. We began last year by announcing a bold 

plan that was expected to generate expense savings of 

$75 million by year-end 2011, and annualized expense 

savings of $100 million by 2012. We actually exceeded the 

targeted 2011 impact of $75 million, which was a key driver 

of the $95.3 million reduction in core expenses* over 2010. 

Although the elimination of approximately 850 positions 

was the main component of our concentrated efforts, our 

efficiency initiatives were about much more than reducing 

workforce. We also redesigned and simplified many of 

our customer-facing processes to make us an easier bank 

with which to do business.

(2)A BETTER BANK FOR CUSTOMERS
To enhance the customer experience at Synovus, 
we addressed both retail and commercial banking 

opportunities. We streamlined deposit account opening, 

and redesigned our retail and commercial lending 

processes. These changes make it faster and easier for 

customers to open a deposit account or obtain a loan. 

We also made improvements to products and services 

that have been well received by the market, including 

the rollout of a leading-edge mobile banking tool and 
upgraded consumer online banking. In 2012, we will begin 
to install a new ATM network, improve our call center 

channel, and implement a whole new banking platform 

that gives team members more useful customer data as 

well as cross-selling and customer retention tools. 
A RETURN TO GROWTH 
At the heart of our growth strategy is a strong 

commitment to building relationships with commercial 

banking customers who truly benefit from our personal, 

high-touch banking style. To complement our excellent 

core banking talent, during 2011 Synovus assembled 

some of the most experienced, knowledgeable 

corporate bankers in the industry and empowered 

them with the ability to quickly identify needs and 

offer solutions to larger revenue companies. Because 
of our relationship-based delivery model, we are able 

to offer these companies a streamlined credit process 

that results in flexible and timely decisions. In addition, 

we added highly-skilled talent in other specialty areas 

such as our Senior Housing and Asset-Based Lending 

groups. These units partner with our local bankers to 

build relationships across our five-state footprint. Our 

teams are capitalizing on new business opportunities 

every day, and our more robust commercial banking 

strategy better integrates treasury management and 

asset-based lending offerings, facilitating growth in 

total customer relationships. The partnerships of our 

core bankers and specialty units produced outstanding 

results. We increased our loan pipeline and new loan 

fundings during each quarter of 2011 and achieved 

sequential quarter core loan growth** of approximately 

$167 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As encouraged as we were to see stabilization in our 
loan balances late last year, we were equally pleased by 

the shift in loan mix as we continued to diversify our loan 

portfolio and better position our company for the future. 

By the end of the year, we had substantially reduced our 

commercial real estate (CRE) concentration, especially 

in residential construction and development and land 

portfolios, and increased our commercial and industrial 

(C&I) and retail concentrations. CRE now represents 

36.2% of our total loan portfolio, down from a peak 

of 45.4% in 2007, and C&I and retail now represent 

approximately 64% of the total loan portfolio.

IMPROVEMENT IN CRE CONCENTRATIONS
C&I and RetailCRE45%1Q0755%36%64%4Q11While we believe we have made good progress in 
aligning our talent to best capture the opportunities 

within our markets, we recognize that revenue 

retention in 2012 and beyond will be challenged across 

our industry because of new laws and regulations. To 

address some of these pressures, our team has worked 

to develop specific retail and commercial fee income 

strategies that carefully consider customer impact, 

but also position us to generate appropriate financial 

returns for our company and our shareholders. With 

today’s competitive environment and skepticism about 

the integrity of banking institutions in general, there has 

never been a more important time to ensure we deliver 

value to our customers by truly understanding their 

individual needs, providing exceptional service, and 

delivering relevant banking products and solutions. 
A STRONG BANKING FRANCHISE
We remain solidly positioned in our markets and 

continue to enjoy top five deposit share in communities 

that represent almost 80% of our core banking 

franchise. Our ability to maintain these top market share 

positions throughout the tough economic environment 

speaks volumes about the loyalty of our customer 

base, the relationships built through our more than 

5,team members serving over 100 communities 

across the Southeast, and the strength of our overall 

local community brands.

IN CLOSING
On behalf of our entire team, I want to thank every 
shareholder for your continued loyalty to Synovus 

throughout our recovery and for remaining with us as 

we continue this exciting turn toward a brighter future. 

Your trust and confidence will be invaluable as we make 

strategic decisions and investments that position us as 

the Southeast’s bank of choice for customers, team 

members, and shareholders for years to come. 
Message from the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer
Each of our distinguished brands come together to 
form Synovus — one company, one bank. While our 

bank divisions have different names in each market, we 

are single-minded in our pursuit of high performance, 

our commitment to being a great place to work, our 

dedication to serving our communities, and the winning 

of customer relationships for life. 
We regularly receive feedback that affirms our relationship-
driven delivery model as a differentiator in a customer’s 

banking experience. Synovus and our 30 bank divisions 

were honorNational Awards for Excellence 

in Middle Market and Small Business Banking from the 

nationally-recognized Greenwich Associates program.
A BRIGHTER FUTUREThe journey back to profitability was certainly lined with 

challenges, yet our team was determined to conquer 

every one. Our team members deserve so much credit for 

our turnaround this past year. Their passion, commitment, 

determination, and resilience continue to inspire me 

and make me incredibly proud to be a part of this 

organization. Although we reached a critical inflection 

point as we returned to profitability during the second 

half of 2011, we remain grounded in the important work 

still ahead: the resolution of our remaining credit issues; 

a continued focus on efficiency; balance sheet growth; 

delighting our customers through exceptional service and 

fully integrated banking solutions; retaining and attracting 

top talent; and sustaining core profitability over time. 
We will continue to take steps to ensure our company’s 
long-term success. The issuance of $300 million in senior 

notes and the tender offer for $207 million principal 

notes maturing in 2013, both completed during the first 

quarter of 2012, were important achievements as we 

continue to position Synovus for TARP repayment.
Sincerely,
Kessel D. Stelling

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this Report which 
are not statements of historical fact, including those under “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” 
and elsewhere in this Report, constitute forward-looking statements within 
the meaning of, and subject to the pr27A of the 
21E of the Exchange Act. 
Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to Synovus’ 
beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, targets, expectations, anticipations, 
assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and involve 
known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond Synovus’ control and 
which may cause Synovus’ actual results, performance or achievements 
or the commercial banking industry or economy generally, to be materially 
different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or 
implied by such forward-looking statements.
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking 
statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements through 
Synovus’ use of words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “may,” 
“will,” “assumes,” “should,” “predicts,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “intends,” 
“targets,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “potential” and other similar words 
and expressions of the future or otherwise regarding the outlook for Synovus’ 
future business and ﬁ nancial performance and/or the performance of the 
commercial banking industry and economy in general. Forward-looking 
statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Synovus’ 
management and are subject to signiﬁ cant risks and uncertainties. Actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking 
statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this document. 
Many of these factors are beyond Synovus’ ability to control or predict. These 
factors include, but are not limited to:
(1) further deterioration in credit quality may result in increased non-
performing assets and credit losses, which could adversely impact 
our capital, ﬁ nancial condition, and results of operations;
(2) continuing declines in the values of residential and commercial real 
estate may result in further write-downs of assets and realized losses 
on disposition of non-performing assets, which may increase credit 
losses and negatively affect our ﬁ nancial results;
(3) continuing weakness in the residential and commercial real estate 
environment, which may negatively impact our ability to dispose of 
distressed assets, and may result in continued elevated levels of 
non-performing assets and potential problem loans;
(4) the impact on our borrowing costs, capital costs and our liquidity 
due to further adverse changes in our credit ratings;
(5) the risk that our allowance for loan losses may prove to be inadequate 
or may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures;
(6) the concentration of our non-performing assets by loan type, in 
certain geographic regions and with afﬁ liated borrowing groups;
(7) changes in the interest rate environment and competition in our 
primary market area may result in increased funding costs or reduced 
earning assets yields, thus reducing margins and net interest income;
(8) restrictions or limitations on access to funds from historical and 
alternative sources of liquidity could adversely affect our overall 
liquidity, which could restrict our ability to make payments on our 
obligations or dividend payments on our Common Stock and Series A preferred stock and our ability to support asset growth and sustain 
our operations and the operations of Synovus Bank;(9) future availability and cost of additional capital and liquidity on 
favorable terms, if at all;(10) the risks that we may be required to undertake additional strategic 
initiatives or seek or deploy additional capital to satisfy applicable 
regulatory capital standards and pressures in light of expected 
increases in capital and liquidity requirements or as a result of 
supervisory actions or directives;
(11) changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in

Business DevelopmentSynovus has traditionally focused on a strategy that includes expanding and diversifying its franchise in terms of revenues, proﬁ tability and asset 
size while maintaining a community banking, relationship-based approach 
to banking. This strategy has encompassed both organic growth and 
acquisitions of complementary banks and ﬁ nancial services businesses. 
During the 1990’s and through 2006, Synovus’ growth resulted largely 
from acquisitions of smaller community banks. As a result of the economic 
crisis that began in 2008, Synovus has refocused its efforts on initiatives to 
increase revenue through organic growth, lower its cost structure, reduce 
its concentration of CRE loans, strengthen its balance sheet and capital 
position and aggressively reduce non-performing assets.
Lending ActivitiesOverviewThe primary goal of Synovus’ lending function is to help clients achieve their ﬁ nancial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the 
client and proﬁ table to Synovus. Management believes that this purpose 
can best be accomplished by building strong, proﬁ table client relationships 
over time and maintaining a strong presence and position of inﬂ uence in the 
communities Synovus serves. Synovus strives to serve all of its customers with the highest levels of courtesy, respect, gratitude and fairness and 
deliver its services with unparalleled expertise, efﬁ ciency, responsiveness 
and accuracy. This relationship-based approach to banking enables 
Synovus’ bankers to develop a deep knowledge of Synovus’ customers and the markets in which they operate. Synovus has recently taken and 
continues to take steps to improve the consistency of its lending processes 
across all of its banking divisions, to strengthen the underwriting criteria 
it employs to evaluate new loans and loan renewals, and to diversify its 
loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. Synovus believes that these measures will better position it to meet the 
credit needs of businesses and consumers in the markets it serves while 
pursuing a balanced strategy of loan proﬁ tability, loan growth and loan quality.
Synovus conducts the majority of its lending activities within the framework 
of its relationship-based approach to banking built on creating long-term 
relationships with its customers. The following tables summarize Synovus’

7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report.Underwriting Approach
Recognizing that its loan portfolio is the primary source of revenue, Synovus’ 
management believes that proper and consistent loan underwriting 
throughout Synovus’ banking divisions is critical to Synovus’ long-term 
ﬁ nancial success. Synovus’ underwriting approach is designed to effectively 
govern the degree of assumed risk and ensure that its credit relationships 
conform to Synovus’ overall risk philosophy. During 2009 and 2010, Synovus 
transitioned its underwriting standards and key underwriting functions from 
a decentralized bank-by-bank approach to a more centralized regional 
approach and, ﬁ nally, to a centralized organization-wide approach with the 
completion of the Charter Consolidation. These underwriting standards 
address collateral requirements; guarantor requirements (including policies 
on ﬁ nancial statement, tax return, and limited guarantees); requirements 
regarding appraisals and their review; loan approval hierarchy; standard 
consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria (including 
credit score thresholds, maximum maturity and amortization, loan-to-value 
limits, global service coverage, and debt to income limits); commercial real 
estate and C&I underwriting guidelines (including minimum debt service coverage ratio, maximum amortization, minimum equity requirements, 
maximum loan-to-value ratios); lending limits; and credit approval authorities. 
Additionally, Synovus has implemented an enhanced loan concentration 
policy to limit and manage its exposure to certain loan concentrations, 
including commercial real estate. The enhanced loan concentration policy 
provides a more detailed program for portfolio risk management and 
reporting including limits on commercial rpercentage 
of risk-based capital (in the aggregate and by loan type), large borrower 
concentration limits and monitoring, as well as portfolio mix monitoring. Synovus’ underwriting process is structured to require oversight that is 
proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship.
Synovus utilizes a tiered credit approval process requiring larger loans to 
be approved by more senior bank ofﬁ cers as well as an independent senior 
credit ofﬁ cer, with the largest loans requiring approval of Synovus Bank’s 
Loan Committee. The centralized underwriting policy and philosophy also provides a more structured, and generally more conservative, approach to 
lending. For instance, loan-to-value limits on certain credits are now lower 
than regulatory requirements, large borrower concentration limits are now 
more explicit and lower than prior limits, and bank division lending limits 
are also lower than before. Furthermore, Synovus has established across 
all of its banking divisions more stringent underwriting requirements on 
certain types of commercial real estate lending, including loans for the 
purpose of ﬁ nancing shopping centers and hotels.
Prior to these initiatives, each of our 30 banking divisions had its own 
underwriting standards. While these separate underwriting standards were 
generally similar to each other and were all in compliance with regulatory 
requirements, the transition to uniform underwriting standards emphasizes 
a one-company view of our operating structure and promotes greater 
consistency throughout Synovus’ underwriting process.
Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Loan 
PortfolioThe C&I loan portfolio represents the largest category of Synovus’ total loan 
portfolio. Synovus’ C&I loan portfolio is currently concentrated on small to 
middle market commercial and industrial lending disbursed throughout a 
diverse group of industries in the Southeast, including health care, ﬁ nance 
and insurance, manufacturing, construction, real estate leasing and retail 
trade. The portfolio is relationship focused and, as a result, Synovus’ lenders 
have in-depth knowledge of the borrowers, most of which have guaranty 
arrangements. C&I loans are primarily originated through Synovus’ local 
market banking divisions and made to commercial customers primarily to 
ﬁ nance capital expenditures, including real property, plant and equipment, 
or as a sour2011, 43.1% of 
Synovus’ total C&I loans represented loans for the purpose of ﬁ nancing 
owner-occupied properties. The primary source of repayment on these 
C&I loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the 
borrower’s business. The secondary source of repayment on these C&I 
loans is the real estate securing such loans. In accordance with Synovus’ 
uniform lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, 
which incorporates the uniform underwriting approach, procedures and 
evaluations described above. Approximately 93% of Synovus’ C&I loans 
are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventory, and other types 
of collateral. T2011 werbillion, or 
44.5%, of the total loan portfolio.C&I lending is a key component of Synovus’ growth plans and diversiﬁ cation 
strategy (reducing overall concentration in CRE and grpercentage 
of C&I loans relative to the total loan portfolio). Synovus has actively invested 
in additional expertise, product offerings, and product quality to provide its 
commercial and industrial clients with increased and enhanced product 
offerings and customer service. Complementing this investment in C&I 
growth, Synovus’ management continues to focus on streamlining and 
enhancing Synovus’ existing product lines, especially for traditional retail, 
small business and professional services customers.
While lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been Synovus’ 
traditional focus, in 2010, Synovus formed a Large Corporate Banking Team to provide lending solutions to larger corporate clients in an effort 
to strengthen, diversify and further drive growth in Synovus’ C&I loan 
portfolio. In conjunction with the formation of the Large Corporate 
Banking Team, Synovus implemented a strategy to increase the level of 
participation in loan syndications which has contributed to the funding of apprmillion in loan syndications and an additional 
apprmillion in commitments during 2011. During mid-
2011, Synovus hired an experienced senior housing lending team. That 
team funded apprmillion of senior housing loans during 
the last half of 2011.8.
 PAR 
Commercial Real Estate Loan Portfolio
Synovus’ commercial real estate loans consist of investment property loans, 
residential construction and development loans, land acquisition loans, 
and 1-4 family perm/mini-perm loans. As is the case with Synovus’ C&I loans, the commercial real estate loans are primarily originated through 
Synovus Bank’s local market banking divisions. Total commercial real 
2011 werbillion, or 36.2%, of 
the total loan portfolio.Investment Property Loans
Synovus’ investment property loans are primarily made to ﬁ nance multi-
family properties, hotels, ofﬁ ce buildings, shopping centers, warehouses 
and other commercial development properties. Synovus’ investment 
property portfolio is well diversiﬁ ed with no concentration by property type, 
geography or tenants. These loans are generally recourse in nature with 
years or less), allowing for restructuring opportunities 
which reduces Synovus’ overall risk exposure. The investment property 
loans are primarily secured by the property being ﬁ nanced by the loans; 
however, they may also be secured by real estate or other assets beyond 
the property being ﬁ nanced. Investment property loans are subject to the 
same uniform lending policies and procedures described above, although 
such loans have historically been underwritten with stressed interest rates 
and vacancies. In addition, Synovus has placed restrictions on both hotel 
and shopping center lending. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Synovus 
began quarterly reviews of all investment prmillion 
or more to more closely monitor the performance of the portfolio. Total 
investment pr2011 werbillion, 
or 62.7%, of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio.
Residential Construction and Development and Land 
Acquisition LoansThe residential construction and development loans and land acquisition 
loans are almost always secured by the underlying property being ﬁ nanced 
by such loans. These properties are primarily located in the markets served 
by Synovus. Given the continued turmoil in the housing and real estate 
markets, including declining real estate prices in certain markets and high 
levels of foreclosures, Synovus has actively and successfully reduced its 
exposure to residential construction and development and land acquisition 
years, including its exposure to the Atlanta market. 
Residential Construction and Development and Land Acquisition loans in 2011, down 
23.6% from a year ago and down approximately 79% from its high in 
2007. These loans are generally subject to the same 
uniform lending policies and procedures described above. Land acquisition 
loans have a maximum loan-to-value limit which is aligned with regulatory 
requirements. Synovus has tightened the maximum loan-to-value limit for 
residential construction and development loans to levels more stringent

Additionally, underwriting standards for these types of loans include stricter

Retail Loan PortfolioSynovus’ retail loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products 
offered through its banking network, including residential mortgages, home 
equity lines, credit card loans, and other retail loans. These various types 
of secured and unsecured retail loans are marketed to qualifying existing 
clients and to other creditworthy candidates in Synovus’ market area. The 
majority of Synovus’ retail loans are consumer mortgages secured by ﬁ rst 
and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets 
served by Synovus in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, and 
Tennessee. Retail loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies 
and procedures described above and consist primarily of loans with strong 
credit scores, conservative debt-to-income ratios, and loan-to-value ratios 
based upon prudent guidelines to ensure consistency with Synovus’ overall 
risk philosophy. Total r2011 werbillion, 
or 19.3%, of the total loan portfolio.Mortgage BankingSynovus Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Mortgage, originates 
rbillion in 2011. 
Synovus Mortgage offers various types of ﬁ xed- and adjustable-rate loans 
for the purposes of purchasing, reﬁ nancing or constructing residential 
properties. The originated loans are primarily conforming mortgage loans for 
owner-occupied properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten 
in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by government 
sponsored entities such as the Federal National Mortgage Association 
and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. These are generally 
collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate properties and are 
made to borrowers in good credit standing.
Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage 
are sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without 
recourse, or continuing involvement. Each purchaser of our mortgage 
loans has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans, and the 
risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is 
generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans are sold 
without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus Mortgage to 
make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and 
sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or 
other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. 
If it is determined that the loans sold were in breach of these representations 
or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the 
loan for the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the 
purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of the loan.

Other Loans Held for Sale PortfolioWith the exception of certain ﬁ rst lien residential mortgage loans, Synovus 
originates loans with the intent to hold those loans to maturity. Loans or 
pools of distressed loans are transferred to the other loans held for sale 
portfolio when the intent to hold the loans has changed due to portfolio management or risk mitigation strategies and a determination to sell 
speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans has been made. The value of the loans or pools 
of loans is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of the 
loan and the anticipated market prices of similar assets less estimated costs 
to sell. At the time of transfer, if the fair value less selling costs is less than 
the carrying amount of the speciﬁ c loans, with such difference generally 
being attributable to declines in credit quality, the shortfall is recorded as

Credit Quality
Synovus continuously monitors credit quality and maintains an allowance 
for loan losses that management believes is sufﬁ cient to absorb probable 
and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Synovus continues to 
address problem assets and reduce future exposures through its asset 
disposition strategy, which centers around the disposition of distressed 
assets, as a proactive measure in managing the loan portfolio. Subsequent 
to the implementation of the asset disposition strategy, Synovus entered 
into the Synovus MOU. The Synovus MOU was in alignment with the 
existing asset disposition strategy, including managing various asset 
quality and regulatory capital ratios. The asset disposition program is 
still in place today. Net charge-offs recorded during the thryears 
2011 related to this strategy were approximately 
million. For a more detailed discussion of Synovus’ credit quality,

Alabama, and Tennessee. C&I loans represent 44.5% of the total loan

these loans consist primarily of marketable equipment, marketable inventory, 
accounts receivable, equity and debt securities, and time deposits. Total 
commercial real estate loans represent 36.2% of the total loan portfolio at 
2011. These loans are primarily secured by commercial real 
estate, including 1-4 family properties, land, and investment properties. 
The collateral generally consists of the property being ﬁ nanced by the

processes for its loan portfolio. Synovus updates the fair value of the real

quarter, with appraisals usually received on an annual basis, or sooner if 
appropriate, from an independent, unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser. 
Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such 
as selling costs and anticipated sales values considering management’s 
plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments to the collateral 
value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Synovus updates the values of collateral that is in the form of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, 
and cash surrender value of life insurance policies at least annually and 
the values of collateral that is in the form of marketable securities and 
brokerage accounts at least monthly.
It is the Company’s policy to obtain, on at least an annual basis, an 
updated appraisal from an independent, unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed 
appraiser for loan rmillion and over when at least one 
of the loans in the relationship is on non-accrual status. For relationships 
million, while independent appraisals are not mandated by 
the Company’s policies, management will obtain such appraisals when 
considered prudent. For credits that are not on impaired status, Synovus 
generally obtains an unafﬁ liated third-party appraisal of the value of the 
real estate collateral prior to each loan renewal. Additionally, if conditions 
warrant (e.g., loans that are not considered impaired but exhibit a higher 
or potentially higher risk), Synovus engages an unafﬁ liated appraiser to 
reappraise the value of the collateral on a more frequent basis. Examples 
of circumstances that could warrant a new appraisal on an existing 
performing credit include instances where local market conditions where 
the real estate collateral is located have deteriorated, the collateral has 
experienced damage (ﬁ re, wind damage, etc.), the lease or sell-out of 
the collateral has not met the original projections, and the net operating 
income of the collateral has declined. In circumstances where the collateral 
is no longer considered sufﬁ cient, Synovus seeks to obtain additional 
collateral. Examples of adjustments made quarterly to appraised values include broker’s commission, unpaid real estate taxes, attorney’s fees, 
other estimated costs to dispose of the property, known damage to the 
property, known declines in the net operating income of the property or 
rent rolls, as well as third-party market data.
Loan GuaranteesIn addition to collateral, Synovus generally requires a guarantee from all 
principals on all commercial real estate and C&I lending relationships. 
Speciﬁ cally, Synovus generally obtains unlimited guarantees from any 
entity (e.g., individual, corporation, or partnership) that owns or controls 
cent or more of the borrowing entity. Limited guarantees on a pro 
rata basis are generally requircent or more owners.
Synovus evaluates the ﬁ nancial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation 
of the guarantor’s current ﬁ nancial statements, income tax returns for 
the two most ryears, as well as ﬁ nancial information regarding a 
guarantor’s business or related interests. In addition, Synovus analyzes 
substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor 
has the necessary ownership or control over these assets. For loans that 
are not considered impaired, the allowance for loan losses is determined 
based on the risk rating of each loan. The risk rating incorporates a 
number of factors, including guarantors. If a loan is rated doubtful, with 
certain limited exceptions, a guarantee is not considered in determining 
the amount to be charged-off (i.e., the charge-off equals the greater of 
the amount of the collateral exposure or 50% of the loan balance, in 
compliance with regulatory requirements).
With certain limited exceptions, Synovus seeks performance under 
guarantees in the event of a borrower’s default. However, under the 
current economic environment, and based on the fact that a majority of 
our problem credits are commercial real estate credits, our success in 
recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited.
Unsecured Loans
2011, Synovus had unsecured loans totaling approximately 
billion, which represents approximately 5% of total loans. This 
edit card loans and 
apprmillion in commercial loans to borrowers that are 
primarily in the manufacturing, insurance, ﬁ nancial services, utilities, and 

religious organization sectors.
Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for 
Loan LossesDespite credit standards, internal controls, and a continuous loan review 
process, the inherent risk in the lending process results in periodic charge-
offs. The provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings 
necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. Through the 
provision for loan losses, Synovus maintains an allowance for losses on 
loans that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses 
inherent within the loan portfolio. However, future additions to the allowance 
may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower’s ability to pay and/or 
collateral values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral 
part of their examination procedures, periodically review Synovus Bank’s 
10.
 PAR 
allowance for loan losses. Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may 
require Synovus Bank to recognize additions to its allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus, including the Credit Risk Committee, for accuracy 
and consistency between the changes in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in the loan portfolio. The allowance 
for loan losses is determined based on an analysis which assesses the inherent risk for probable losses within the loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant 
judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the 
allowance for loan losses, Signiﬁ cant judgments include, among others, 
loan risk ratings and classiﬁ cations, the determination and measurement 
of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan 
defaults, the net loss exposure in event of loan defaults, qualitative loss 
factors, management’s plans, if any, for disposition of certain loans as well 
as other qualitative considerations.See the “Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses”

Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report for a more 
detailed discussion of Synovus’ provision for loan losses and allowance 
for loan losses.Non-performing Assets and Past Due LoansNon-performing assets consist of loans classiﬁ ed as non-accrual, impaired 
loans held for sale and real estate acquired through foreclosure. Synovus’ 
management continuously monitors non-performing and past due loans to prevent further deterioration regarding the condition of these loans. In 
order to reduce non-performing asset levels, Synovus has aggressively 
disposed of non-performing assets over the last thryears. While 
Synovus still has an elevated level of non-performing assets, Synovus’ 2011 were at their lowest

Synovus’ non-performing assets and past due loans.Investment ActivitiesOur investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities classiﬁ ed as available for sale. Investment securities available for sale 
provide Synovus with a source of liquidity and a relatively stable source 
of income. The investment securities portfolio also provides management 
with a tool to balance the interest rate risk of its loan and deposit portfolios.
Our investment strategy focuses on the use of the investment securities portfolio to manage the interest rate risk created by the inherent mismatch 
between the loan and deposit portfolios. Synovus also utilizes a signiﬁ cant 
portion of its investment portfolio to secure certain deposits and other 
liabilities r2011, approximately 
billion of these investment securities were pledged as required 
collateral for certain deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, 
payment network arrangements, and FHLB advances. As such, the 
investment securities are primarily GSE debentures and mortgage-backed 
securities issued by GSEs, all of which have a high degree of liquidity and 
limited credit risk. A mortgage-backed security depends on the underlying 
pool of mortgage loans to provide a cash ﬂ ow pass-through of principal 
and inter2011, all of the collateralized mortgage 
obligations and mortgage-backed pass-through securities held by Synovus 
were issued or backed by federal agencies.
Synovus also holds state and municipal securities and limited equity 
securities.Funding ActivitiesLiquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available sources 
of funding to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers, and creditors, to 
support asset growth, to maintain reserve requirements, and to otherwise 
sustain operations of Synovus and its subsidiary, Synovus Bank, at a 
reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences. 
Deposits represent the largest source of funds for lending and investing 
activities. Scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities 
from our loan and investment portfolios also provide a stable source of 
funds. Additional funding sources which provide liquidity include FHLB 
bank advances, brokered deposits and other short-term borrowed funds, 
as well as through equity and debt issued through the capital markets, 
including our recent public offerings. Synovus’ ALCO, operating under 
liquidity and funding policies approved by the Board of Directors, actively 
analyzes contractual and anticipated cash ﬂ ows in order to properly 
manage Synovus’ liquidity position. Following is a brief description of the various sources of funds used by Synovus. For further discussion relating 
to Synovus’ funding sources, please refer to the sections titled “Deposits”

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report 11, “Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings,” to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements herein.
DepositsDeposits provide the most signiﬁ cant funding source for Synovus’ interest 
earning assets and remain a strength of Synovus’ business. Deposits are 
attracted principally from clients within Synovus’ retail branch network 
through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals 
and businesses, including non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, 
interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, money 
market deposit accounts, and time deposit accounts. Synovus also utilizes 
brokered deposits as a funding source in addition to deposits attracted 
through its retail branch network. Terms vary among deposit products with 
respect to commitment periods, minimum balances, and applicable fees. 
Interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of Synovus’ 
interest expense. Interest rates offered on interest-bearing deposits are 
determined based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, interest rates offercurrent and 
anticipated future interthe 
the availability 
and cost of alternative funding sources. Client deposits are attractive 
sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. Deposits 
are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and 
provide opportunities to cross-sell other Synovus services.

Borrowed Funds and Non-Deposit Liquidity
Synovus’ ability to borrow funds from non-deposit sources provides 
additional ﬂ exibility in meeting the liquidity needs of Synovus. Synovus 
generates non-deposit liquidity through maturities and repayments of loans 
by customers and access to sources of funds other than deposits. Synovus 
Bank has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the 
2011, Synovus Bank had access to incremental 
funding, subject to available collateral and FHLB credit policies, through 
utilization of FHLB advances.In addition to bank level liquidity management, Synovus must manage liquidity at the Parent Company level for various operating needs including 
capital infusions into subsidiaries, the servicing of debt, the payment of 
general corporate expenses, and the payment of dividends to shareholders. 
The primary source of liquidity for Synovus has historically consisted of 
dividends from its subsidiaries, including Synovus Bank, which is governed 
by certain rules and regulations of the GA DBF and the FDIC. During 2011, 
Synovus did not receive any dividends from Synovus Bank. Synovus’ ability 
to receive dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on 
a number of factors, including, without limitation, Synovus Bank’s future 
proﬁ ts, asset quality and overall ﬁ nancial condition. Synovus may not 
receive dividends from Synovus Bank in 2012, which could adversely 
affect liquidity- Supervision, Regulation 
ryears has relied on the 
capital markets to provide needed liquidity resources, including its public 
of2010 and February 2012. 
Despite the success of these recent public offerings, in light of the current 
regulatory environment, market conditions, Synovus’ ﬁ nancial performance 
and related credit ratings, there can be no assurance that Synovus would 
be able to obtain additional new borrowings or issue additional equity on

7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report.Enterprise Risk ManagementAs a ﬁ nancial services organization, Synovus accepts a certain degree of 
risk with each business decision it makes. Risk management does not eliminate risk, but seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk 
and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. Understanding 
our risks and managing them appropriately can enhance our ability to make 
better decisions, deliver on objectives, and improve performance. A risk 
management framework has been established within Synovus, which begins 
with the Board of Directors, working primarily with the Audit Committee 
and the Risk Committee of the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors fulﬁ lls the overarching oversight role for the risk management 
process, including approval of risk tolerance levels and risk policies and 
limits. The Risk Committee assists the Audit Committee in overseeing and monitoring risks and fulﬁ lling its oversight role for risk management, 
monitoring key and emerging risks and reviewing risk assessments. The 
Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer reports to the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and provides overall 
vision, direction and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management 

framework.The risk management framework includes an Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer that consists of all Synovus’ corporate 
executive ofﬁ cers and the Senior Director of Enterprise Risk. The committee 
meets regularly to monitor Synovus’ key and emerging risks and ensure 
that these risks are within acceptable tolerances. Senior management 
risk committees oversee the various risk types within the Company as shown below and provide minutes of activities and decisions to the Board 
of Directors. These committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk 
measurement and management in their respective areas of authority. The 
Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer is an active member of each of these management risk 
committees. •ALCO -Interest Rate/Market Risk and Liquidity Risk
 •Credit Risk
 • • •- Reputation Risk, Litigation Risk, and Strategic 
RiskManagement believes that Synovus’ primary risk exposures are credit, 
liquidity, operational, and regulatory compliance risk. Credit risk is risk of loss 
arising from our borrowers’ or counterparties’ inability to meet the ﬁ nancial 
terms of any contract with the Company, or other failure to perform as 
agreed. Liquidity risk arises from an inability of the Company to meet current 
or future obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable 
losses. Operational risk arises from the potential that inadequate information 
systems, operational problems, inadequate or failed internal controls, human 
error, fraud or external events will result in unexpected losses. Compliance 
risk arises from nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply 
to the ﬁ nancial services industry and exposes the Company to monetary 
penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions.
ALCOALCO monitors Synovus’ economic, competitive, and regulatory environment 
and is responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity 
and funding risk, interest rate risk, and market risk and has the authority 
to create policies relative to these risks. ALCO, operating under liquidity 
and funding policies approved by the Board of Directors, actively analyzes 
contractual and anticipated cash ﬂ ows in order to properly manage

- Liquidity” 
- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market 
Risk.” in this Report.Credit Risk
The Company has established a credit risk management process with 
policies, controls and regular Board and management oversight. Credit 
risk management is guided by centralized credit policies that provide for 
a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of 
credits. The Credit Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, 
monitors credit management reports, establishes lending policies, limits, 
and guidance to better manage the loan function, and provides strategies 
to reduce the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio. The Credit Risk 
Committee oversees risk grade accuracy, credit servicing requirements, 
and loan concentration levels and manages risk in the execution of loan growth strategies.
The Regional Credit function reports to the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer, providing 
independence from the line of business. Regional Credit manages credit 
activities within each region, underwriting borrowing relationships over 
certain dollar thresholds, jointly approving loans over the banking division’s 
lending authority, and ensuring that loan administration processes for each 
banking division are sound and appropriate.
Synovus created MAD during 2011 to better execute aggressive resolution 
strategies for problem credits through workouts, modiﬁ cations and asset 
dispositions, allowing lenders to focus on developing new relationships 
and expand existing relationships. MAD team members possess the 
specialized skill set to efﬁ ciently execute workouts and dispositions. This 
centralization of problem credits allows Synovus’ commercial bankers to 
focus on lending and other growth opportunities.

Synovus has established the ALLL Oversight Council to review and 
approve the adequacy of the allowance and ALLL methodology. The 
ALLL Oversight Council includes the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer, Chief Credit Ofﬁ cer, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, and Chief Accounting Ofﬁ cers and the Enterprise 
Risk Management Director and the Loan Review Director. The Council 
meets at least on a quarterly basis. The allowance adequacy and the 
ALLL methodology are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors on at least a quarterly basis.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Synovus completed the implementation of a centralized Retail Lending Center where consumer loans are centrally 
processed, scored, and analyzed. This structure will simplify the control 
environment, drive efﬁ ciencies, and improve the overall customer experience.
Compliance RiskCompliance laws, rules and standards generally cover matters such as 
observing proper standards of market conduct, managing conﬂ icts of 
interest, treating customers fairly, and ensuring the suitability of customer 
advice. They also include basic prudential banking requirements and speciﬁ c 
areas such as the prevention of money laundering and terrorist ﬁ nancing.
The Regulatory Compliance Risk Committee was formed to assist the Board 
and management in overseeing the management of overall compliance risk, 
development and implementation of policy, and ensuring that compliance 
issues are resolved effectively and expeditiously. The Committee is made 
up of senior management from the business lines, risk management, legal, 
human resources, and compliance functions and speciﬁ cally provides 
oversight for the Corporate Compliance Policy and Programs, BSA/
AML Policy and Programs, new and modiﬁ ed products and services and 
compliance examination exceptions throughout the Company. Written 
policies contain the principles to be followed by management and staff 
of the banking divisions, subsidiaries and business lines throughout the 
Company and explain and direct the processes by which risks are identiﬁ ed 
and managed. The individual policies guide the Company’s compliance 
functions and provide for monitoring, training, and risk assessments.
Operational RiskSynovus aims to avoid and reduce unexpected loss through judicious risk 
management by instilling a proactive and structured approach to operational 
risk management. The Operational Risk Committee is responsible for 
providing oversight of the operational risk function to ensure there are 
effective processes to assess, monitor and mitigate operational risk. 
Additionally, the Operational Risk Committee is the approval vehicle for the 
ORM Framework. Speciﬁ c responsibilities include (1) providing a forum for 
addressing operational issues that require coordination and/or cooperation 
of multiple operational groups; (2) the identiﬁ cation and prioritization of 
operational risk initiatives; (3) the review of signiﬁ cant operational risk 
exposures and their conformance to Synovus’ stated operational risk 
objectives; (4) assembling ad hoc committees to address key areas of 
operational risk identiﬁ ed by the committee and (5) annually reviewing the 
risk metrics for ongoing pertinence to the risk management framework.Operational Risk Management is responsible for assessing systems 
and processes designed and implemented by management, promoting 
operating efﬁ ciency and encouraging compliance with laws, regulations 
and internal policies to ensure they are adequately designed, controlled 
and functioning effectively.
Business Units and Support Functions are accountable for ensuring that 
the Operational Risk Management Policy is properly communicated and 
understood within their respective organizational units. Business Units are 
also responsible for identifying and reporting operational risk trends that 
require resolution, participate in risk assessments, respond to changes in 
risk metrics and to implement corrective actions and new risk solutions 
(policies, technology, process change, personnel).
ORM has developed an array of program tools to assists business units 
in effectively managing operational risk. The program tools will ensure 
standardized implementation of the ORM Framework across the enterprise. 
ORM Program tools include Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA), Issue 
Tracking, Loss Data Management and Incident Response.
Strategic RiskThe Strategic Risk Committee is charged with identifying key strategic risks which might threaten the strategic direction and/or long-term viability 
of Synovus, bringing those risks to the attention of the appropriate 
Synovus decision-making body, and verifying that Synovus puts in place 
activities designed to address those risks. This committee is made up of 
all members of executive management, who look beyond their functional areas of responsibility and take a holistic view of the organization and the 
environment in which it operates.
CompetitionThe ﬁ nancial services industry is highly competitive and could become 
more competitive as a result of recent and ongoing legislative, regulatory 
and technological changes, and continued consolidation and economic turmoil within the ﬁ nancial services industry. The ability of nonbanking 
ﬁ nancial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial 
banks also has intensiﬁ ed competition. Our bank subsidiary and wholly-
owned non-bank subsidiaries compete actively with national and state banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions and other nonbank 
ﬁ nancial institutions, including securities brokers and dealers, investment 
advisory ﬁ rms, mortgage companies, insurance companies, trust companies, 
ﬁ nance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies and certain 
governmental agencies, all of which actively engage in marketing various 
types of loans, deposit accounts and other ﬁ nancial services. These 
competitors have been successful in developing products that are in 
direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered 
by traditional banking institutions. Our ability to deliver strong ﬁ nancial 
performance will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of, and effectively deliver, products and services, which will allow us to meet 
the changing needs of our customers.2011, we were the second largest bank holding 
company headquartered in Georgia, based on assets. Customers for 
ﬁ nancial services are generally inﬂ uenced by convenience, quality of 
service, personal contacts, price of services and availability of products. 
Although our market share varies in different markets, we believe that our 
community-focused relationship banking approach enables us to compete 
effectively with other banks and thrifts in their relevant market areas.

Supervision, Regulation and Other FactorsLike all bank holding companies and ﬁ nancial holding companies, we are 
regulated extensively under federal and state law. In addition, Synovus 
Bank and certain of our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation 
under federal and state law. The following discussion sets forth some of 
the elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us and certain 
of our subsidiaries. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the 
protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the 
protection of security holders and creditors. To the extent that the following 
information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualiﬁ ed in its 
entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions.
GeneralBank holding companies and ﬁ nancial holding companies are subject 
to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, the GA DBF regulates holding companies that own Georgia-charted banks 
under the bank holding company laws of the State of Georgia. Synovus Bank, which is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, which we refer to as the FDIC, and by its state banking 
regulator, the GA DBF. Numerous other federal and state laws, as well as 
regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, the state banking 
regulator and the FDIC govern almost all aspects of the operations of 
Synovus Bank. Synovus Trust Company, a subsidiary of Synovus Bank 
that provides trust services, is organized as a national bank and thus is 
subject to regulation and supervision by the Ofﬁ ce of the Comptroller of 
the Currency. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise 
our non-bank subsidiaries including our brokerage, investment advisory, 
insurance agency and processing operations. These include, but are not 
limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, federal 
and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance 
and brokerage activities.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, which is discussed in greater detail 
below, establishes the CFPB, a new federal agency with broad authority 
to regulate the offering and provision of consumer ﬁ nancial products. 
Rulemaking authority for a range of consumer ﬁ nancial protection laws 
(such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and 
the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) transferred from the prudential 
r2011. The CFPB will have the authority 
to supervise and examine depository institutions with morbillion 
in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority billion or less in 
assets for compliance with federal consumer laws will remain largely with 
those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate 
in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their 
primary regulators. The CFPB will also have regulatory and examination 
authority over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer ﬁ nancial 
products. The Dodd-Frank Act identiﬁ es a number of covered nonbank 
ﬁ nancial institution, and also authorizes the CFPB to identify additional 
institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction.Permitted ActivitiesUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of morpercent 
es of, any company engaged in the following activities:
 •banking or managing or controlling banks;
 •furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and
 •any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely 
related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, 
including: –factoring accounts receivable;
 –making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related 
activities; –leasing personal or real property;
 –operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings 
association; –performing trust company functions; –providing ﬁ nancial and investment advisory activities;
 –conducting discount securities brokerage activities;
 –underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money 
market instruments; –providing speciﬁ ed management consulting and counseling activities;
 –performing selected data processing services and support services;
 –acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types 
of insurance in connection with credit transaction;
 –performing selected insurance underwriting activities; –providing certain community development activities (such as making 
investments in projects designed primarily to promote community 
welfare); and
 –issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment 
instruments. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to order a bank holding 
company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate 
its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause 
to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity 
or control constitutes a serious risk to the ﬁ nancial safety, soundness or 
stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a bank holding company may ﬁ le 
an election with the Federal Reserve Board to be treated as a ﬁ nancial 
holding company and engage in an expanded list of ﬁ nancial activities. 
The election must be accompanied by a certiﬁ cation that the company’s 
insured depository institution subsidiary is “well capitalized” and “well 
managed.” Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 rating 
of the bank holding company’s subsidiary bank(s) must be satisfactory 
or better. We have made such an election and are treated as a ﬁ nancial 
holding company. As such, we may engage in activities that are ﬁ nancial 
in nature or incidental or complementary to ﬁ nancial activities, including 
insurance underwriting, securities underwriting and dealing, and making merchant banking investments in commercial and ﬁ nancial companies. If 
our banking subsidiary ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, 
among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these 
broader ﬁ nancial activities or, if the deﬁ ciencies persist, require us to divest 
the banking subsidiary. In addition, if our banking subsidiary receives a 
rating of less than satisfactory under the Community Reinvestment Act, we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other 
than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not ﬁ nancial 
holding companies. If, after becoming a ﬁ nancial holding company and 
undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company, the 
company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for ﬁ nancial 
holding company status, including those described above, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply 
with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company 
does not returdays, the Federal Reserve may 
order the company to divest its subsidiary bank or the company may 
discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in, activities 
permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated 
as a ﬁ nancial holding company.

Actions by Federal and State RegulatorsLike all bank and ﬁ nancial holding companies, we are regulated extensively 
under federal and state law. Under federal and state laws and regulations 
pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, 
state banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC 
as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict 
certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufﬁ cient capital 
or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be 
deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under 
this authority, our bank regulators can require us to enter into informal or 
formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda 
of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist 
orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identiﬁ ed corrective 
actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.
As a result of losses that we have incurred to date and our high level of 
credit losses and non-performing assets, we entered into a memorandum 
of understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Georgia 
Commissioner, pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are 
intended to, among other things, minimize credit losses and reduce the 
amount of our distressed assets, limit and manage our concentrations 
in commercial loans, improve our credit risk management and related 
policies and procedures, address liquidity management and current 
and future capital requirements, strengthen enterprise risk management 
practices, and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional 
management positions and our board of directors. The memorandum of 
understanding also requires that we inform and consult with the Federal 
Reserve Board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends, and 
obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the 
Georgia Commissioner prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend on 
our Common Stock above $0.01 per share.
In addition, Synovus Bank is presently subject to a memorandum of 
understanding with the Georgia Commissioner and the FDIC that is 
substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company 
memorandum of understanding described above. The bank memorandum 
of understanding also requires that Synovus Bank obtain approval from the 
Georgia Commissioner and the FDIC prior to paying any cash dividends 
to Synovus and provides that, as a result of our Charter Consolidation, 
we will take all necessary steps to avoid customer confusion as a result 
of our proposed use of trade names at our various bank branches and to 
update our long-term strategic plan to reﬂ ect the Charter Consolidation 
and the various actions we have otherwise agreed to implement under the 
memorandum of understanding. Also, as a result of recent compliance 
exams, Synovus Bank entered into an informal written agreement with 
the FDIC relating to certain compliance matters. Under this agreement, 
Synovus Bank is required to implement written action plans, policies and 
procedures to address and remediate identiﬁ ed compliance concerns and 
furnish written quarterly progress reports to the FDIC.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory 
agreements, or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with the 
terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or

Standards for Safety and Soundness
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory 
agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial 
standards for all insured depository institutions rinternal

crinterest rate risk exposurasset quality. 
The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, 
and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and 
beneﬁ ts. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and 
Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness 
to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the 
safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems 
at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under 
the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any 
standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the 
bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness 
compliance plans.DividendsSynovus is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Under 
the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare 
and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or declaration 
would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles of Incorporation, 
or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay 
our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In 
addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements 
that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends, if any that we may pay.
Under the Federal Reserve Board guidance r2009 
the Federal Reserve may restrict our ability to pay dividends on any class of 
capital stock or any other T1 capital instrument if we are not deemed to 
have a strong capital position. In addition, we may have to reduce or eliminate 
dividends if: •our net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net 
of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufﬁ cient to fully 
fund the dividends;  •our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the

in advance of declaring or paying any future dividends, and the Federal 
Reserve Board could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our 
Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock could be an unsafe or unsound 
banking practice. In the current ﬁ nancial and economic environment, the 
Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should 
carefully review their dividend policy and has in some cases discouraged 
payment unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. In addition, 
pursuant to the terms of the Synovus Bank memorandum of understanding, 
Synovus Bank cannot pay any cash dividends without the approval of 
the FDIC and the Georgia Commissioner. Additionally, we are subject to 

contractual restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends if there is an 

event of default under such contract.The primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our shareholders 
are cash on hand and dividends from our bank and non-bank subsidiaries. 
Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount 
of dividends that Synovus Bank and our non-banking subsidiaries may pay. 
Synovus Bank is a Georgia bank. Under the regulations of the GA DBF, a 
Georgia bank must have approval of the GA DBF to pay cash dividends if, at 
the time of such payment: •the ratio of Tpercent;
 •the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be 
declared during the currpercent of its net 
after-tax proﬁ ts for the previous calendar year; or
 •its total classiﬁ ed assets in its most recent regulatory examination

losses, as reﬂ ected in the examination.
In addition, the Georgia Financial Institutions Code currently contains 
restrictions on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than 
from retained earnings. A bill to amend this restriction is pending before 
the Georgia legislature and is expected to be signed into law during the 
2012 legislative session. If the law is not amended, we will be unable to obtain any dividends from Synovus Bank until such time as Synovus Bank 
has sufﬁ cient positive retained earnings.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act generally 
prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, 
including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. 
In addition, federal banking regulations applicable to us and our bank 
subsidiary require minimum levels of capital that limit the amounts available 
for payment of dividends. In addition, many regulators have a policy, 
but not a requirement, that a dividend payment should not exceed net 
income to date in the current year. Finally, the ability of banks and bank 
holding companies to pay dividends, and the contents of their respective 
dividend policies, could be impacted by a range of changes imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which will require implementing rules to 
become effective.

Corrective Action” below.
Our Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve Board adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses 
the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding 
company or ﬁ nancial holding company and in analyzing applications to it 
under the Bank Holding Company Act. These guidelines include quantitative 
measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet 
items and that deﬁ ne and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. 
All bank holding companies are required to maintain T1 Capital of at 
percent of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items, Total 
Capital (the sum of T1 Capital and Tpercent 
of risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items and T1 Capital of 
cent of adjusted quarterly average assets.
T1 Capital consists principally of shareholders’ equity less any amounts 
of goodwill, other intangible assets, non-ﬁ nancial equity investments, and 
other items that are required to be deducted by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Tier 2 Capital consists principally of perpetual and trust preferred stock 
that is not eligible to be included as T1 Capital, term subordinated 
debt, intermediate-term preferred stock and, subject to limitations, general 
allowances for loan and lease losses. Assets are adjusted under the risk-
based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics. Average 
assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the Federal Reserve Board determines should 
be deducted from T
This regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important 
respects as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and a separate, international 
rIII.” In particular, the Dodd-
Frank Act eliminates T1 capital treatment for most trust preferred 
securities after a thr2013. 
Furthermore, the current risk-based capital guidelines that apply to 
Synovus and its subsidiary bank are based upon the 1988 capital accord 
of the BCBS, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors. The 
I standards to which U.S. banks and bank and ﬁ nancial holding 
companies are subject were implemented by the Federal Reserve. In 2008,

these newly proposed requirements. Regardless, complying with these 
new capital requirements will likely affect our operations, and the extent to 
which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional 
clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements. 
These new requirements have been endorsed by the U.S. banking 
regulators, but have not yet been translated by the regulators into ofﬁ cial 
regulation for U.S. ﬁ It is anticipated that the regulators 
will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed 
by the BCBS, and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased-in 
for U.S. ﬁ nancial institutions beginning in 2013. It is widely anticipated that 
the capital requirements for most bank and ﬁ nancial holding companies, 
as well as for most insured depository institutions, will increase, although 
the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been speciﬁ ed.

Synovus Bank’s Capital Requirements
To be well-capitalized, Synovus Bank must generally maintain a Total 
Capital (the sum of T1 Capital and Tpercent or 
greater, a Tpercent or greater, and a leverage ratio of 
percent or greater. For the purposes of these tests, T1 Capital consists 
of common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying 
preferred stock, less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles. T2 
Capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, certain types of debt 
and the eligible portion of the allowance for loan losses.In measuring the adequacy of capital, assets are weighted for risk at rates 
that generally range from zerperpercent. Certain assets, 
such as most cash instruments and U.S. Treasury securities, have a zero 
risk weighting. Others, such as certain commercial and consumer loans, 
percent risk weighting. Risk weightings are also assigned 
for off-balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments. The 
various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk-weighting to determine 
risk-adjusted assets for the capital calculations. For the leverage ratio 
mentioned above, assets are not risk-weighted.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act established a 
system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized 
insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators 
are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of ﬁ ve capital 
categories as described below. The federal banking regulators are also 
required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take 
other discretionary actions, with respect to insured depository institutions in 
the three undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend upon 
the capital category in which the insured depository institution is assigned. 
Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act requires the banking regulator to appoint a 
receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution that is critically 
undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have speciﬁ ed by regulation 
the relevant capital level for each category. Under the regulations, all insured 
depository institutions are assigned to one of the following capital categories:
 •W- The insured depository institution exceeds the required 
minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized 
insurhaving a total risk-based capital 
percent or greaterhaving a T1 risk-based capital ratio

required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized

cent.
 •Critically Under- The insured depository institution fails to 
meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. 
A critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible

The regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to 
downgrade an institution to the next lower category if the regulator 
determines after notice and opportunity for hearing or response that the 
is in an unsafe or unsound condition or (2) has received and not 
corrected a less-than-satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset 
quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination. 
Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend 
upon an institution’s classiﬁ cation within the ﬁ ve categories. Our management 
believes that we and our bank subsidiary have the requisite capital 
levels to qualify as well capitalized institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act r14 of Notes 
If an institution fails to remain well-capitalized, it will be subject to a variety 
of enforcement remedies that increase as the capital condition worsens. 
For instance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement 
Act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital 
distribution, including payment of a dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be 
undercapitalized as a result. See “- Dividends.” Undercapitalized depository 
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal 
Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may 
not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject 
to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
for regulatory approval. A depository institution’s holding company must 
guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to 
cent of the depository institution’s assets at the time it 
becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deﬁ ciency when 
the institution fails to comply with the plan. Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the 
plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring 
the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit 
an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is signiﬁ cantly undercapitalized.
Signiﬁ cantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a 
number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufﬁ cient 
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce 
total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent 
banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to 
appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Deposit Insurance and AssessmentsDeposits at our bank are insured by the DIF as administered by the 
FDIC, up to the applicable limits established by law. The Dodd-Frank Act 
amended the statutory regime governing the DIF. Among other things, the 
Dodd-Frank Act established a minimum designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) 
percent of estimated insured deposits, required that the fund 
reserve ratio rper2020 and directed the 
FDIC to amend its regulations to redeﬁ ne the assessment base used for 
calculating deposit insurance assessments. Speciﬁ cally, the Dodd-Frank 
Act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average 
consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during 
the assessment period, minus the sum of the average tangible equity 
of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and 
an amount the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk-based assessment system found in the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act.of 2010, the FDIC adopted a ﬁ nal rule setting the DRR at 
percent. Furthermor2011, the FDIC issued a ﬁ nal rule

insured depository institution where the debt is issued by another insured

assessment rates will vary depending on the DIF reserve ratio. For example, 
for banks in the best risk category, the total base assessment rates will

perpercent, between 1 and 6 basis points when 
the DIF rperpercent and between 
0.5 and 5 basis points when the DIF rpercent or higher.
In addition, the FDIC collects FICO deposit assessments, which is calculated 
off of the new assessment base established by the Dodd-Frank Act. FICO 
assessments are set quarterly, and in 2011 ranged from 1.020 (annual) 
basis points in the ﬁ rst quarter to .680 (annual) basis points in the second, 
third and fourth quarters. Synovus Bank pays the deposit insurance

With respect to brokered deposits, an insured depository institution must 
be well-capitalized in order to accept, renew or roll over such deposits

institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC in order to accept, renew or 
roll over brokered deposits. Undercapitalized insured depository institutions 
generally may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. See the

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report.Dodd-Frank Act; Future Changes to Legal 
Framework2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which will substantially change the regulatory framework under which we

signiﬁ cant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the ﬁ nancial-services 
industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, 
deposit insurance assessments, consumer ﬁ nancial protection, interchange 
fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of 
investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. 
Among the provisions that may affect the operations of Synovus or Synovus 
Bank are the following:
 •Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and 
enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.

 PAR 
 •New limitations on federal preemption.
 •New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and 
nonbank ﬁ nancial company to engage in proprietary trading and have 
certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.
 •Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to 
leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components 
of permissible tiered capital.
 •Requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized 
and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for ﬁ nancial 
holding companies. •Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.
 •Permanently raising the FDIC’s standard maximum insurance amount 
to $250,000 and, thr2012, providing unlimited 
insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts.
 •Repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, 
ef2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay 
interest on business transaction and other accounts.
 •Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk by taking 
covered ﬁ nancial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that 
may lead to material losses. •Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities rpercentage 
of the credit risk underlying the securities.
 •Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements 
of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them 
with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness.
Some of these and other major changes, such as the planned expiration 
of the unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand 
2012, could materially impact the 
proﬁ tability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral 
available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force 
us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these provisions 
became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others 
are subject to further study, rule-making, and the discretion of regulatory 
bodies. In light of these signiﬁ cant changes and the discretion afforded to 
federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with 
the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on Synovus’ 
businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional 
regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely 
affect Synovus’ business, ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations. See 
- Regulation of the ﬁ nancial services industry 
is undergoing major changes, and future legislation could increase our 
cost of doing business or harm our competitive position” of this Report.Additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are 
frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood, 
timing, and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty.
Consumer Protection Regulations
Retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations 
designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or 
contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws 
concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to federal laws 
applicable to credit transactions, such as:
 •the federal Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer 
borrowers;
 •the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board, requiring ﬁ nancial institutions to provide information to 
enable the public and public ofﬁ cials to determine whether a ﬁ nancial 
institution is fulﬁ lling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of 
the community it serves; •the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or 
other prohibited factors in extending credit;
 •the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board, governing the use and provision of information to 
consumer reporting agencies;
 •the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer 
debts may be collected by collection agencies; and •the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility 
of implementing such federal laws.Deposit operations also are subject to:
 •the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD issued by the Federal Reserve 
Board, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;
 •Regulation CC issued by the Federal Reserve Board, which relates to 
the availability of deposit funds to consumers; •the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the 
conﬁ dentiality of consumer ﬁ nancial records and prescribes procedures 
for complying with administrative subpoenas of ﬁ nancial records; and
 •the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal 
Reserve Board, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals 
from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the 
use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
In addition, there are a number of signiﬁ cant consumer protection standards 
that apply to functional areas of operation (rather than applying only to 
loan or deposit pr2010, the Federal Reserve 
issued a ﬁ nal rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees 
and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. 
The Federal Reserve and FDIC also recently enacted consumer protection 
regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by 
ﬁ nancial institutions. The FDIC has also issued rules aimed at protecting 
consumer in connection with retail foreign exchange transactions. In 
addition, the Federal Reserve has been actively revising Regulation E, which 
governs electronic transactions, including a recent proposal governing 
remittance transfer transactions. Among the ﬁ nalized changes made to 
2009 amendment, which prohibits ﬁ nancial 
institutions, including Synovus Bank, from charging consumers fees for 
paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card 
transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service 
for those types of transactions. Regulation E amendments also require 
ﬁ nancial institutions to provide consumers with a notice that explains the 
ﬁ nancial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with 
the service and the consumer’s choices. The amendments to Regulation 
E became ef
2010, the FDIC supplemented the Regulation E amendments 
by requiring FDIC-supervised institutions, including Synovus Bank, to 
implement additional changes relating to automated overdraft payment 
pr2011. The most signiﬁ cant of these changes require 
ﬁ nancial institutions to monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive 
or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-
up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times 
during a rolling 12-month period. The additional guidance also imposes 
daily limits on overdraft charges, requires institutions to review and modify 
check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from 
available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased board and 
management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs.
Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting 
from the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for 
revisions to implementing regulations. In addition, oversight responsibilities

in the near term. We cannot predict the effect that being regulated by 
a new, additional regulatory authority focused on consumer ﬁ nancial 
protection, or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing

Anti-Money Laundering; USA PATRIOT Act; 
Ofﬁ
 ce of Foreign Assets Control
Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that 
include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated 
compliance ofﬁ cer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing 
of the program by an independent audit function. We are prohibited from 
entering into speciﬁ ed ﬁ nancial transactions and account relationships and 
must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign 
ﬁ nancial institutions and foreign customers. We also must take reasonable 
steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard 
against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. 
Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access 
to ﬁ nancial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering 
obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA 
PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006. Bank regulators 
routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and 
are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory 
review of applications.
The USA PATRIOT Act amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides 
for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and 
ﬁ nancial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money 
laundering. The statute also creates enhanced information collection 
tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: 
requiring standards for verifying customer identiﬁ cation at account 
omulgating rules to promote cooperation among ﬁ nancial 
institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties 
that may be involved in terrrequiring reports 
by nonﬁ nancial trades and businesses ﬁ led with the Treasury’s Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and 
mandating the ﬁ ling of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes 
a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations. The statute also 
requires enhanced due diligence requirements for ﬁ nancial institutions that 
administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent 
accounts for non-U.S. persons.The Federal Bureau of Investigation may send bank regulatory agencies 
lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. 
Our banks can be requested to search their records for any relationships 
or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report 
any identiﬁ ed relationships or transactions. Furthermore, the Ofﬁ ce of 
Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure 
that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited 
parties, as deﬁ ned by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. 
OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and 
organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, 
including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If we ﬁ nd a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an 
OFAC list, we must freeze such account, ﬁ le a suspicious activity report 
and notify the appropriate authorities.
Commitments to Synovus BankUnder the Federal Reserve Board’s policy, we are expected to serve as a 
source of ﬁ nancial strength to Synovus Bank and to commit resources to 
support Synovus Bank in circumstances when we might not do so absent 
such policy. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve 
Board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or 
relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary, other than a nonbank subsidiary 
of a bank, upon the Federal Reserve Board’s determination that such 
activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the ﬁ nancial soundness or 
stability of any depository institution subsidiary. Further, the Federal Reserve 
Board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself 
of any bank or non-bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution’s ﬁ nancial condition. In 
addition, any capital loans by us to Synovus Bank would be subordinate 
in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act codiﬁ ed the Federal Reserve’s 
“source of strength” doctrine; this statutory change became effective 
2011. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Dodd-Frank 
Act’s new provisions authorize the Federal Reserve to require a company 
that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed 
both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its “source 
of strength” obligations and to enforce the company’s compliance with 
these obligations. As of the date of this Report, the Federal Reserve and 
other federal banking regulators have not yet issued rules implementing 
this requirement, which ar
If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation 
process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a 
federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Synovus Bank 
would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, 
and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any 
insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred 
by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided 
by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. 
Synovus Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject 
to these requirements.
Transactions with Afﬁ
 liates and InsidersA variety of legal limitations restrict our subsidiary bank from lending or 
otherwise supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with us or our non-bank subsidiaries. Synovus Bank is subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W.23A places limits on the amount of “covered transactions,” 
which include loans or extensions of credit to, investments in or certain 
other transactions with, afﬁ liates as well as the amount of advances to 
third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of afﬁ liates. The 
aggregate of all coverpercent of the bank’s 
capital and surplus for any one afﬁ percent for all afﬁ liates. 
Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered 
transaction must meet speciﬁ ed collateral requirements ranging from 100 
percent. Also, the bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality 
assets from any of its afﬁ 608 of the Dodd-Frank Act broadens 
the deﬁ nition of “covered transactions” to include derivative transactions 
and the borrowing or lending of securities if the transaction will cause a 
bank to have credit exposure to an afﬁ liate. The revised deﬁ nition also 
includes the acceptance of debt obligations of an afﬁ liate as collateral 
for a loan or extension of credit to a third-party. Furthermore, reverse 
repurchase transactions will be viewed as extensions of credit (instead 
of asset purchases) and thus become subject to collateral requirements. 
These expanded deﬁ nitions take ef
23B, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging 
in certain transactions with afﬁ liates unless the transactions are on terms 
substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing 
at the time for comparable transactions with nonafﬁ liated companies. 
Except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that 
are deemed to be unsafe or unsound, Regulation W generally excludes 
20.
 PAR 
afﬁ liated depository institutions from treatment as afﬁ liates. Transactions 
between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain 
ﬁ nancial activities may be subject to the afﬁ liated transaction limits. The 
Federal Reserve Board also may designate bank subsidiaries as afﬁ liates.
Banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit 
to executive ofﬁ cers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related 
interests. In general, such extensions of crmay not exceed certain 
must be made on substantially the same terms, 
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for 
comparable transactions with thirmust not involve more 
than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank’s board 
of directors.
Regulatory ExaminationsFederal and state banking agencies require us and our subsidiary bank 
to prepare annual reports on ﬁ nancial condition and to conduct an annual 
audit of ﬁ nancial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and 
procedures. Synovus Bank, and in some cases we and our nonbank 
afﬁ liates, must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate 
regulatory agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal 
and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting 
an examination has complete access to the books and records of the 
examined institution. The results of the examination are conﬁ dential. The 
cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate.
Community Reinvestment ActThe Community Reinvestment Act requires the FDIC to evaluate the 
record of Synovus Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, 
including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to 
open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could 
result in additional requirements and limitations on the bank.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans 
are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. The regulators 
have advised ﬁ nancial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate 
lending concentrations. Such loans generally include land development, 
construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property, and nonfarm, 
nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived 
from rental income associated with the property. The guidance prescribes the 
following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially 
exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:
 •total reported loans for construction, land development and other land 
reprcent or more of the institutions total capital, or
 •total commercial real estate loans reprpercent or more of the 
institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s 
commercial real estate loan portfolio has incrpercent or 
mor
2009, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance 
on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may impact our 
business by reducing the amount of our commercial real estate lending 
and increasing the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk 
r941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, 
among other things, a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed 
securities to rpercentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. 
The banking agencies have jointly issued a proposed rule to implement 
these requirements but have yet to issue ﬁ nal rules.
BranchingThe Dodd-Frank Act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities. Formerly, under the 
Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efﬁ ciency Act of 1994, a 
bank’s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon 
whether the state “opted in” to 
de novo
 interstate branching. Many states 
did not “opt-in,” which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. 
The Dodd-Frank Act removed the “opt-in” concept and permits banks to 
engage in de novo branching outside of their home states, provided that 
the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch 
within that state. Accordingly, 
de novo interstate branching by Synovus Bank is subject to these new standards. All branching in which Synovus 
Bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence 
to applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Anti-Tying Restrictions
In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish 
any services or ﬁ x or vary the consideration for them on the condition that 
the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or 
services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries, 
the customer not obtain some other credit, property, or services from 
a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to 
assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may, however, offer 
combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms 
if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. Also, certain 
foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule.
Privacy and Credit Reporting
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting 
and protecting conﬁ dential customer information. Customers generally 
may prevent ﬁ nancial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal ﬁ nancial 
information with nonafﬁ liated third parties, with some exceptions, such 
as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer. Financial 
institutions generally may not disclose certain consumer or account 
information to any nonafﬁ liated third-party for use in telemarketing, direct 
mail marketing or other marketing. Federal and state banking agencies 
have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and conﬁ dentiality 
of consumer information, and we are subject to such standards, as well 
as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in 

the event of a security breach.
Synovus Bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities. Use of 
such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation 
V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, 
and sharing of information between afﬁ liates and the use of credit data. 
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are 
not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act.
Enforcement Powers
Synovus Bank and its “institution-afﬁ liated parties,” including management, 
employees, agents, independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of 
the institution’s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties 
for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a government agency. 
Violations can include failure to timely ﬁ le required reports, ﬁ ling false or 
misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may 
be as high as $1,000,000 a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some ﬁ years. 
Regulators have ﬂ exibility to commence enforcement actions against 
institutions and institution-afﬁ liated parties, and the FDIC has the authority 
to terminate deposit insurance. When issued by a banking agency, cease-
and-desist and similar orders may, among other things, require afﬁ rmative 
action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including 
21.
 PAR 
restitution, reimbursement, indemniﬁ cations or guarantees against loss. 
A ﬁ nancial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose 
of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions 
determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency. The federal banking 
agencies also may remove a director or ofﬁ cer from an insured depository 
institution (or bar them from the industry) if a violation is willful or reckless.
We have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Georgia Commissioner, pursuant to 
which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to, among other 
things, minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our distressed 
assets, limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate 
loans, improve our credit risk management and related policies and 
procedures, address liquidity management and current and future capital 
requirements, strengthen enterprise risk management practices, and 
provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management 
positions. Additionally, Synovus Bank is presently subject to a memorandum 
of understanding with the Georgia Commissioner and the FDIC that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company 
memorandum of understanding described above and, as a result of 
recent compliance exams, Synovus Bank has entered into an informal 
written agreement with the FDIC relating to certain compliance matters. 
- We are presently subject to, and in 
the future may become subject to, additional supervisory actions and/
or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our 
business, reputation, operating ﬂ exibility, ﬁ nancial condition and the value 
of our Common Stock” of this Report.Monetary Policy and Economic Controls
The earnings of Synovus Bank, and therefore our earnings, are affected 
by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of 
the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve 
Board is to promote orderly economic growth by inﬂ uencing interest 
rates and the supply of money and credit. Among the methods that 
have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations 
in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate for bank 
borrowings, expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in 
reserve requirements against bank deposits. These methods are used in 
varying combinations to inﬂ uence overall growth and distribution of bank 
loans, investments and deposits, interest rates on loans and securities, 
and rates paid for deposits. Recently, in response to the ﬁ nancial crisis, 
the Federal Reserve Board has created several innovative programs to 
stabilize certain ﬁ nancial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit.
The effects of the various Federal Reserve Board policies on our future 
business and earnings cannot be predicted. We cannot predict the nature 
or extent of any effects that possible future governmental controls or 
legislation might have on our business and earnings.
Depositor Preference Statute
Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative 
expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository 
institution are afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against 
such institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the liquidation 
or other resolution of the institution by any receiver.

and conditions on participants in the CPP. As a participant in the CPP,

EESA, as amended by ARRA, regarding compensation and corporate 
governance restrictions that would be imposed on TARP recipients,

of our executives, consistent with regulations promulgated by the SEC. 
2010, the SEC adopted ﬁ nal regulations setting forth the 
parameters for such say-on pay proposals for public company TARP 
participants. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act contains separate requirements 
relating to compensation arrangement. Speciﬁ cally, the Act requires banking 
regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by 
providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material loss at 
certain ﬁ billion or more in assets. A proposed 
2011, however, 
regulators have yet to issue ﬁ nal rules on the topic.
Additional regulations applicable to TARP recipients adopted as part of 
EESA, the Financial Stability Plan, ARRA, or other legislation may subject us to additional regulatory requirements. The impact of these additional 
requirements may put us at competitive disadvantage in comparison 
to ﬁ nancial institutions that have either repaid all TARP funds or never 
accepted TARP funds and may materially adversely affect our business 
and results of operations.
Capital Purchase Program
Treasury, or Treasury, announced that, 
pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, it was implementing 
a voluntary program known as the “Capital Purchase Program”, or “CPP”, 
pursuant to which eligible ﬁ nancial institutions could raise capital by selling 
preferred stock dirGovernment. The purpose of the 
Capital Purchase Prﬁ nancial institutions 
to build capital to, among other things, increase the ﬂ ow of ﬁ nancing to

Treasury to do so, we may be obligated to ﬁ le a registration statement

restrictions on executive compensation that could limit the tax deductibility 
of compensation we pay to executive management. See “- Supervision, - TARP Regulations” for a more detailed 
description of the compensation and corporate governance restrictions 
that are applicable to us and other CPP participants.
To date, we have utilized our CPP capital to contribute capital to Synovus

Synovus Bank. The CPP capital we received has facilitated the ability 
of Synovus Bank and its predecessors to continue to extend loans to 
customers in its local banking communities.Other Regulatory MattersSynovus and its subsidiaries and afﬁ liates are subject to numerous 
examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC,

Synovus and its subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for 
information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state 
insurance commissions and state attorneys general, securities regulators

The current and further deterioration in the residential construction and commercial development real estate 
markets may lead to increased non-performing assets 
in our loan portfolio and increased provision for loan 
losses for losses on loans, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.Since the third quarter of 2007, the residential construction and commercial 
development real estate markets have experienced a variety of difﬁ culties and 
challenging economic conditions. Our non-performing assets werbillion 
2011, compar2010 and 
2009. While recent economic data suggests 
that overall economic conditions are improving, if market conditions remain 
poor or further deteriorate, they may lead to additional valuation adjustments 
on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the 
fair value of our non-performing assets, the loss severities of loans in default, 
and the fair value of real estate owned. We also may realize additional losses 
in connection with our disposition of distressed assets. Poor economic 
conditions could result in decreased demand for residential housing, which, 
in turn, could adversely affect the development and construction efforts of 
residential real estate developers. Consequently, such economic downturns 
could adversely affect the ability of such residential real estate developer 
borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral 
for such loans. A sustained weak economy could also result in higher 
levels of non-performing loans in other categories, such as commercial 
and industrial loans, which may result in additional losses. Management 
continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout 
our footprint for indications of change in other markets. If these economic 
conditions and market factors negatively and/or disproportionately affect 
some of our larger loans, then we could see a sharp increase in our total 
net-charge offs and also be required to signiﬁ cantly increase our allowance 
for loan losses. Any further increase in our non-performing assets and 
related increases in our provision for loan losses for losses on loans could 
negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on 
our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate 
to cover actual losses, and we may be required to 
materially increase our allowance, which may adversely 
affect our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established 
through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents 
management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been 
incurr7 
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and under 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations” of this Report. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks 
inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of 
the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity 
and requires us to make signiﬁ cant estimates of current credit risks using 
existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, 
new information regarding existing loans, identiﬁ cation of additional 
problem loans, risk ratings, and other factors, both within and outside 
of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.
Because the risk rating of the loans is inherently subjective and subject to 
changes in the borrower’s credit risk proﬁ le, evolving local market conditions 
and other factors, it can be difﬁ cult for us to predict the effects that those 
factors will have on the classiﬁ cations assigned to the loan portfolio, and 
thus difﬁ cult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans 
through the classiﬁ cation process and effect on the level of the allowance 
for loan losses. Accordingly, we monitor our credit quality and our reserve 
requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other 
purposes. See “Liquidity” and “Capital Resour7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations” of this Report.In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for 
loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or 
the recognition of additional loan charge offs, based on judgments different 
than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses 
results in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material 
adverse effect on our capital, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
In light of current market conditions, we regularly reassess the creditworthiness 
of our borrowers and the sufﬁ ciency of our allowance for loan losses. Our 
million, or 2.67% of total loans

additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic assumptions as well as changes 
in assumptions regarding a borrower’s ability to pay and/or collateral 
values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of 
their examination procedures, periodically review the allowance. Based 
on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, such agencies may require Synovus to recognize additions 
to the allowance. We recorded a provision for loan losses during the year 
million comparbillion 
pr2010, both of 
which are signiﬁ cantly higher than historical levels. We also charged-off 
apprmillion in loans, net of recoveries, during the year 
2011, comparbillion in loans, net of 
r2010, both of which 
were also signiﬁ cantly higher than in previous periods.
Even though our credit trends showed improvement during 2011 compared 
years, we expect that our levels of non-performing assets 
will remain at elevated levels in the foreseeable future as the deterioration 
in the credit and real estate markets causes borrowers to default. Further, 
the value of the collateral underlying a given loan, and the realizable value 
of such collateral in a foreclosure sale, likely will be negatively affected 
by the downturn in the real estate market, and therefore may result in 
an inability to realize a full recovery in the event that a borrower defaults 
on a loan. In addition, as we execute our previously announced strategy 
to dispose of distressed assets, we will realize additional future losses 
if the proceeds we receive upon disposition of assets are less than the 
recorded carrying value of such assets. Any additional non-performing 
assets, loan charge-offs, increases in the provision for loan losses or any 
inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event 
of a loan default, could negatively affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition, 
and results of operations and the price of our securities.
We will realize additional future losses if our levels of 
non-performing assets do not moderate and if the 
proceeds we receive upon liquidation of assets are less 
than the carrying value of such assets.
In 2009, we announced a strategy to aggressively dispose of non-performing 
assets. During 2011, we completed sales of apprmillion 
of distressed assets, and we sold apprbillion of distressed 
assets in each of 2009 and 2010. We presently expect to continue our 
sales of distressed assets during 2012. The actual volume of future 
distressed asset sales could increase based on regulatory directives, the 
level of migration of performing loans to problem loan status, as well as 
opportunities to sell such assets, thus resulting in higher credit costs. 
Conversely, the continuing weakness in the residential and commercial real 
estate markets may negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed 
assets, and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets. 
Non-performing assets are recorded on our ﬁ nancial statements at the 
estimated fair value, which considers management’s plans for disposition. 
We will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon 
dispositions of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such 
assets. If market conditions continue to decline, the magnitude of losses we 
may realize upon the disposition of non-performing assets may increase, 
which could materially adversely affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition 
and results of operations.

We may not realize the expected beneﬁ
 ts from our 2010 strategic plan and our 2011 efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives.In the second half of 2010 Synovus announced an update of its three-year 
strategic plan to address the challenges facing Synovus and deﬁ ne strategies 
for expense reduction, streamlining of processes and long-term growth 
initiatives. The plan’s key strategic elements are focused on the following areas:
 •enhancing the sales and service approach for targeted customer segments;
 •aligning the cost structure with the current size of the organization; and
 •enhancing the customer experience by streamlining processes.
The plan’s stated goals include signiﬁ cant declines in non-performing 
assets and potential problem loan levels, a further reduction in CRE loan 
concentration, and substantial growth in the C&I loan portfolio. The goals 
also include substantial cost reductions and capital ratios that exceed 
regulatory requirements and position Synovus favorably among its peers.
2011, Synovus identiﬁ ed and announced a series of efﬁ ciency and 
growth initiatives implementing the updated strategic plan, including the following:
 •efﬁ million in 
annual expense savings by the end of 2012; •enhancements to Synovus’ Large Corporate Banking initiative; and •streamlining of processes and enhanced product offerings and technology 
to improve the customer experience and reduce operating inefﬁ ciencies.
In 2011, through execution of these initiatives, Synovus realized a 
million, or 10.5%, reduction in total non-interest expense, and a 
million or 11.7% reduction in core non-interest expense. However, the 
estimates and assumptions in the strategic plan and the related operating 
plan and restructuring of Synovus’ cost base may or may not prove to be 
accurate in some respects, and there can be no assurance that Synovus will 
ultimately realize the full beneﬁ ts of the strategic plan or be able to sustain 
the annual cost savings anticipated by the plan. In addition, Synovus is subject to various risks inherent in its business. These risks may cause the 
anticipated results from our strategic plan and cost-reduction initiatives 
to result in implementation charges beyond those currently contemplated 
or could result in some other unanticipated adverse impact. Furthermore, 
the implementation of these initiatives may have unintended impacts 
on Synovus’ ability to attract and retain business and customers, while 
revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace or 
may result in unintended costs. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the 
anticipated long-term beneﬁ ts from our strategic plan and cost reduction 
initiatives will be realized, and we may be unable to execute our business 
strategy and achieve our strategic and ﬁ nancial objectives.
If economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital 
rules are modiﬁ ed, we may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital 
position.During 2009 and 2010, Synovus executed a number of strategic capital initiatives to bolster our capital position against credit deterioration and 
to provide additional capital as Synovus pursued its aggressive asset 
disposition strategy2011, Synovus’ T1 capital ratio 
was 12.94%, its T1 Common Equity Ratio was 8.49%, and Synovus and 
Synovus Bank were considered “well capitalized” under current regulatory 
standar- Business, Supervision, Regulation and 
- Prompt Corrective Action” of this Report for a discussion 
of the deﬁ nition of “well capitalized.” This regulatory capital framework is 
expected to change in important respects as a result of the Dodd-Frank 
Act and a separate, international regulatory capital initiative known as 
III.” In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates T1 capital treatment 
for most trust preferred securities after a three-year phase-in period that 
2013. Furthermor2010, BCBS ﬁ nalized 
new regulatory capital standarIII, which are aimed 
at capital reform, seek to further strengthen ﬁ nancial institutions’ capital 
positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held, along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of 
stress. At present, our T1 common equity is in excess of the minimum 
common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly 
proposed requirements. Regardless, complying with these new capital 
requirements will likely affect our operations, and the extent to which we 
will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity 
is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements. These 
new requirements have been endorsed by the U.S. banking regulators, 
but have not yet been translated by the regulators into ofﬁ cial regulation 
for U.S. ﬁ It is anticipated that the regulators will adopt 
new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS 
and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased-in for U.S. ﬁ nancial 
institutions beginning in 2013. It is widely anticipated that the new capital requirements brought about by the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act 
III for most bank and ﬁ nancial holding companies, as well as 
for most insured depository institutions, will increase, although the nature 
and amounts of the increase have not yet been speciﬁ ed.
In addition, reﬂ ecting the importance that regulators place on managing 
2011, the banking agencies issued 
proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more 
billion in total consolidated assets; this proposed guidance 
outlines four “high-level” principles for stress testing practices that should 
be a part of a banking organization’s stress-testing framework. Speciﬁ cally, 
the guidance calls for the framework to (1) include activities and exercises 
that are tailored to the activities of the organization; (2) employ multiple 
conceptually sound activities and approaches; (3) be forward-looking 
and ﬂ exible; and (4) be clear, actionable, well-supported, and used in the 
decision-making process. Moreover, the federal bank regulators have 
issued a series of guidance and rulemakings applicable to “large banks.” While many of these do not currently apply us due to our asset size, these 
issuances could impact industry capital standards and practices in many, 
potentially unforeseeable ways.
Synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry 
capital standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, 
and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at 
both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with any future repayment of Synovus’ 
obligations under the CPP. If economic conditions or other factors worsen to 
a materially greater degree than the assumptions underlying management’s 
current internal assessment of our capital position or if minimum regulatory 
capital requirements for us or Synovus Bank increase as the result of 
legislative changes or informal or formal regulatory directives, then we 
would be required to pursue one or more additional capital improvement 
strategies, including, among others, balance sheet optimization strategies, 
asset sales, and/or the sale of securities to one or more third parties. 
Given the current economic and market conditions and our ﬁ nancial 
performance and related credit ratings, there can be no assurance that any 
such transactions will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that we would be able to realize the anticipated beneﬁ ts of such transactions. 
We also cannot predict the effect that these transactions would have on 
the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, if we issue additional equity securities in these transactions, including options, warrants, preferred 
stock or convertible securities, such newly issued securities could cause signiﬁ cant dilution to the holders of our Common Stock.
Further adverse changes in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital 
markets.During the past thryears, our long-term debt has been downgraded 
to below investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard and 
Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. The ratings agencies regularly 
evaluate us and Synovus Bank, and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our ﬁ nancial strength as well 
as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the 
ﬁ nancial services industry generally. In light of the continuing difﬁ culties in 
the ﬁ nancial services industry and the housing and ﬁ nancial markets, there

 PAR 
can be no assurance that we will not receive additional adverse changes 
in our ratings, which could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon 
which we are able to obtain funding and the way in which we are perceived 
in the capital markets. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under 
review for a downgrade, could affect the market value and liquidity of our 
outstanding public indebtedness and increase our borrowing costs. We 
cannot predict whether existing customer relationships or opportunities for 
future relationships could be further affected by customers who choose to 
do business with a higher rated institution. We may be unable to access 
historical and alternative sources of liquidity, which could adversely affect 
our overall liquidity. Liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily 
available sources of funding needed to meet the needs of our depositors, 
borrowers and creditors; to support asset growth; fund deposit withdrawals; 
to maintain reserve requirements, and to otherwise sustain our operations 
and the operations of our subsidiary bank. For Synovus Bank, the primary 
source of liquidity is the growth and retention of deposits. In the current 
competitive environment, customer conﬁ dence is a critical element in 
growing and retaining deposits. In this regard, Synovus Bank’s asset quality 
could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base. In the event 
asset quality declines signiﬁ cantly from its current level, Synovus Bank’s 
ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished.
We must maintain adequate liquidity at the Parent Company level for various 
operating needs, including the servicing of debt, the payment of general corporate expenses, and the payment of dividends to shareholders. In 
addition to our ordinary course liquidity needs, current conditions in the public 
markets for bank holding companies, dividend payments on our Common 
A Preferred Stock, and capital needs of Synovus Bank 
during the ﬁ nancial crisis have put additional pressure on our liquidity. The 
primary source of liquidity at the holding company level is dividends from 
Synovus Bank. During 2011, Synovus did not receive any dividends from 
Synovus Bank. Synovus Bank is currently subject to a memorandum of 
understanding that prohibits it from paying any cash dividends to us without 
regulatory approval, and other GA DBF rules and related statutes contain 
additional restrictions on payments of dividends by Synovus Bank. See 
- 
Dividends.” Synovus may not receive dividends from Synovus Bank in 
2012, which could adversely affect liquidity. Synovus’ ability to receive 
dividends from Synovus Bank in future periods will depend on a number of 
factors, including, without limitation, Synovus’ Bank’s future proﬁ ts, asset 
quality and overall ﬁ nancial condition. In addition to dividends from Synovus 
Bank, we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources 
of liquidity, including the capital markets, but there is no assurance that 
we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or 
at all. If our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity 
is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms and we continue to experience increased demand for liquidity at the holding company level 
then our overall liquidity and ﬁ nancial condition will be adversely affected.
We may be unable to pay dividends on our Common 
Stock.Although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our Common Stock, holders of our Common Stock are not legally 
entitled to receive dividends. The reduction or elimination of dividends 
paid on our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of 
our Common Stock. In addition, the Federal Reserve could decide at 
any time that paying any Common Stock dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Any of these decisions could adversely 
affect the market price of our Common Stock. For a discussion of current

Our net interest income could be negatively affected 
by the lower level of short-term interest rates and a 
decrease in total loans.Net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income 
that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we 
pay on interest-bearing liabilities, is a major component of our income. Our 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue from our operations. 
The Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates on three occasions 
basis 
points, to a range of 0% to 0.25%, during 2008. Interest rates during 
2010 and 2011 have remained at the range of 0% to 0.25% as set 
by the Federal Reserve during 2008. A signiﬁ cant portion of our loans, 
including residential construction and development loans and other 
commercial loans, bear interest at variable rates. In addition, in order to 
compete for deposits in our primary market areas, we may offer more 
attractive interest rates to depositors, or we may have to pursue other 
sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds.
Our total loans decr2011 
compar2010. A decrease in loans 
outstanding and lower realized yields on investment securities reduced 
our net inter2011 and 
could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods. 
This reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the 
high level of competition that we face in our primary market area. Any 
signiﬁ cant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our 
business and could have a material adverse impact on our capital, ﬁ nancial 
condition and results of operations.
Changes in the cost and availability of funding due to 
changes in the deposit market and credit market, or 
the way in which we are perceived in such markets, 
may adversely affect our capital resources, liquidity and 
ﬁ nancial results.In managing our consolidated balance sheet, we depend on access 
to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufﬁ cient capital 
resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, 
and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Sources of funding available to us, and upon which we 
rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management 
strategy, include borrowings from the FHLB and brokered deposits. See 
“Liquidity” and “Capital Resour7. Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report. We also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the 
capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short- or long-term borrowings or equity issuances. If, due to market 
disruptions, perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors, we are 
unable to access the capital markets in the future, our capital resources 
and liquidity may be adversely affected.
In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including from other 
ﬁ nancial institutions, the capital markets and deposits, directly impacts our 
costs in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore, can 
positively or negatively affect our ﬁ nancial results. A number of factors could 
make funding more difﬁ cult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, 
including, but not limited to, further reductions in our debt ratings, ﬁ nancial 
results and losses, changes within our organization, speciﬁ c events that 
adversely impact our reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, speciﬁ c 
events that adversely impact the ﬁ nancial services industry, counterparty 
availability, changes affecting our assets, the corporate and regulatory 
structure, interest rate ﬂ uctuations, general economic conditions and the 
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing our funding 
transactions. Also, we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies, many of which are substantially larger, and have more capital 
and other resources than we do. In addition, as some of these competitors 
consolidate with other ﬁ nancial institutions, these advantages may increase. 
Competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds.

We may not be able to generate sufﬁ
 cient cash to service all of our debt.
2011, Synovus and its consolidated subsidiaries had 
billion of long-term debt outstanding. In February 2012, we issued 
million of long-term debt and announced a tender offer 
million of our existing subordinated notes due in 2013. Our 
ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy 
our obligations in respect of our debt, to reﬁ nance our debt or to fund 
capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance. 
Prevailing economic conditions (including interest rates), regulatory 
constraints, including, among other things, on distributions to us from 
our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to certain of our 
banking and insurance subsidiaries, and ﬁ nancial, business and other 
factors, many of which are beyond our control, will also affect our ability to 
meet these needs. We may not be able to generate sufﬁ cient cash ﬂ ows 
from operations, or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufﬁ cient to 
enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may 
need to reﬁ nance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may 
not be able to reﬁ nance any of our debt when needed on commercially 
reasonable terms or at all.

382 generally occurs when a change 
in the aggrpercentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held 
by “ﬁ percent shareholders” increases by more than ﬁ percentage points

change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre-

the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the “ownership

2010, we adopted a shareholder rights plan, which provides an 
economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in concert to 
become an owner, for relevant tax purposes, of 5% or more of our stock. 
While adoption of the rights plan should reduce the likelihood that future 
transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change, there can be no 
assurance that the Rights Plan will be effective to deter a stockholder from 
increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the Rights Plan 
or that an ownership change will not occur in the future. Furthermore, our 
ability to enter into future transactions may be impaired if such transactions

382 were to occur, the value of our net 
operating losses and a portion of the net unrealized built-in losses will be 
impaired. Because a valuation allowance currently exists for substantially 
the full amount of our deferred tax assets, no additional charge to earnings 
would result. However, an “ownership change”, as deﬁ ned above, could 
adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset in the future.
We presently are subject to, and in the future may 
become subject to, supervisory actions and enhanced 

regulation that could have a material negative effect on 
our business, reputation, operating ﬂ exibility, ﬁ
 nancial condition and the value of our Common Stock.Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and 
soundness of insured depository institutions, state banking regulators, the 
Federal Reserve, and separately the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, 
each has the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if 
any of them determine that we have insufﬁ cient capital or are otherwise 
operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe 
and sound banking practices. In addition to examinations for safety and 
soundness, Synovus and its subsidiaries also are subject to continuous 
examination by state and federal banking regulators, including the newly 
formed CFPB, for compliance with various laws and regulations, as well 
as consumer compliance initiatives. As a result of this regulatory oversight 
and examination process, our regulators can require us to enter into GA 
DBF informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, 
memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease 
and desist orders, pursuant to which we could be required to take identiﬁ ed 
corrective actions to address cited concerns, or to refrain from taking 
certain actions.We entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the GA DBF pursuant to which we agreed to 
implement plans that are intended to, among other things, minimize credit 
losses and reduce the amount of our distressed assets, limit and manage 
our concentrations in commercial real estate loans, improve our credit 
risk management and related policies and procedures, address liquidity 
management and current and future capital requirements, strengthen 
enterprise risk management practices, and provide for succession planning 
for key corporate and regional management positions and our board of 
directors. The memorandum of understanding also requires that we inform

any future dividends, and obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve

Synovus Bank is also presently subject to a memorandum of understanding 
with the GA DBF and the FDIC that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the Synovus memorandum of understanding described 
above. The bank memorandum of understanding also requires that 
Synovus Bank obtain approval from the GA DBF and the FDIC prior to 
paying any cash dividends to Synovus and provides that, as a result of our 
Charter Consolidation, we will take all necessary steps to avoid customer confusion as a result of our proposed use of trade names at our various 
bank branches and to update our long-term strategic plan to reﬂ ect the 
Charter Consolidation and the various actions we have otherwise agreed 
to implement under the memorandum of understanding. In addition, 
as a result of recent compliance exams, Synovus Bank entered into an 
informal written agreement with the FDIC relating to certain compliance 
matters. Under this agreement, Synovus Bank is required to implement 
written action plans, policies and procedures to address and remediate 
identiﬁ ed compliance concerns and furnish written quarterly progress 
reports to the FDIC.
If we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory 
agreements, or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with 
the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory 
agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, 
heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent 
orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, 
including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our Common Stock 
and Series A Preferred Stock. If our regulators were to take such additional 
supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to signiﬁ cant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as 
well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required 
to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory 
action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, 
operating ﬂ exibility, ﬁ nancial condition, and the value of our Common 
- Supervision, Regulation, and Other 
Factors” in this Report.Recent legislative and regulatory initiatives applicable 
to ﬁ nancial institutions in general and TARP recipients 
in particular could adversely impact our ability to 
attract and retain key employees and pursue business 
opportunities and could put us at a competitive 
disadvantage compared to our competitors and 
damage our reputation if these competitors repay their 
TARP funds before us.
Our success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated, 
well-qualiﬁ ed personnel. We face signiﬁ cant competition in the recruitment 
of qualiﬁ ed employees from ﬁ nancial institutions and others. Until we repay 
the TARP funds, we are subject to additional, and possibly changing, 
regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding the compensation of certain 
executives and associates as established under TARP guidelines. The 
increased scrutiny and restrictions related to our compensation practices may 
adversely impact our ability to recruit, retain and motivate key employees, 
which in turn may impact our ability to pursue business opportunities and 
could otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses and results of 
1-Business-“Actions by Federal and State Regulators” 
and “-Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors” in this Report.In addition to the guidelines on incentive and senior ofﬁ cer compensation 
under TARP, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the implementation of a 
variety of corporate governance and compensation practices applicable 
to all public companies, including Synovus, which may impact certain of Synovus’ executive ofﬁ cers and employees. These provisions include, 
but are not limited to, requiring companies to “claw back” incentive 
compensation under certain circumstances, provide shareholders the 
opportunity to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation, to 
consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires 
banking regulators to issue regulations or guidelines to prohibit incentive-
based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk 
taking by providing excessive compensation or that may lead to material 
loss at certain ﬁ billion or more in assets. Such 
provisions with respect to compensation, in addition to other competitive 
pressures, may have an adverse effect on the ability of Synovus to attract 
and retain skilled personnel.
Further,2010, the Federal Reserve, the Ofﬁ ce of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, the Ofﬁ ce of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC jointly 
issued comprehensive ﬁ nal guidance designed to ensure that incentive 
compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent 
risks. This regulation signiﬁ cantly restricts the amount, form, and context 
in which we pay incentive compensation.These restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared 
to our competitors that have repaid all TARP funds before us, or who did 
not receive TARP funds, and with non-ﬁ nancial institutions in terms of 
attracting and retaining senior level employees. Furthermore, to the extent 
that our competitors repay their TARP funds before us, our reputation and 
the public perception of our ﬁ nancial condition may be negatively affected, 
which could adversely affect our stock price.
Regulation of the ﬁ nancial services industry continues 
to undergo major changes, and future legislation 
could increase our cost of doing business or harm our

down, and global regulatory and legislative focus has generally moved to a

Frank Act, which has, and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. The Dodd-Frank Act represents 
a signiﬁ cant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the ﬁ nancial-services 
industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, 
deposit insurance assessments, consumer ﬁ nancial protection, interchange 
fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of 
investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. 
Among the provisions that may affect the operations of Synovus Bank or 
Synovus are the following:
 •Creation of the CFPB with centralized authority, including examination and 
enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.
 •New limitations on federal preemption.
 •New prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and 
nonbank ﬁ nancial company to engage in proprietary trading and have 
certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.
 •Application of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to 
leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components 
of permissible tiered capital.
 •Requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized 
and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for ﬁ nancial 
holding companies. •Changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.
 •Permanently raising the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance 
amount to $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and provide 
unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing demand transaction 
accounts through 2012.
 •Repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, 
ef2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay 
interest on business transaction and other accounts.
28.
 PAR 
 •Restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based 
compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by 
covered ﬁ nancial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that 
may lead to material losses. •Requirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities rpercentage 
of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities.
 •Requirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements 
of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them 
with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness.
Some of these and other major changes could materially impact the proﬁ tability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral 
available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force us to 
discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, 
enforcement actions and reputational risk. For example, the provisions of 
the Dodd-Frank Act relating to debit card interchange fees have reduced 
our fee income. We may not be able to fully replace the revenue lost by this 
limitation. If the existing unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing 
demand transaction accounts is not extended past the current expiration 
2012, we may see a run-off in certain noninterest-
bearing demand deposits to the extent such deposits exceed the FDIC’s 
$250,000 per depositor maximum insurance coverage limit, which may 
adversely impact our liquidity. Many of these provisions became effective 
upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others are subject to further 
study, rule making, and the discretion of regulatory bodies. In light of these 
signiﬁ cant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we 
cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or 
any implementing regulations will have on Synovus’ businesses or its ability 
to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from 
the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect Synovus’ business, 
ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations.
Certain other reform proposals under consideration, including new proposed 
regulatory capital requirements prIII, could 
result in Synovus becoming subject to stricter capital requirements and 
leverage limits, and could also affect the scope, coverage, or calculation 
of capital, all of which could require us to reduce business levels or to raise 
capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or 
cr- Supervision, Regulation and Other 
Factors.” We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if 
enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, 
ﬁ nancial condition, or results of operations.
The ﬁ nancial services market is undergoing rapid 
technological changes, and we may be unable to 
effectively compete or may experience heightened 
cyber security risks as a result of these changes.The ﬁ nancial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid 
changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products 
and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of 
technology increases efﬁ ciency and may enable us to reduce costs. Our 
future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to 
provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and 
to create additional efﬁ ciencies in our operations. Some of our competitors 
have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. 
We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products 
and services or be successful in marketing these products and services 
to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or 
acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, ﬁ nancial condition 
or results of operations, may be adversely affected.
Synovus is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks especially 
as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other 
remote channels to transact business. Two of the most signiﬁ cant cyber-
attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. 
Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds 
directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts to breach sensitive 
customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent but could present signiﬁ cant reputational, legal and/or 
regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters 
remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these 
threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide 
internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop 
additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers.
We are subject to a variety of operational risks, 

including reputational risk, legal risk and regulatory 

and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by 
employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our 
business and results of operations.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational 
risk, legal and regulatory and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft 
by employees or outsiders, including e-fraud and cyber-attacks and 
unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including 
clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled

Enterprise Risk Management” of this Report. Negative public opinion 
can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, 
including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and 
from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations 
in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect 
our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by Synovus can result in 
negative public opinion about our other business. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to our access to 
unsecured wholesale borrowings.
Our business involves storing and processing sensitive consumer and 
business customer data. If personal, non-public, conﬁ dential or proprietary 
information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or 
misused, we could suffer signiﬁ cant regulatory consequences, reputational 
damage and ﬁ nancial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for 
example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who 
are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, 
employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or 
otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. Furthermore, a cybersecurity 
breach could result in theft of such data.
Because the nature of the ﬁ nancial services business involves a high 
volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded 
before they are discovered and successfully rectiﬁ ed. Our necessary 
dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions 
and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that 
technical ﬂ aws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems 
will result in losses that are difﬁ cult to detect. We also may be subject to 
disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly 
or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical 
or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics 
or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to 
disruption of service to customers and to ﬁ nancial loss or liability. We are 
further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to 
fulﬁ ll their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of 
fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and 
to the risk that we (or our vendors’) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could 
result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business (for example, 
by requiring us to expend signiﬁ cant resources to correct the defect), as 
well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory 
intervention, which could adversely affect our business, ﬁ nancial condition 
or results of operations, perhaps materially.

management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we 
have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the 
possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, 
there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security 
breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately 
addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach 
of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of 
customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose 
us to civil litigation and possible ﬁ nancial liability.
The costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or other ﬁ nancial institutions 
or counterparties, or adverse facts and developments 
related thereto, could materially affect our business, 
operating results and ﬁ nancial condition.We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, 
inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those - 
8 of this Report. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may 
be asserted against it and indemniﬁ cation rights to which we are entitled 
may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of 
merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate 
judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation signiﬁ cantly 
exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations. In addition, 
premiums for insurance covering the ﬁ nancial and banking sectors are rising. 
We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in 
the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies 
with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all. We have exposure to 
many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute 
transactions with a variety of counterparties in the ﬁ nancial services 
industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or concerns about, one 
or more ﬁ nancial institutions with which we do business, or the ﬁ nancial 
services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in 
the past and could do so in the future and could lead to losses or defaults 
by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to 
credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, 
our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot 
be sold at prices that are sufﬁ cient for us to recover the full amount of 
our exposure. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our 

ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations.
We are named in several class action lawsuits and 
several related suits and inquiries, and if we are unable 
to resolve these matters favorably, then our business, 

operating results and ﬁ nancial condition would suffer.
We are named in several class action lawsuits and several related suits 
and inquiries including (1) a securities class action lawsuit alleging that misrepresentations or omissions in our securities ﬁ lings artiﬁ cially inﬂ ated

For those legal matters where Synovus is able to estimate a range of 
reasonably possible losses. Synovus’ management currently estimates the 
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is from zermillion. 
This estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available 
to Synovus, and the actual losses could prove to be higher (or lower). 
As there are further developments in these legal matters, Synovus will 
continually reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably 
possible losses may change as a result of this assessment. In addition, in 
the future, we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these 
matters. Further, regardless of how these matters proceed, it could divert 
our management’s attention and other resources away from our business.

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans 

or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of 
breaches of representations and warranties, borrower 
fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could 
harm our liquidity, results of operations and ﬁ
 nancial condition.Synovus Mortgage sells substantially all of the mortgage loans that 
it originates. While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase 
agreements require Synovus Mortgage to make certain representations 
and warranties regarding the existence and sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation 
and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as 
appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. If it is determined that 
loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties, Synovus 
Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the loan at the unpaid 
principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole 
for any economic losses associated with the loan. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to address perceived deﬁ ciencies 
in the residential mortgage loan origination and underwriting process, in 
part by creating new documentation requirements and underwriting criteria 
and increasing the potential liability of Synovus and Synovus Mortgage 
to their customers if Synovus and Synovus Mortgage fail to take steps 
to ensure and document that each borrower has the capacity and the 
ability to repay their loans.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2011 Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans. The 
total expense pertaining to losses from repurchases of mortgage loans 
previously sold, including amounts accrued in accordance with ASC 450, 
years ended 
2010, and 2009, respectively. The total accrued liability 
related mortgage repurmillion, at 
2011 and 2010, respectively. We cannot assure you that. 
in the current environment, Synovus Mortgage will not be required to 
repurchase substantially greater amounts of such mortgage loans, or make 
related indemnity payments to the purchasers of our mortgage loans. If the 
level of repurchases or indemnity demands becomes signiﬁ cant or Synovus 
Mortgage is alleged to be in non-compliance with the regulations under 
the Dodd-Frank Act, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its 
common stock. Management closely monitors trends and developments 
in credit quality, liquidity (including dividends from subsidiaries, which are 
expected to be signiﬁ cantly lower than those received in pryears), 
ﬁ nancial markets and other economic trends, as well as regulatory 
requirements regarding the payment of dividends, all of which impact 
Synovus’ capital position, and will continue to periodically review dividend 
levels to determine if they are appropriate in light of these factors and 
the restrictions on payment of dividends described below. In the current 
environment, regulatory restrictions may limit Synovus’ ability to continue to 
pay dividends. Synovus must inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends on its common 
and preferred stock, and the Federal Reserve Board could decide at any 
time that paying any dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In addition, Synovus must obtain the prior approval of the Banking 
Commissioner of the State of Georgia prior to increasing the quarterly cash

dividends on our common stock” of this Report.Under the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment 
or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles 
of Incorporation, or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital 
requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends, if any 
that we may pay.
Synovus’ ability to pay dividends is partially dependent upon dividends and 
distributions that it receives from its bank and non-banking subsidiaries, 
which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and 
state bank regulatory authorities. Dividends fr2010,

- 

Dividends.”Under the Federal Reserve Board guidance r2009 
the Federal Reserve may restrict our ability to pay dividends on any class of 
capital stock or any other T1 capital instrument if we are not deemed to 
have a strong capital position. In addition, we may have to reduce or eliminate 
dividends if: •our net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net 
of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufﬁ cient to fully 
fund the dividends; or •our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the 
holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition And Results of 
OperationsExecutive SummaryThe following ﬁ nancial review provides a discussion of Synovus’ ﬁ nancial condition, changes in ﬁ nancial condition, and resul
ts of operations as well as ead in conjunction with the audited consolidated ﬁ 
nancial statements and accompanying notes.Economic OverviewThe overall improvement of the U.S. economy appears to have gained 
momentum during the fourth quarter of 2011, building on moderate 
improvement in the third quarter of 2011. The initial stages of economic 

recovery emerged during the latter half of 2010, but softened during the 
ﬁ rst and second quarters of 2011 in response to a series of global events, 
including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, geo-political unrest in the 
Middle East, the mid-year elevation in energy costs, continued concerns 
over the debt of certain European nations, and the U.S. congressional battle 
over raising the U.S. debt ceiling. The economic progress achieved in the 
latter half of 2011 is anchored in an improved job market and indications 
that the housing market may be stabilizing. Additionally, consumer spending 
and consumer conﬁ dence strengthened during the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Certain European nations continue to wrestle with debt and budget deﬁ cit 
issues. There is a concern of the potential impact on the global economies 
beyond Europe if the European Central Bank and eurozone nations are 
unable to implement appropriate changes and solutions. The ultimate 
outcome; however, cannot presently be determined. Furthermore, there 
can be no guarantee that the domestic economy will continue to improve.
The improvement in economic measures during 2011 has been positive in 
the aggregate, but progress during the year has been uneven at times with 
mixed messages in many economic measures. Inﬂ ation remains subdued; 
however, energy prices continue to show volatility. The Federal Reserve’s 
commitment to hold inter
to be an indication that it is more concerned with sustaining recovery 
than the risk of inﬂ ation. Long-term interest rates have fallen signiﬁ cantly 
in response to the Federal Reserve Bank’s aggressive easing of monetary 
policy, with 10-year Treasury yields near 2% and ﬁ xed mortgage interest 
rates falling to record lows below 4%. Residential mortgage foreclosure 
and delinquency rates have declined over the past year, but remain at 
elevated levels compared to historical periods.
The Census Bureau reports new residential construction increased from 
2011 
as compar2010 rate of 630,000 units. In the South, 
rincreased by 17.0% frand 
increased 31.1% from a year ago. Mortgage rates continue to remain at 
record lows, due at least in part to Federal Reserve Bank efforts to lower 
long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. The supply of new 
homes decreased frmonths 
2011 and the median sales price increased 1.8% from 
$221,800 in 2010 to $225,800 in 2011. In the South, new homes 
sold decreased from approximately 173,000 in 2010 to approximately 
166,000 in 2011, and the median price increased from approximately 
$197,000 to approximately $210,000. Sales of existing single-family 
homes increased 1.7% frmillion in 2011. 
Distressed sales (foreclosures and short sales) accounted for approximately 
2011 as compared to approximately 36% in 
2010. The national median existing-home price for all housing 
types was appr2011, which is 2.5% 
2010 median. Existing housing inventory at the end 
2011 drmillion existing homes available for sale, 
representing a 6.2 month supply at the current sales pace, down from a 
2011. Existing housing inventory peaked 
2011 represents the lowest 
level since Mar2005 when there wermillion homes on the market.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis’ advance estimate rof 
2012 indicates that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.8% in 
the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to 1.8% in the third quarter of 
2011, 1.3% in the second quarter of 2011, 0.4% in the ﬁ rst quarter of 
2011, and 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The National Bureau of 
Economic Research (NBER) determined that the most recent recession 
2009. During 2010, the 
economy returned to an expansionary phase marked by a relatively slow 
recovery, but the rate of expansion softened substantially during the ﬁ rst 
and second quarters of 2011 and strengthened during the third and 
fourth quarters of 2011.The Southeastern U.S. economy has continued to improve, but at a very 
moderate pace during the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the 
U.S. economy as a whole. The labor force in Synovus’ ﬁ ve state footprint 
grew by approximately 85,000 jobs in 2011 as compared to an increase 
of approximately 91,000 during 2010. The unemployment rate in Synovus’ 
ﬁ ve state Southeaster2010, decreased 
to 10.3% in Mar2011, remained near 10.3% for most of the second 
and third quarters of 2011, and decr2011. 
2010, 
fell to 8.8% in Mar2011, but remained near 9.1% during the second 
and third quarters of 2011, and decr2011. 
The unemployment rates within Synovus’ footprint increased to elevated 
levels in ryears due to a combination of the collapse of the real estate 
market over ryears and the number of rural population centers which 
tend, on average, to experience generally higher rates of unemployment than the national average during all economic phases. Unemployment rates showed meaningful improvement during 2011, particularly during 
the fourth quarter of 2011.The Mortgage Bankers Association rpercentage of 
mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure to total mortgage loans 
was 4.43% during the third quarter of 2011, unchanged from the second 
quarter of 2011, reﬂ ecting a decrease from 4.52% in the ﬁ rst quarter of 
2011 and an increase of four basis points from 4.39% in the fourth quarter 
of 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, the thirty day delinquency rate 
reached its lowest level since the second quarter of 2007, a sign that new 
mortgage delinquencies have slowed. The delinquency rate for one-to-four-unit residential property mortgage loans decreased to 7.99% of all 
loans outstanding as of the end of the third quarter of 2011. This was a 
decrease of 45 basis points from the second quarter and a decrease of 
144 basis points from the third quarter of 2010.

As a result of the economic downturn, consumer saving and debt reduction 
have incryears while consumer spending 
has reﬂ ected restraint and uncertainty. There are many components to a 
sustainable economic recovery, including improved consumer spending, 
a stable housing market, expansion of employment, and a low level of inﬂ ation. Stable energy costs and governmental support through sound 
monetary and ﬁ scal policy are also key contributors. On the whole, economic 
conditions are currently positive, but the recovery to pre-downturn levels 
is expected to continue at a slower and more uneven pace than historical 
periods of recovery.
As the recession began to emerge in 2007, residential mortgage foreclosures 
began to escalate and real estate values began to decline. These factors 
expanded as the U.S. economy reached a conﬁ rmed recessionary 
trend and signiﬁ cantly impacted the performance of Synovus’ residential 
construction and real estate and land acquisition loan portfolios. Other 
segments of Synovus’ commercial loan portfolio were impacted as well, 

particularly in industries that were adversely impacted by the changes in 
commercial real estate and residential development. As a result, Synovus 
experienced signiﬁ cant increases in its credit costs, elevated levels of loan 
charge-offs, non-performing asset inﬂ ows, signiﬁ cant losses on distressed 
asset dispositions, and further valuation adjustments on existing non-performing assets. Synovus’ loan portfolio contracted during this period due to loan charge-offs, distressed asset sales, and weak demand for 
new loans. As the economy transitioned into recovery during the second 
half of 2010, certain segments of the economy began to stabilize, yet the supply of low cost housing due to cumulative foreclosures and distressed 
sales continued to exceed demand. While the housing market has lagged behind the general economic recovery to date as a whole, the decline 
in residential real estate prices has begun to stabilize in certain areas of 
the U.S. Though still at elevated levels as compared to historical periods, 
Synovus’ rate of non-performing asset inﬂ ows has declined, total credit 
costs have decreased, and loan charge-offs have declined as the economy 
moved into a period of recovery.
Bank failures ryears, particularly in 
Synovus’ Southeastern market. During 2011, the national trend improved 
signiﬁ cantly as bank failures decreased approximately 41% to 92. However, 
almost half of the 2011 failures occurred in Synovus’ ﬁ ve-state footprint, 
with 23 in Georgia, 13 in Florida, three in South Carolina and two in 
Alabama. The total number of failures in Synovus’ ﬁ ve state footprint 
declined from 55 in 2010 to 41 in 2011.
Mortgage Loan Repurchase Obligations and Foreclosure Practices
Since 2010, ﬁ nancial institutions have experienced a dramatic increase 
in the number of mortgage loan repurchase demands they received, 
including from government-sponsored entities, mortgage insurers, and 
other purchasers of residential mortgage-backed securitizations, due to 
ﬁ ndings of mortgage fraud and underwriting deﬁ ciencies in the mortgage 
origination process, and misrepresentations in the packaging of mortgages 
by certain mortgage lenders. Also since 2010, foreclosure practices of 
ﬁ nancial institutions nationwide have come under scrutiny due to the 
discovery of fraudulent documentation and questionable residential 
foreclosure procedures of certain ﬁ nancial institutions. To date, Synovus 
has experienced minimal repurchase activity in its consumer mortgage 
lending operations. Additionally, foreclosure activity in the home equity 
and consumer mortgage loan portfolios has been low. See “Mortgage 
Banking” in this Report for further discussion of Synovus’ experience with residential mortgage repurchase obligations and foreclosure activity in its 
home equity and consumer mortgage loan portfolios.Overview of 2011 Financial Results2011, Synovus reported a net loss 
attributable to common sharmillion, or $0.15 per

The improved results armillion decline in credit 
costs (provision for loan losses, losses on foreclosed real estate, and 
other credit costs) which was partially offset by income from discontinued 
million reported in 2010. The 2011 results include 
million in net investment securities gains while the 2010 results include 
million pre-tax gain from the sale of the merchant services business.
Although credit costs, charge-offs, and non-performing asset levels remain 
elevated, most credit quality measures have continued to show improvement 
during 2011. Total prmillion, a 
million or 63.0% improvement from 2010. Net charge-offs declined 
million, frmillion in 2011. Non-
performing assets declined 12.7% fr2010 
The decline in provision for loan losses from 2010 is primarily due to 
continued improvement in credit quality trends during 2011 including 
reduced net charge-offs, NPL inﬂ ows, and special mention and accruing 
substandard loans as well as continued migration in the mix of the loan 
portfolio to reduced levels of higher credit risk loan types.
While the provision for loan losses and loan charge-offs in 2011 declined 
from 2010 levels, these amounts continued to remain elevated when 
compared to historical levels. The elevated level of the provision for loan 
losses and loan charge-offs in 2011 was primarily driven by commercial 
credits, particularly in the commercial real estate segment. The provision 
for loan losses attributable to the commercial real estate portfolio was 
million, or 60.6% of the total expense for the year, while net charge-
offs attributable to this portfolio wermillion, or 61.2% of the total 
net charge-offs for the year. The provision for loan losses attributable to

other credit costs, securities gains and losses, and certain other items)

2010. See reconciliation of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Report. 
The decrease in pre-tax, pre-credit costs income was primarily due to 
lower net interest income resulting mainly from lower loan balances, as 
well as lower non-interest income. These items were partially offset by 
lower non-interest expense. The net interest margin increased 15 basis 
points to 3.51% for 2011 compared to 3.36% for 2010. The improvement 
in the net interest margin was due to a 31 basis point decrease in the 
effective cost of funds, partially offset by a 16 basis point decrease in the 
yield on earning assets.

Critical Accounting PoliciesThe accounting and ﬁ nancial reporting policies of Synovus conform to 
GAAP and to general practices within the banking and ﬁ nancial services 
industries. Synovus has identiﬁ ed certain of its accounting policies as 
“critical accounting policies.” In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, Synovus has identiﬁ ed the policies that require 
signiﬁ cant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management’s 
practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors’ 
Audit Committee, including the development, selection, and disclosure 
of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a signiﬁ cant impact on Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Synovus’ 
ﬁ nancial results could differ signiﬁ cantly if different judgments or estimates 
are applied in the application of these policies.
Allowance for Loan Losses1 and 7 to Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements contain a 
discussion of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses 
million, comparmillion 
The allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus, including the Credit Risk Committee for accuracy 
and consistency between the changes in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in the loan portfolio. The allowance 
for loan losses is determined based on an analysis which assesses 
the inherent risk for probable loss within the loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant 
judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the 
allowance for loan losses. Signiﬁ cant judgments include, among others, 
loan risk ratings and classiﬁ cations, the determination and measurement 
of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge-offs, the probability of loan 
defaults, the net loss exposure in event of loan defaults, qualitative loss 
factors, management’s plans, if any, for disposition of certain loans as well 
as other qualitative considerations. In determining an adequate allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, estimates, 
and assessments which are inherently subjective. The use of different 
estimates or assumptions could have a signiﬁ cant impact on provisions 
for loan losses, allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans, loan 
charge-offs, and other credit metrics. Please refer to 
- Summary 
of Signiﬁ cant Accounting Policies
 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
for an expanded discussion of the Company’s methodologies, qualitative 
considerations, and key assumptions.Other Real EstateOther real estate, consisting of properties obtained through a foreclosure 
proceeding or through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans, 
is reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell, determined 
on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates 
of fair value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for 
estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors or recent 
developments, such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering 
management’s plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments 
to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Signiﬁ cant 
judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value 
of other real estate, and the period of time within which such estimates 
can be considered current is signiﬁ cantly shortened during periods of 
market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic 
factors, management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its distressed 
asset disposition strategy. As a result of the signiﬁ cant judgments required 
in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of 
disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ 
signiﬁ cantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to 
determine the fair value of other real estate. Management reviews the value 
of other real estate each quarter and adjusts the values as appropriate.
Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance
ASC 740-30-25 provides accounting guidance for determining when a 
company is required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred tax 
assets. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, based 
on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion 
of the asset may not be realized due to the inability to generate sufﬁ cient 
taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary to utilize the 
beneﬁ t of the deferred tax asset. In making this assessment, all sources of 
taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset are considered, 
years, future reversals of 
existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and future taxable 
income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards. The 
predictability that future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary 
differences, will occur is the most subjective of these four sources. The 
presence of cumulative losses in ryears is considered signiﬁ cant 
negative evidence, making it difﬁ cult for a company to rely on future taxable 
income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, as 
a reliable source of taxable income to realize a deferred tax asset. Judgment 
is a critical element in making this assessment. Changes in the valuation allowance that result from favorable changes in those circumstances that 
cause a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets 
in future recorded through income tax expense.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Synovus considered all 
available evidence about the realization of DTAs, both positive and negative, 
that could be objectively veriﬁ ed. Synovus’ positive evidence considered 
in support of its use of forecasted future earnings as a source of realizing 
DTAs was insufﬁ cient to overcome the negative evidence associated 
with its pre-tax cumulative loss position. The total valuation allowance on 
deferr
Reversal of the DTA valuation allowance balance is subject to considerable 
judgment. However, Synovus expects to reverse substantially all (or 
apprmillion of the currmillion) 
of the DTA valuation allowance once it has demonstrated a sustainable 
return to proﬁ tability and experienced consecutive proﬁ table quarters 
coupled with a forecast of sufﬁ cient continuing proﬁ tability. This reversal 
could occur as a single event or over a period of time depending upon 
the level of forecasted taxable income, the degree of probability related 
to realizing the forecasted taxable income, and the estimated risk related 
to credit quality. In that event, there will remain limitations on the ability to 
include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. Pursuant to 
regulatory requirements, as taxes paid in carryback periods are exhausted, 
ﬁ nancial institutions must deduct from Tier I capital the greater of (1) the 
amount by which net deferred tax assets exceed what they would expect 
to realize within one year or (2) the amount by which the net deferred tax 
assets exceeds 10% of Tier I capital.
Fair Value Measurements
Synovus reviews assets and liabilities that are either required or elected 
to be carried, reported, or disclosed at fair value; and determines the 
valuation of these instruments in accordance with FASB ASC T820, 
Fair Value Measurements. 
We assess the fair value measurements of each 
instrument on a periodic basis, but no less than quarterly.
These fair value measurements consider the guidance in ASC 820, which 
provides a three-level framework for determining the appropriate fair value for 
a particular asset or liability. These levels require consideration of information, 
such as observable market prices, reported trades, broker quotes, various 
modeling techniques, including, in some cases, unobservable inputs.The Company selects the most appropriate technique for determining 
the fair value of the asset or liability. The various techniques described by 
ASC 820 require signiﬁ cant judgment, and results could vary materially, 
depending on the valuation method selected.39.

Fair value is measured, either on a recurring basis, in which the fair value 
is the primary measure of accounting; or on a non-recurring basis, to 
measure items for potential impairment, or for disclosure purposes.
Assets and liabilities measured under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 
are typically those that represent having the the least degree of liquidity.

for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of 
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying 
amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash ﬂ ows expected 
to be generated by the asset. If the actual cash ﬂ ows are not consistent 
with Synovus’ estimates, an impairment charge may result.
CapitalSeries A Preferred Stock
2008, Synovus issued to the Trshares 
A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation amount per 
sharA 
Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for the 
ﬁ rst ﬁ years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. Synovus may, at its 
option, with the consent of the FDIC, redeem, in whole or in part, the Series 
A Preferred Stock at the liquidation amount per share plus accrued and 
unpaid dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock is generally non-voting. 
However, if we fail to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for 
an aggregate of six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, our 
number of authorized directors will be increased by two and the holders 
of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to elect two directors. 
A consequence of the Series A Preferred Stock purchase includes certain 
restrictions on executive compensation that could limit the tax deductibility 
of compensation that Synovus pays to executive management.As part of its purA Preferred Stock, Synovus issued 
the Treasury a warrant to purshares of Synovus 

common stock (“Warrant”) at an initial per share exercise price of $9.36. 
The Warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the 
shares of Synovus common stock issuable upon exercise 
pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, such as upon stock splits 
or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of Synovus common 
stock, and upon certain issuances of Synovus common stock at or below 
a speciﬁ ed price relative to the initial exercise price. The Warrant expires 
2018. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, 
the Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to 
es of common stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
The ofeferred Stock and the Warrant were 
effected without registration under the Securities Act in reliance on the 
exemption from r4(2) of the Securities Act. Synovus 
has allocated the total proceeds received frStates Department 
of the Treasury based on the rA Preferred 
Stock and the Warrants. This allocation resulted in the preferrshares 
and the Warrants being initially recorded at amounts that are less than 
their respective fair values at the issuance date.
A Preferred Stock is being accreted 
using a constant effective yield over the ﬁ ve-year period preceding the 9% 
perpetual dividend. Synovus records increases in the carrying amount of 
the preferrshares resulting from accretion of the discount by charges 
against accumulated deﬁ cit.

Visa Shares and Related Agreement
Synovus is a member of the Visa USA network and rshares of Visa 
Class B common stock in exchange for its membership interest in Visa 
USA in conjunction with the public offering by the Visa IPO in 2008. Visa 
members have indemniﬁ cation obligations with respect to the Covered 
Litigation. Vshares are subject to certain restrictions until 
the latter of Mar2011 or settlement of the Covered Litigation. As of 
2011, the Covered Litigation had not been settled. Visa has 
established a litigation escrow to fund settlement of the Covered Litigation. 
The litigation escrow is funded by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of 
es.
Synovus carries a contingent liability representing the estimate of the 
Company’s exposure to the settlement of the Covered Litigation, via the 
Visa Derivative liability. A relatively high degree of subjectivity is used in 
estimating the value of the derivative liability. Management believes that 
the estimate of Visa’s exposure to litigation liability is adequate based on 
current information; however, future developments in the litigation could 
require potentially signiﬁ cant changes to the estimate.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is a signiﬁ cant 
component of revenue, representing earnings from the primary business of 
gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources, and investing 
those funds primarily in loans and investment securities. Synovus’ long-term 
objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest 
income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity, and capital risks.
Net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax-equivalent 
basis so that the income from assets exempt from federal income taxes is 
years 
(see Table 13). The net interest margin is deﬁ ned as taxable-equivalent 
net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets and 
provides an indication of the efﬁ ciency of the earnings from balance sheet 
activities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in the spread 
between interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs 
(sprpercentage of interest earning assets funded by 
non-interest bearing funding sources.
Net interemillion, 
or 6.3%, from 2010. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income 
decrmillion, or 6.3%, from 2010. During 2011, average 
earning assets decrbillion, or 10.3%, primarily the result of 
a decrease in net loans.
Net interemillion, 
or 2.4%, from 2009. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income 
decrmillion, or 2.4%, from 2009. During 2010, average 
earning assets decrbillion, or 7.4%, primarily the result of 
declines in net loans, offset in part by an increase in balances held with 
the Federal Reserve Bank.Net Interest Margin
The net interest margin was 3.51% for 2011, an increase of 15 basis 
points from 2010. The yield on earning assets decreased 16 basis points 
to 4.33% and the effective cost of funds decreased 31 basis points to 
0.82%. The effective cost of funds includes non-interest bearing funding 

sources primarily consisting of demand deposits.
The primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan 
yields, the yield on investment securities, and the yield on balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank. During 2011, loan yields decreased 8 
basis points to 5.09%. The decrease in loan yields was due to a continued 
decline in market interest rates and the downward repricing of maturing 
ﬁ xed rate loans, partially offset by an improvement in the negative impact 
of non-performing loans. Yields on investment securities decreased by 
101 basis points due to continued declines in bond market yields and the reinvestment of cash ﬂ ows from older, higher yielding securities. 
The yield on investment securities was also negatively impacted by a 
repositioning of the portfolio undertaken during the third quarter of 2011. 
A key component of this repositioning was the sale of higher coupon, 
more prepayment sensitive MBS, and the purchase of lower coupon 
MBS with less prepayment risk. This action was deemed to be prudent 
in light of continued declines in rates and the expectation of a higher level 
of prepayment activity. While increasing the stability of cash ﬂ ows and 
expected yields on the portfolio, the short term impact of selling higher coupon MBS is negative to the overall portfolio yield. The yield on balances 
held at the Federal Reserve Bank remained unchanged at 0.25% while 
the average balance decrbillion in 2011. 
Reducing these low yielding balances positively impacts realized earning 
asset yields. Synovus expects to further reduce the average balances 
held at the Federal Reserve Bank during 2012.The primary factors contributing to the 31 basis point decrease in the 
effective cost of funds during 2011 were a 36 basis point decrease in the 
cost of time deposits and a 30 basis point decrease in the cost of money

market accounts. In addition to these factors, reduced utilization of brokered 
deposits and a continued deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction 
accounts favorably impacted the effective cost of funds. Average non-
interest bearing demand deposits, which incrmillion, or

effective cost of funds decreased by 43 basis points.
During 2010, loan yields increased 15 basis points to 5.17% with 
improvement due to a modest decline in the cost to carry non-performing 
assets and an improvement in loan origination pricing. Average net loans 
decrbillion in 2010. Yields on 
investment securities decreased by 83 basis points primarily due to the 
continued historically low level of bond market yields and the reinvestment 
of cash ﬂ ows from older higher yielding securities. The yield on balances 
held at the Federal Reserve Bank remained the same at 0.25% in 2010 
as in 2009 while the average balance held at the Federal Reserve Bank 
incrbillion in 2010. A signiﬁ cant portion of 
the increase in short-term liquidity resulted from cash proceeds from the 
of 2010. This higher level of low yielding balances 
held at the Federal Reserve resulted in a reduction in realized earning 
asset yields.The primary factors contributing to the 43 basis point decrease in the effective 
cost of funds were a 95 basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits 
and a 16 basis point decrease in the cost of money market accounts. 
Additional factors that contributed to the decrease in the effective cost 
of funds in 2010 include growth in non-interest bearing demand deposit 
accounts, reduced utilization of brokered time deposits, and a continued 
deposit mix shift toward lower cost transaction accounts.

Impact from Regulatory Reform on Fee 
IncomeDuring 2010 and 2011, regulations that reduce NSF fees and debit card 
interchange fee income became ef2010, Regulation 
E became effective. This regulation limits the ability of a ﬁ nancial institution 
to assess an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine and debit 
card transactions that overdraw a customer’s account unless the customer 
afﬁ rmatively consents, or opts-in, to the institution’s payment of overdrafts 
for these transactions. The impact to NSF fees from this regulation for 2011 
and 2010 were decreases of apprmillion, 
respectively2011, Synovus implemented certain 
processing changes as required by regulatory guidance that resulted in 
a decrease in NSF fees of apprmillion for the year ended 
2011, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became 
effective. These provisions, commonly referred to as the “Durbin 
Amendment,” amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and required 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to develop rules 
that implement, among other things, interchange fee restrictions on debit 
card transactions. The reduction in debit card interchange fee revenue 
resulting from these provisions was apprmillion in 2011, which 
represents a full year projected reduction of appr
2012. The 2012 projected reduction is net of expense savings relating to 
the debit card program which will be implemented in 2012.
While a full replacement of the reduction in revenue from the regulatory 
reform impacts described above is not expected in 2012, Synovus 
has developed new fee income strategies to aid in partially offsetting 
the impact of regulatory reform. Future additional rulemaking or further 
regulatory changes could impact our ability to execute new strategies to 
re- Regulation of

The goodwill is associated with two ﬁ nancial management services 
reporting 
unit that is a provider of investment advisory services. We test goodwill 
for impairment annually30, using a two-step process that 
begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit. Goodwill 
impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis as events occur or circumstances change between annual 
tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting 
unit below its carrying amount. Signiﬁ cant judgment is applied when 
goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing cash ﬂ ow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying 
relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and market 
conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium. The selection 
and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher 
or lower fair value. Judgment is also applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. The assumptions used in the 
goodwill impairment assessment and the application of these estimates and assumptions are discussed below.
The ﬁ rst step (Step 1) of impairment testing requires a comparison of 
each reporting unit’s fair value to the carrying fair value to identify potential 
2011, we completed the annual goodwill impairment 
evaluation. The result of the Step 1 process indicated that goodwill at the

therefore no further testing was required. The estimated fair value of this

million, which exceeded the carrying value 
million, or 18%. The key assumptions that drive 
the fair value of this reporting unit are projected revenue growth, projected 
EBITDA margin, projected growth in assets under management, and the 
discount rate. The projected revenue growth incorporates the new business 
that this reporting unit is expecting to add through its recent partnerships 
with national platforms, as well as a long-term average of movement in AUM related to equity and ﬁ xed income market returns. Additionally, the 
projected EBITDA margin increases are based on the assumption that the 
current business platform is very scalable and future increases in AUM/
revenue will require minimal incremental expenditures.
Changes in the aforementioned assumptions, including a lower rate 
of revenue growth than expected and a lower than projected EBITDA 
margin improvement, could have a negative effect on the fair value of 
this reporting unit, which in turn could result in an impairment charge to 
goodwill in future periods.

Mortgage BankingSynovus’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Mortgage, originates residential 
billion 
in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Synovus Mortgage offers various types 
of ﬁ xed-rate and adjustable-rate loans for the purposes of purchasing, 
reﬁ nancing, or constructing residential properties. The originated loans 
are primarily conforming mortgage loans for owner-occupied properties. 
Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the 
underwriting standards set forth by government sponsored entities such 
as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation. These are generally collateralized 1-4 family residential 
real estate properties and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without 
recourse, or continuing involvement. Each purchaser of Synovus’ mortgage 
loans has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans, and the risk 
of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is 
generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the loans are sold 
without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus Mortgage to 
make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and 
sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or 
other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan. 
If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these representations 
or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the 
loan at the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the 
purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of the loan.
Repurchase Obligations for Mortgage Loans 
Originated for SaleResidential mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are sold to 
third-party purchasers on a non-recourse and servicing released basis. 
These loans are originated and underwritten internally by Synovus personnel 
and are primarily to borrowers in Synovus’ geographic market footprint. 
These sales are typically effected as as non-recourse loan sales to GSEs 
and non-GSE purchasers.
Each GSE and non-GSE purchaser has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria for 
sellers of loans, and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount 
of the loans sold is transferred to the purchasers upon sale. While the 
loans are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements require Synovus 
Mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the 
existence and sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the absence of fraud 
by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with 
obtaining the loan. If it is determined that loans sold were in breach of these 
representations or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has obligations to either 
repurchase the loan at the unpaid principal balance and all interest and fees 
due or make the purchaser whole for the economic beneﬁ ts of the loan.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2011, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans. The

Of this amount, apprmillion, respectively, 
consists of mortgages relating to properties in Florida and South Carolina 
which are states in which foreclosures proceed through the courts. To 
date, foreclosure activity in the home equity and consumer mortgage loan 
portfolio has been low. Any foreclosures on these loans are handled by 
designated Synovus personnel and external legal counsel, as appropriate, 
following established policies regarding legal and regulatory requirements. 
Based on information currently available, management believes that it does 
not have signiﬁ cant exposure to faulty foreclosure practices.

elated loans’ unpaid principal balance.
It is Synovus’ objective to dispose of ORE properties in a timely manner 
and to maximize net sale proceeds. Synovus has a centralized managed 
assets division, with the specialized skill set to facilitate this objective. 
While there is not a deﬁ ned timeline for their sale, these ORE properties 
are actively marketed through unafﬁ liated third parties, including real estate 
brokers and real estate auctioneers. Sales are made on an opportunistic 
basis, as acceptable buyers and terms are identiﬁ ed. In addition, Synovus 
also sells ORE properties in bulk asset sales to unafﬁ liated third parties. In 
some cases, Synovus is approached by potential buyers of ORE properties 
or Synovus may contact independent third parties who we believe might 
have an interest in an ORE property.
Investment Securities Available for Sale
The investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt securities classiﬁ ed as available for sale. Investment securities available for sale 
provide Synovus with a source of liquidity and a relatively stable source 
of income. The investment securities portfolio also provides management 
with a tool to balance the interest rate risk of its loan and deposit portfolios. 
See Table 16 for maturity and average yield information of the investment 
securities available for sale portfolio.The investment strategy focuses on the use of the investment securities portfolio to manage the interest rate risk created by the inherent mismatch 
between the loan and deposit portfolios. Synovus held the portfolio duration 
at a relatively constant level for most of 2011 while the average balance of 
the portfolio increased from the prior year. The average duration of Synovus’ 
2011 
compar2010. During the third quarter 
of 2011, Synovus implemented a repositioning of the investment securities 
portfolio. The primary purpose of this repositioning was to reduce prepayment 
risk in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. This was accomplished by selling higher coupon, more prepayment sensitive mortgage-backed 
securities, and purchasing lower coupon mortgage-backed securities with 
less prepayment risk. In addition to these actions, Synovus sold selected 
short duration U.S. Treasury and corporate securities and reinvested the 
proceeds in moderate duration mortgage-backed securities.
Synovus also utilizes a signiﬁ cant portion of its investment portfolio to 
secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization. At 
2011, apprbillion of these investment 
securities were pledged as required collateral for certain deposits, securities 
sold under repurchase agreements, payment network arrangements, and 
FHLB advances. The investment securities are primarily debt securities 
government sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed 
securities issued by GSEs, both of which have a high degree of liquidity 
and limited credit risk. A mortgage-backed security depends on the 
underlying pool of mortgage loans to provide a cash ﬂ ow pass-through 
of principal and inter2011, all of the collateralized

Commercial real estate loans are primarily originated through Synovus’ 
local market banking divisions. In accordance with Synovus’ uniform 
lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process which 
incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight in proportion 
to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. The commercial real 
2011 and 2010 includes loans in the 
billion, respectively, of which 
million, respectively, represent the combined 1-4 
family construction, residential development and land acquisition portfolios.

and land development portfolios.Investment Property Loans
Investment property loans consist of construction and mortgage loans for 
income producing properties and are primarily made to ﬁ nance multi-family 
properties, hotels, ofﬁ ce buildings, shopping centers, warehouses and other 
commercial development properties. Synovus’ investment property portfolio 
is well diversiﬁ ed with no concentration by property type, geography (other 
than the fact that most of these loans are in Synovus’ primary market areas 
of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Florida), or tenants. 
These loans are generally recourse in nature with short-term maturities 
(thryears or less) allowing for restructuring opportunities that reduce 
Synovus’ overall risk exposure. The investment property loans are primarily 
secured by the property being ﬁ nanced by the loans; however, they may also 
be secured by real estate or other assets beyond the property being ﬁ nanced. 
Investment property loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies 
referenced above, although such loans have historically been underwritten 
with stressed interest rates and vacancies. In addition, Synovus has placed 
restrictions on both hotel and shopping center lending. Synovus reviews 
quarterly all investment prmillion or more to more closely 
monitor the performance of the portfolio. Total investment property loans as 
2011 werbillion, or 62.7% of the total commercial 
real estate loan portfolio, and 22.7% of the total loan portfolio, compared

1-4 Family Properties Loans
1-4 family properties loans include construction loans to homebuilders, 
commercial mortgage loans to real estate investors, and residential 
development loans to developers and are almost always secured by the 
underlying property being ﬁ nanced by such loans. These properties are primarily 
located in the markets served by Synovus. These loans are subject to the 
same uniform lending policies referenced above. Additionally, underwriting 
standards for these types of loans include stricter approval requirements 
as well as more stringent underwriting standards than current regulatory 
guidelines. Construction and residential development loans are interest-only 
loans and typically carry maturities of thryears or less, and 1-4 family 
rental properties carry maturities of three to ﬁ years, with amortization

Land Acquisition LoansLand acquisition loans are secured by land held for future development, 
typically in excess of one year. They have short-term maturities and are 
typically unamortized. These properties are substantially within the Synovus 
footprint and generally carry personal guarantees from the principals. 
They are underwritten based on the loan to value of the collateral and 
the capacity of the guarantor(s). This portfolio increased during the 
recession as land loans originally planned for development moved back 
into inventory for future development. These loans are generally subject 
to the same uniform lending policies referenced above, and the maximum 
loan-to-value limit at the time of origination or reﬁ nancing is aligned with 
regulatory requirements. Total land acquisition loans werbillion

Commercial and Industrial Loans
The commercial and industrial loan portfolio represents the largest category 
of Synovus’ total loan portfolio. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio 
is currently concentrated on small to middle market commercial and 
industrial lending disbursed throughout a diverse group of industries in the 
Southeast, including health care, ﬁ nance and insurance, manufacturing, 
construction, real estate leasing and retail trade. The portfolio is relationship 
focused and, as a result, Synovus’ lenders have in-depth knowledge of 
the borrowers, most of which have guaranty arrangements. Commercial 
and industrial loans are primarily originated through Synovus’ local market 
banking divisions and made to commercial customers primarily to ﬁ nance 
capital expenditures, including real property, plant and equipment, or as 
a source of working capital. These loans are subject to the same uniform 
lending policies referenced above. Approximately 93% of Synovus’ 
commercial and industrial loans are secured by real estate, business 
equipment, inventory, and other types of collateral. Total commercial and

the total loan portfolio, comparbillion, or 42.9% of the total

or 3.5% from 2010.
billion, or 43.1% of the total commercial 
and industrial loans represent loans for the purpose of ﬁ nancing owner-
occupied properties. The primary source of repayment on these loans is 
revenue generated from products or services offered by the business or 
organization. The secondary source of repayment on these loans is the 
real estate. These loans are predominately secured by owner-occupied 
and other real estate. Other types of collateral securing these loans 
consist primarily of marketable equipment, marketable inventory, accounts 
receivable, equity and debt securities, and time deposits.
C&I lending is a key component of Synovus’ growth plans and diversiﬁ cation 
strategy (reducing overall concentration in CRE and grpercentage 
of C&I loans relative to the total loan portfolio). Synovus has actively invested 
in additional expertise, product offerings, and product quality to provide its 
commercial and industrial clients with increased and enhanced product 
offerings and customer service. Complementing this investment in C&I 
growth, Synovus’ management continues to focus on streamlining and 
enhancing Synovus’ existing product lines, especially for traditional retail, 
small business and professional services customers.
While lending to small and mid-sized businesses has been Synovus’ 
traditional focus, in 2010, Synovus formed a Large Corporate Banking Team to provide lending solutions to larger corporate clients in an effort 
to strengthen, diversify and further drive growth in Synovus’ C&I loan 
portfolio. In conjunction with the formation of the Large Corporate 
Banking Team, Synovus implemented a strategy to increase the level of 
participation in loan syndications which has contributed to the funding of apprmillion in loan syndications and an additional 
apprmillion in commitments during 2011. During mid-
2011, Synovus hired an experienced senior housing lending team. That 
team funded apprmillion of senior housing loans during 
the last half of 2011.2011 and 2010, Synovus had 26 and 27 commercial 
loan relationships, respectivelymillion 
or more (including amounts funded). The average funded balance of

Retail LoansThe retail loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products 
offered through Synovus’ banking network, including ﬁ rst and second 
residential mortgages, HELOC, credit card loans, automobile loans, small 
business loans, and other retail loans. These various types of secured 
and unsecured retail loans are marketed to qualifying existing clients and 
to other creditworthy candidates in Synovus’ market area. The majority 
of Synovus’ retail loans are consumer mortgages and home equity lines 
secured by ﬁ rst and second liens on residential real estate primarily 
located in the markets served by Synovus in Georgia, Florida, South 
Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. In accordance with Synovus’ uniform 
lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process 
which incorporates uniform underwriting standards and oversight that is 
proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. Retail 

loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies referenced above 
and consist primarily of loans with strong borrower credit scores (most 
recently measur2011 weighted-average FICO scores 
within the residential real estate portfolio were 751 for HELOC and 736 
for Consumer Mortgages), conservative debt-to-income ratios (average 2011), utilization rates (total 
percentage of total available lines) of approximately 
2011, and loan-to-value ratios based upon prudent 
guidelines to ensure consistency with Synovus’ overall risk philosophy. 
Apart from credit card loans and unsecured loans, Synovus does not 
originate loans with LTV ratios greater than 100% at origination except 
for infrequent situations provided that certain underwriting requirements 
are met. Additionally, at origination, loan maturities are determined based 
on the borrower’s ability to repay (cash ﬂ ow or earning power of the 
borrower that represents the primary source of repayment) and the 
collateralization of the loan, including the economic life of the asset being pledged. Collateral securing these loans provides a secondary source of 
repayment in that the collateral may be liquidated. Synovus determines the 
need for collateral on a case-by-case basis. Factors considered include 
the purpose of the loan, current and prospective credit-worthiness of the 
customer, terms of the loan, and economic conditions. Total retail loans

Risk levels 1-6 (descending) are assigned based upon risk scores and are 
considered “pass” ratings. The retail loan portfolio is sent to a consumer 

credit reporting agency for a refresh of customers’ credit scores at least 
annually to determine ongoing consistency or negative migration in the 
quality of the portfolio. As part of the refresh most recently updated as of 
2011, revolving lines of credit were reviewed for a material 
change in ﬁ nancial circumstances and suspended for further advances

million of 
retail residential real estate loans (4.9% of said portfolio and 0.7% of the 
total loan portfolio) with FICO scores at origination that were below Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac eligibility thresholds which could be considered 
sub-prime. While FICO scores are one key indicator of credit risk, Synovus 
makes retail residential real estate lending decisions based upon a number 
of key credit risk determinants including FICO scores as well as bankruptcy 
predictor scores, loan-to-value, and debt-to-income ratios. Through its 
mortgage subsidiary, Synovus previously originated Fannie Mae alt-A loans 
with the intent to sell these loans into the secondary market. Synovus no 
million 
of such loans remaining on its balance sheet.
2009, Synovus’ loan policy did not speciﬁ cally prohibit the 
origination of no documentation or stated income loans as long as such loans were supported by other risk mitigating criteria including, but not 
limited to, established banking relationship history, signiﬁ cant cash on 
deposit, and/or compensating loan-to-value or debt-to-income ratios. 2009, as Synovus has continued to tighten its retail residential 
real estate origination policy, no documentation or stated income loans are 
permitted to be made only on an exception basis and only if supplemented 
by the mitigating criteria previously noted. While Synovus does not currently 
offer speciﬁ c no documentation or stated income retail residential real estate 
loan products, loans with these characteristics could have been issued 
under the previous loan policy or as an exception under the current loan 
policy, primarily to individuals with existing banking relationships. Synovus 
does not believe it has originated a signiﬁ cant dollar amount of such loans 
and does not believe that extending such loans has had a signiﬁ cant 
negative impact on the credit quality of the portfolio.
2011, weighted average FICO scores within the retail 
residential real estate portfolio were 751 (HELOC) and 736 (Consumer 
Mortgages). FICO scores within the retail residential real estate portfolio 
have remained stable since 2007. Total past dues within the retail residential 
r2011 were 0.8% (HELOC) and 
2.0% (Consumer Mortgages) compared to 0.9% (HELOC) and 1.6% 
2010. The net charge-off ratios

Monitoring of CollateralSynovus follows a risk-based approach as it relates to the credit monitoring 
processes for its loan portfolio. Synovus updates the fair value of the real estate 
collateral securing collateral-dependent impaired loans each calendar quarter, 
with appraisals usually received on an annual basis, or sooner if appropriate, 
from an independent unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser. Management 
also considers other factors or recent developments, such as selling costs 
and anticipated sales values considering management’s plans for disposition, 
which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated 
in the appraisals. Synovus updates the values of collateral that is in the form 
of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and cash surrender value of 
life insurance policies at least annually and the values of collateral that is in 
the form of marketable securities and brokerage accounts at least monthly.
It is the Company’s policy to obtain, on at least an annual basis, an updated 
appraisal from an independent, unafﬁ liated certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser for 
loan rmillion and over when at least one of the loans in 
the relationship is on non-accrual status. For remillion, 
while independent appraisals are not mandated by the Company’s policies, 
management will obtain such appraisals when considered prudent. For credits 
that are not on impaired status, Synovus generally obtains an unafﬁ liated 
third-party appraisal of the value of the real estate collateral prior to each 
loan renewal. Additionally, if conditions warrant (e.g., loans that are not 
considered impaired but exhibit a higher or potentially higher risk), Synovus 
engages an unafﬁ liated appraiser to reappraise the value of the collateral 
on a more frequent basis. Examples of circumstances that could warrant a 
new appraisal on an existing performing credit include instances where local 
market conditions where the real estate collateral is located have deteriorated, 
the collateral has experienced damage (ﬁ re, wind damage, etc.), the lease 
or sell-out of the collateral has not met the original projections, and the net 
operating income of the collateral has declined. In circumstances where 
the collateral is no longer considered sufﬁ cient, Synovus seeks to obtain 
additional collateral. Examples of adjustments made quarterly to appraised 
values include broker’s commission, unpaid real estate taxes, attorney’s 
fees, other estimated costs to dispose of the property, known damage to 
the property, known declines in the net operating income of the property or 
rent rolls, as well as third-party market data.

proactive measure in managing the loan portfolio. Subsequent to the 
implementation of the asset disposition strategy, Synovus entered into 
the Synovus MOU. The Synovus MOU was in alignment with the existing asset disposition strategy, including managing various asset quality and 
regulatory capital ratios. The asset disposition strategy is still in place

Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings necessary 
to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. Through the provision 
for loan losses, Synovus maintains an allowance for losses on loans that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent 
in the loan portfolio. However, future additions to the allowance may be 
necessary based on changes in economic conditions, as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower’s ability to pay and/or collateral 
values. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their 
examination procedures, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. 
Based on their judgments about information available to them at the time 
of their examination, such agencies may require Synovus to recognize

Loan GuaranteesIn addition to collateral, Synovus generally requires a guarantee from all 
principals on all commercial real estate and commercial and industrial 
lending relationships. Speciﬁ cally, Synovus generally obtains unlimited 
guarantees from any entity (e.g., individual, corporation, or partnership) 
that owns or controls 50 percent or more of the borrowing entity. Limited 
guarantees on a pro rata basis are generally required for all 20 percent 
or more owners.
Synovus evaluates the ﬁ nancial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation 
of the guarantor’s current ﬁ nancial statements, income tax returns for 
the two most recent years, as well as ﬁ nancial information regarding a 
guarantor’s business or related interests. In addition, Synovus analyzes 
substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor 
has the necessary ownership or control over these assets. For loans that 
are not considered impaired, the allowance for loan losses is determined 
based on the risk rating of each loan. The risk rating incorporates a 
number of factors, including guarantors. If a loan is rated doubtful, with 
certain limited exceptions, a guarantee is not considered in determining 
the amount to be charged-off (i.e., the charge-off equals the greater of 
the amount of the collateral exposure or 50% of the loan balance, in 
compliance with regulatory requirements). With the exception of certain 
loans whose amount is inconsequential, all impaired loans are collateral 
dependent. The charge-off on these loans is determined based upon the 
amount of the collateral exposure only.
With certain limited exceptions, Synovus seeks performance under 
guarantees in the event of a borrower’s default. However, under the current 
economic environment, and based on the fact that a majority of Synovus’ 
problem credits are commercial real estate credits, Synovus’ success in 
recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited.
Allocation of the Allowance for Loan LossesT26 shows a ﬁ ve year comparison of the allocation of the allowance 
for loan losses. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on certain loss factors which could differ from the speciﬁ c amounts or 
loan categories in which charge-offs may ultimately occur.
The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans coverage was 60.76% 
2011 compar2010. 
This ratio is impacted by collateral-dependent impaired loans which have 
no allowance for loan losses as the estimated losses on these credits 
have been charged-off. Therefore, a more meaningful allowance for loan 
losses coverage ratio is the allowance to non-performing loans excluding collateral-dependent impaired loans for which there is no related allowance 
2011 compared 
2010. This ratio declined as a result of an 
increase in non-performing loans that carried a reserve, combined with 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses.

The unallocated allowance is 0.24% and 0.39% of total loans at 
2011 and 2010, respectively. The unallocated component 
of the allowance for loan losses is considered necessary to provide for 
certain qualitative environmental and economic factors that affect the 
probable loss inherent in the Company’s total loan portfolio.
The qualitative factors included in the determination of the unallocated 
component of the allowance for loan losses include the following: •economic conditions; •changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management 
and loan review staff;
 •changes in the loan origination and monitoring policies and procedures;
 •changes in the volume and trend of impaired loans and past-due loans;
 •changes in concentrations and volume and nature of loan growth;
 •risk of grading not keeping pace with the speed and depth of deterioration 
in economic conditions, particularly related to identifying special-mention 
credits;
 •estimated risk associated with the deterioration in the fair value of 
collateral supporting Synovus’ loans; •and other external impacts (as may be applicable).
Qualitative factors could have a signiﬁ cant impact on the inherent risk 
of loss in the Company’s loan portfolio. The unallocated allowance for 
million or 8.9% of the total 
allowance for loan losses. This represents a rmillion 
fr2010 
million or 12.0% of the allowance for loan losses at that date. 
This decline is primarily due to reduced volatility in loan grading, as the 
pace and depth of the deterioration in economic conditions is no longer causing continuous and rapid declines in loan grades. For example, 
accruing substandard loans, which increased frbillion at 
2010, declined to 
2011. Additionally, special mention loans, 
declined frbillion at 
2011, a 16.5% decline. Further positively impacting the 
2011 were general 
improvements in loan monitoring management and policies.
A substantial number of Synovus’ loans are secured by real estate located 
in ﬁ ve Southeastern states (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, 
and Tennessee). Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial part 
of Synovus’ loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas. Based on current information and market conditions, 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate.A summary by loan category of loans charged off, recoveries of loans

Non-performing Assets and Past Due LoansNon-performing assets consist of loans classiﬁ ed as nonaccrual loans 
as well as real estate acquired through foreclosure. Accrual of interest on 
loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection 
of interest or principal, or when they become contractually in default for 
days or more as to either interest or principal, unless they are both 
well-secured and in the process of collection. Nonaccrual loans consist of 
those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued. 
Nonaccrual loans are reduced by the direct application of interest and 
principal payments to loan principal, for accounting purposes only.
Restructuring of Past Due Loansdays or more, which based on a determination of 
collectability are accruing interest, are classiﬁ ed as past due loans. 
Synovus’ historic and current policy prohibits making additional loans to 
a borrower, or any related interest of a borrower, who is on nonaccrual 
status except under certain workout plans and if such extension of credit 
aids with loss mitigation. Additionally, Synovus’ historic and current policy 
discourages making additional loans to a borrower or any related interest 
of the borrower who has a loan that is past due in principal or interest

Management continuously monitors non-performing and past due loans to 
mitigate further deterioration regarding the condition of these loans. Potential 
problem loans are deﬁ ned by management as certain performing loans with 
a well-deﬁ ned weakness where there is information about possible credit 
problems of borrowers which causes management to have doubts as to 
the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms 
of such loans. Potential problem commercial loans consist of substandard 
days past due and still accruing 
interest and substandard accruing troubled debt restructurings, which are 
reported separately. Management’s decision to include performing loans 
in the category of potential problem loans indicates that management

become non-performing loans or result in losses. The trend of potential 
problem commercial loans has been declining and is down 58.3%, or

Troubled Debt Restructurings
When borrowers are experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, the Company may, 
in order to assist the borrowers in repaying the principal and interest owed 
to the Company, make certain modiﬁ cations to the loan agreement. All loan 
modiﬁ cations are evaluated for troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classiﬁ cation. 
In accordance with ASU 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination of Whether 
a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, a TDR is deﬁ ned as a 
modiﬁ cation with a borrower that is experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, and 
the Company has granted a ﬁ nancial concession that it would not normally 
make.  
All TDR’s are considered to be impaired loans, and the amount of 
impairment, if any, is determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, 
Accounting By Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-an amendment of FASB 
Concessions provided by the Company in a TDR are primarily in the form 
of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower’s credit risk, 
a period of time generally less than one year with a reduction of required 
principal and/or interest payments (e.g., interest only for a period of time), 
or extension of the maturity of the loan generally for less than one year.

Insigniﬁ cant periods of reduction of principal and/or interest payments, or 
one time deferrals of 3 months or less, are generally not considered to be 
ﬁ nancial concessions. Further, it is generally the Company’s practice not 
to defer principal and/or interest for mor
These types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the maturity of a loan, in which the borrower is experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culty, as a loan renewal.
Renewals of loans made to borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties 
are evaluated for TDR designation by determining if concession(s) are 
being granted, including consideration of whether the renewed loan has 

an interest rate that is at market, given the credit risk related to the loan.
Non-accruing TDRs may generally be returned to accrual status if there has 
been a period of performance, usually at least a six month sustained period 
of repayment performance by the borrower. Consistent with regulatory 
guidance, a TDR will generally no longer be reported as a TDR after a 
period of performance and after the loan was reported as a TDR at a year-
end reporting date, and if at the time of the modiﬁ cation the interest rate 

was at market, considering the credit risk associated with the borrower.
2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination 
of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, which 
was effective for the ﬁ rst interim or annual period beginning on or after 
2011, Synovus adopted the provisions of 
ASU 2011-02, and as required, applied the provisions of the ASU to all 
modiﬁ cations and renewals that have occurr2011. 
Synovus often increases or maintains the interest rate upon renewal 
of a commercial loan, including renewals of loans involving borrowers 
experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2011-02, 
the interest rate on such renewals were generally not considered by 
Synovus to be concessionary and were not considered TDRs. The market 
interest rate concept in ASU 2011-02 states that if a borrower does not 
otherwise have access to funds at a market interest rates for debt with 
characteristics similar to those of the restructured debt, the restructuring 
would be considered to be at a below-market rate, which indicates that the 
lender may have granted a concession. This component of ASU 2011-02 
resulted in an increase of apprmillion in loans identiﬁ ed as

Following the Charter Consolidation, management developed a strategic plan to diversify Synovus’ funding sources and reduce reliance on volatile funding 
sources including brokered deposits and Shared Deposit products. The strategic 
initiatives implemented by management have reduced Synovus’ dependence 
on brokered deposits and Shared Deposit products primarily through:
 •allowing partial runoff of maturing brokered deposits,
 •reducing utilization of brokered money market accounts,
 •reduction of Shared Deposit balances as the program expires, and
 •maintaining and enhancing local market core deposit base.

LiquidityLiquidity represents the extent to which Synovus has readily available 
sources of funding needed to meet the needs of depositors, borrowers 
and creditors; to support asset growth; fund deposit withdrawals; maintain 
reserve requirements; and to otherwise sustain operations of Synovus, its 
Synovus Bank and other subsidiaries, at a reasonable cost, on a timely 
basis, and without adverse consequences. ALCO monitors Synovus’ 
economic, competitive, and regulatory environment and is responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, and reporting on liquidity and funding risk, interest 
rate risk, and market risk and has the authority to create policies relative to 
these risks. ALCO, operating under liquidity and funding policies approved 
by the Board of Directors, actively analyzes contractual and anticipated 
cash ﬂ ows in order to properly manage Synovus’ liquidity position.
Contractual and anticipated cash ﬂ ows are analyzed under normal and 
stressed conditions to determine forward looking liquidity needs and 
sources. Synovus analyzes liquidity needs under various scenarios of 
market conditions and corporate operating performance. This analysis includes stress testing and measures expected sources and uses of 
funds under each scenario. Emphasis is placed on maintaining numerous 
sources of current and potential liquidity in order for the company to meet 
its obligations to depositors, borrowers, and creditors on a timely basis.
Liquidity is generated through maturities and repayments of loans by 
customers, maturities and sales of investment securities, deposit growth, 
and access to sources of funds other than deposits. Management constantly 
monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide 
adequate funding sources to meet estimated customer deposit withdrawals 
and future loan requests. Liquidity is also enhanced by the acquisition of 
new deposits. Each of the banking divisions monitors deposit ﬂ ows and 
evaluates alternate pricing structures in an effort to retain and grow deposits. 
Customer conﬁ dence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits. 
In this regard, Synovus’ asset quality could play a larger role in the stability 
of the deposit base. In the event asset quality declines signiﬁ cantly from its 
current level, the ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished, 
which in turn could reduce deposits as a liquidity source.
2011, Sharmillion. 
Synovus continues to pursue retention of Shared CD balances at maturity; 
however, there can be no assurance that a signiﬁ cant portion of these 
deposits will remain on deposit at Synovus Bank. While the possibility of 
this deposit outﬂ ow is a potential liquidity risk, this risk has diminished as 
remaining Shared deposit balances have declined. Retention of signiﬁ cant 
liquid assets, primarily in the form of interest bearing funds with the Federal 
Reserve, should enable Synvous Bank to mitigate liquidity risks related to 
any outﬂ ow of these deposits at their maturity.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, ef2010, 
unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing demand 
transaction accounts was extended thr2012. This 
component of the Dodd-Frank Act served to extend unlimited insurance coverage which was initially established by the TAGP. Under current law, 
insurance coverage for non-interest bearing demand deposits will decline 
2012. Currently, 
Synovus has a signiﬁ cant customer base which maintain non-interest bearing 
demand deposit balances that would exceed the insurance threshold after 
2012 if this unlimited insurance coverage is not extended. Synovus’ ability to retain these deposits would depend on numerous factors, including 
general economic conditions and the operating performance and credit 
quality of Synovus. As this represents a potential liquidity risk, Synovus 
expects to maintain an above average level of liquidity sources to mitigate 
such risk and to continue to monitor this risk throughout 2012. See “Part 
- Regulation of the ﬁ nancial services industry 
continues to undergo major changes, and future legislation could increase 
our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position.”Synovus Bank also generates liquidity through the national deposit markets. 
Synovus Bank issues longer-term certiﬁ cates of deposit across a broad 
geographic base to increase its liquidity and funding position. Access to 
these deposits could become more limited if Synovus Bank’s asset quality 
and ﬁ nancial performance were to signiﬁ cantly deteriorate. Synovus Bank

As a ﬁ nancial holding company, Synovus and its subsidiary bank, Synovus 
Bank, are required to maintain capital levels required for a well-capitalized 
institution as deﬁ ned by federal banking regulations. The capital measures 
used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk-based capital 
ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio. Synovus Bank 
is a state-chartered bank under the regulations of the GA DBF. Under 
applicable regulations, Synovus Bank is well-capitalized if it has a total 
risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or 
greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any written 
agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive 
from a federal and/or state banking regulatory agency to meet and maintain 
a speciﬁ c capital level for any capital measure. However, even if Synovus 
Bank satisﬁ es all applicable quantitative criteria to be considered well-
capitalized, the regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an 
institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other 2010, Synovus Bank entered into a memorandum 
of understanding with the FDIC and the GA DBF agreeing to maintain a 
minimum leverage ratio of 8% and a minimum total risk-based capital 
to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%. Management believes that, as 
2011, Synovus and Synovus Bank meet all capital 
requirements to which they are subject.
Synovus has experienced signiﬁ cant credit losses in recent years, primarily 
as a result of an extended period of economic downturn impacting all 
States economy. While the level of credit losses 
has declined signiﬁ cantly from the peak with most credit quality measures 
continuing to improve, current levels of credit losses and non-performing 
assets are still elevated compared to historical levels. The cumulative 
effect of these credit losses over recent years has negatively impacted 
Synovus’ capital position. As a result, Synovus has completed a number 
of steps to strengthen its capital position as described below. Synovus 
continuously and actively manages capital including forecasting and stress 
testing for both expected and more adverse economic conditions and 
will pursue additional strategies designed to bolster its capital position 
when and as deemed necessary. If credit losses and credit deterioration 
exceed management’s current expectations, they could adversely impact 
Synovus’ capital ratios.2009, and 2010, Synovus completed several public offerings 
and other capital actions which are described below.

During 2009, Synovus undertook several initiatives to bolster its capital including a public ofes of common stock that 
generated net proceeds of apprmillion, the exchange of

shares of Synovus’ common stock, which resulted 
in an increase to tangible common equity of apprmillion, 
and the sale of Synovus’ rshares of Visa Class B common stock, 
which resulted in a pre-tax gain of apprmillion. See Notes 
13 and 20 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in this Report for further 
information regarding the 2009 common stock offering, note exchange, 
and sale of Visa Class B common stock.
During 2010, Synovus undertook additional initiatives to further boost 
its capital including the sale of its merchant services business which 
resulted in a pre-tax gain of apprmillion, a public offering 
shares of common stock, and 13,800,000 units of 
tMEDS. The common stock and tMEDS offerings, which were completed

charge-offs, foreclosures, and losses on disposition of distressed assets. 
While these levels continue to remain high, most credit quality measures are

continuing to improve; however, it remains difﬁ cult to predict whether the 
recent improvements experienced will continue, or whether the effects of 
any further potential future negative developments in the credit, economic, 
and regulatory environments will adversely impact these improving trends.
Management currently believes, based on current internal capital analyses 
and earnings projections, that Synovus’ capital position is adequate to 
meet current regulatory minimum capital requirements. However, Synovus 
continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry capital 
standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, and 
engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at 
both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with any future repayment of Synovus’ 
obligations under the CPP.

Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations amounted to million for the year2011, compared to an 
income tax beneﬁ  t of 
million in 2009. The 2011 effective income tax rate was (2.2)% 
compared to 1.8% and 10.7% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The income 
tax expense attributable to discontinued operations is reﬂ ected as a 
component of “income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” 
in the consolidated ﬁ 25 to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for a detailed analysis of income taxes.
Synovus reported a net deferred tax asset, before the valuation allowance, 

million was generated from temporary differences of 
which the majority relates to the provision for loan losses. This component 
does not have a set expiration date as the temporary differences have 
not yet reduced taxable income. The remaining net deferred tax asset 
balance, beformillion relates to tax net 
operating loss deductions and state income tax credits that must be 
carried forward. The majority of these tax carryforwards have set expiration 
dates, typically 15 or 20 years, from the date they are originally generated. 
Synovus currently expects that apprmillion of its net deferred 
tax assets will expire before they can be realized. The majority of these 
deferred tax assets relate to state income tax credits that have various 
expiration dates through the tax year 2016.
Synovus expects to record minimal to no tax expense when reporting pre-tax 
proﬁ ts in the future because reductions to the DTA valuation allowance will 
be recognized offsetting current tax expense. Reversal of the DTA valuation 
allowance balance is subject to considerable judgment. However, Synovus 
expects to reverse substantially all (or apprmillion of the 
currmillion) of the DTA valuation allowance once it has 
demonstrated a sustainable return to proﬁ tability, perhaps at the point it has 
signiﬁ cantly improved credit quality and experienced consecutive proﬁ table 
quarters coupled with a forecast of sufﬁ cient continuing proﬁ tability. This 
reversal could occur as a single event or over a period of time depending 
upon the level of forecasted taxable income, the degree of probability 
related to realizing the forecasted taxable income, and the estimated risk 
related to credit quality. In that event, there will remain limitations on the 
ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. 
Pursuant to regulatory requirements, as taxes paid in carryback periods 
are exhausted, ﬁ nancial institutions must deduct from Tier I capital the 
greater of (1) the amount by which net deferred tax assets exceed what 
they would expect to realize within one year or (2) the amount by which 
the net deferred tax assets exceeds 10% of Tier I capital.
The U.S. Administration is seeking to lower the current 35% corporate 
income tax rate. If the corporate income tax rate is lowered, it could 
adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset balance.
2010, the Synovus Board of Directors approved a shareholder rights 
plan designed to preserve Synovus’ substantial tax assets. This plan was 
ratiﬁ ed by Synovus’ shar2011. This plan is similar to tax 
beneﬁ t preservation plans adopted by other public companies with signiﬁ cant 
tax attributes whose ability to realize such beneﬁ t may become restricted 
by an ownership change under IRC Section 382. Synovus’ tax attributes include net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, reversing temporary 
differences as reﬂ ected in deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 
and certain built-in losses that it could utilize in certain circumstances to 
offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability.
An “ownership change”, as deﬁ ned under Section 382 of the IRC and 
related Internal Revenue Service pronouncements, substantially limits 
a company’s ability to use its tax attributes. In general, an ownership 
change would occur if Synovus’ “5-percent shareholders,” as deﬁ ned 
under Section 382, collectively increase their ownership in Synovus by 
more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The 
shareholder rights plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that Synovus 
experiences such an ownership change by deterring acquisitions that 
would increase the holdings of existing 5-percent shareholders or cause 
any person or group to become a 5-percent shareholder. 5-percent 
shareholders generally do not include certain institutional holders, such 
as mutual fund companies, that hold Synovus equity securities on behalf of several individual mutual funds where no single fund owns 5 percent 
or more of Synovus equity securities.

Inﬂ ationA ﬁ nancial institution’s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature; 
therefore, inﬂ ation can have an important impact on the growth of total 
assets in the banking industry and may create a need to increase equity 
capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital 
ratios. Interest rate levels are also signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced by changes in 
the rate of inﬂ ation although they do not necessarily change at the same 
time or magnitude as the inﬂ ation rate. These changes could adversely 
impact Synovus’ ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ tability. Synovus attempts to 
mitigate the effects of inﬂ ation and changing interest rates by managing 
its interest rate sensitivity position through its asset/liability management 
practices and by periodically adjusting its pricing of services and banking products in an effort to take into consideration such costs. See “Market 
Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity” herein.
Deﬂ ationAn extended period of deﬂ ation could negatively impact the banking industry 
and may be associated with lower growth and a general deterioration of 
the economy. Such a scenario could impair bank earnings and proﬁ tability 
in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, decreases in the value of 
collateral for loans, a diminished ability of borrowers to service their debts, 
increases in the value of certain bank liabilities, and lessened demand for 
loans. While these effects cannot be fully accounted for, Synovus attempts 
to mitigate such risks through prudent underwriting of loans and through 
the management of its interest rate sensitivity position.
Parent Company
The Parent Company’s assets, primarily its investment in subsidiaries, are 
funded, for the most part, by shareholders’ equity. It also utilizes short-term 
and long-term debt. The Parent Company is responsible for providing the 
necessary funds to strengthen the capital of its subsidiaries, acquire new 
businesses, fund internal growth, pay corporate operating expenses, and 
pay dividends to its shareholders. These operations have historically been 
funded by dividends and fees received from subsidiaries, and borrowings 
from outside sources. However, as a result of the challenging economic 
conditions, dividends from subsidiaries were signiﬁ 2010, 
and 2009 than in previous years. Additionally, the Parent Company was 
required to provide higher levels of capital infusions to subsidiaries during 
2010 and 2009. Thus, Synovus has taken a number of steps to strengthen 
its capital and liquidity positions as described below.
2008, the Parent Company received proceeds of 
million from the sale of preferred stock and warrants to the

om the sale of certain private equity investments.
2009, Synovus completed an exchange offer (“Exchange 
Offer”) of $29,820,000 in aggregate principle amount of its outstanding 
4.875% Subordinated Notes Due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”). The Notes 
exchanged in the Exchange Offer represent 12.6% of the $236,570,000 
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding prior to the Exchange 
Offer. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, Synovus issued 
shares of Synovus’ common stock as consideration for the

in evaluating Synovus’ operating results, ﬁ nancial strength and capital 
position. These non-GAAP ﬁ nancial measures should not be considered 
as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with 
GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at 
other companies. Pre-tax, pre-credit costs income is a measure used by 
management to evaluate core operating results exclusive of credit costs 
as well as certain non-core income and expenses such as investment 
securities gains and restructuring charges. Core expenses are measures 
used by management to gauge the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs. Core 
deposits and core deposits excluding time deposits are measures used 
by management to evaluate organic growth of deposits and the quality of 
deposits as a funding source. The tangible book value per common share 
is a measure used by management and investment analysts to evaluate 
the market value of Synovus’ common stock. The tangible common equity 
to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio are used by management and investment analysts to assess 
the strength of Synovus’ capital position. The computations of these 
measures are set forth in the table below.

es About Market Risk
ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures 
About Market RiskMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Market risk reﬂ ects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes 
in market prices and interest rates. This risk of loss can be reﬂ ected in 
either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential 
net income. Synovus’ most signiﬁ cant market risk is interest rate risk. This 
risk arises primarily from Synovus’ core community banking activities of 
extending loans and accepting deposits.Managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management 
function. Synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income 
while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates. Synovus 
seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing 
characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of 
derivative instruments. Synovus manages its exposure to ﬂ uctuations 
in interest rates through policies established by ALCO and approved by 
the Board of Directors. ALCO meets periodically and has responsibility 
for developing asset liability management policies, reviewing the interest 
rate sensitivity of Synovus, and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning.
Simulation modeling is the primary tool used by Synovus to measure its 
interest rate sensitivity. On at least a quarterly basis, the following twenty-
four month time period is simulated to determine a baseline net interest 
income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest 
rates. The baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or ﬂ at interest rate 
environment. These simulations include all of Synovus’ earning assets, 
liabilities, and derivative instruments. Forecasted balance sheet changes, 
primarily reﬂ ecting loan and deposit growth expectations, are included 
in the periods modeled. Projected rates for new loans and deposits are 
based on management’s outlook and local market conditions.
The magnitude and velocity of rate changes among the various asset and liability groups exhibit different characteristics for each possible interest 
rate scenario; additionally, customer loan and deposit preferences can 
vary in response to changing interest rates. Simulation modeling enables 
Synovus to capture the expected effect of these differences. Synovus is 
also able to model expected changes in the shape of interest rate yield 
curves for each rate scenario. Simulation also enables Synovus to capture 
the effect of expected prepayment level changes on selected assets and 
liabilities subject to prepayment.
Synovus’ rate sensitivity position is indicated by selected results of net 
interest income simulations. In these simulations, Synovus has modeled 
the impact of a gradual increase in short-term interest rates of 100 and 
basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the 
next year. Due to short-term interest rates being at or near 0% at this time, 
only rising rate scenarios have been modeled. As illustrated in T38, 
the net interest income sensitivity model indicates that, compared with a 
net interest income forecast assuming stable rates, net interest income 
is projected to increase by 2.0% and increase by 2.7% if interest rates 
incrbasis points, respectively. These changes were 
within Synovus’ policy limit of a maximum 5% negative change.The measured interest rate sensitivity indicates a moderately asset sensitive 
position over the next year, which could serve to improve net interest 
income in a rising interest rate environment. The actual realized change in 
net interest income would depend on several factors, some of which could 
serve to diminish or eliminate the asset sensitivity noted above. Market conditions and their resulting impact on loan, deposit, and wholesale funding 
pricing and volumes would be a primary risk to the projected interest rate 
sensitivity and a primary determinant in the realized level of net interest 
income. These risks include, but are not limited to, higher than projected 
pressure on deposit pricing due to market competition or a greater than 
projected rate of customer migration to higher cost deposits, such as 
certiﬁ cates of deposit.
Synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Financial management services revenues, which include trust, 
brokerage, and ﬁ nancial planning fees, can be affected by risk in the 
securities markets, primarily the equity securities market. A signiﬁ cant 
portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of 
asset values. Weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an 
adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations. Trading account 
assets, maintained to facilitate brokerage customer activity, are also subject 
to market risk. This risk is not considered signiﬁ cant, as trading activities 
are limited and subject to risk policy limits. Mortgage banking income is 
also subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to 
levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income 
could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates. The 
extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also 
subjects Synovus to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time 
period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan. Synovus seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk 
management tools, the primary of which are forward sales commitments 
and best efforts commitments.

Derivative Instruments for Interest Rate Risk Management
As part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus 
utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types 
of interest rate risks. These instruments are in the form of interest rate 
swaps where Synovus receives a ﬁ xed rate of interest and pays a ﬂ oating 
rate tied to either the prime rate or LIBOR. These swaps are utilized to 
hedge the variability of cash ﬂ ows or fair values of on-balance sheet 
assets and liabilities.Interest rate derivative contracts utilized by Synovus include end-user 
hedges, all of which are designated as hedging speciﬁ c assets or liabilities. 
These hedges are executed and managed in coordination with the overall 
interest rate risk management function. Management believes that the 
utilization of these instruments can provide greater ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility and 
efﬁ ciency in managing interest rate risk.
2011, Synovus had no outstanding interest rate 
swap contracts utilized to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount 
of interest rate swap contracts utilized as part of overall interest rate risk 
million. The notional 
amount represents the amount on which calculations of interest payments 
to be exchanged are based.
Entering into interest rate derivatives contracts potentially exposes Synovus 
to the risk of counterparties’ failure to fulﬁ ll their legal obligations including, 
but not limited to, potential amounts due or payable under each derivative 
contract. This credit risk is normally a small percentage of the notional 
amount and ﬂ uctuates based on changes in interest rates. Synovus analyzes 
and approves credit risk for all potential derivative counterparties prior to 
execution of any derivative transaction. Synovus assesses the ongoing credit risk of its dealer counterparties by regularly monitoring publicly 
available credit rating information and other market indicators. Synovus 
seeks to limit credit risk by dealing with highly-rated counterparties and by 
obtaining collateralization for exposures above certain predetermined limits.
A summary of these interest rate contracts and their terms at 
2010 is included in Note 18 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements. The fair value (net unrealized gains and losses) of these 
contracts has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Synovus Financial Corp.:We have audited Synovus Financial Corp.’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
r2011, based on criteria established in 
Internal 
— Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Synovus Financial Corp.’s 
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over 
ﬁ nancial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over ﬁ nancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial 
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight BoarStates). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁ nancial 
reporting and the preparation of ﬁ nancial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reﬂ ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Synovus Financial Corp. maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over ﬁ nancial r2011, 
based on criteria established in— Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight BoarStates), the consolidated

2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes 
in equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash ﬂ ows for each of 
the years in the thr2011, and our

 Summary of Signiﬁ
 cant Accounting PoliciesBusiness OperationsThe consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Synovus include the accounts of 
the Parent Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Synovus provides 
integrated ﬁ nancial services, including commercial and retail banking, 
ﬁ nancial management, insurance, and mortgage services to its customers 
through 30 locally-branded divisions of its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, 
Synovus Bank, and other ofﬁ ces in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, 
Florida, and Tennessee.
Basis of Presentation
The accounting and reporting policies of Synovus conform to GAAP and 
to general practices within the banking and ﬁ nancial services industries. All 
signiﬁ cant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of 
the respective consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual results could 
differ signiﬁ cantly from those estimates.
Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to signiﬁ cant change 
relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses; the valuation 
of other real estate; the valuation of impaired and other loans held for sale; 
the fair value of investment securities; the valuation of long-lived assets and other intangible assets; the valuation of deferred tax assets; the 
valuation of the Visa indemniﬁ cation liability; and other contingent liabilities. 
In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and 
the valuation of certain impaired loans and other real estate, management 
obtains independent appraisals for signiﬁ cant properties and properties 
collateralizing impaired loans. In making this determination, management 
also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes 
in absorption rates or market conditions at the time of valuation and 
anticipated sales values based on management’s plans for disposition.
A substantial portion of Synovus’ loans are secured by real estate in ﬁ ve 
Southeastern states (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and 
Tennessee). Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion 
of Synovus’ loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in these areas. Total commercial real estate loans represent 36.2% of the 
2011. Due to declines in economic 
indicators and real estate values over the past three years, the loans in the 
commercial real estate portfolio may have a greater risk of non-collection 
than other loans. Based on available information, management believes 
that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the 
allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, 
the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and management’s plans for 
disposition. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part 
of their examination process, periodically review Synovus’ allowance for 
loan losses. Such agencies may require Synovus to make changes to the 
allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.The following is a description of the more signiﬁ cant of Synovus’ accounting 
and reporting policies.
Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks. At 
2011 and 2010, cash and cash equivalents includes 
espectively, on deposit to meet Federal 
Reserve Bank requirmillion of 
the due from banks balance is restricted as to withdrawal, including 
million on deposit pursuant to a payment network arrangement. 
There were no cash and cash equivalents restricted as to withdrawal at 
Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments consist of interest bearing funds with the Federal 
Reserve Bank, interest earning deposits with banks, and federal funds sold 
and securities purchased under resale agreements. Interest earning deposits 
million 
2010, which is pledged as collateral in connection 
with certain letters of cr
2010, which 
is pledged to collateralize certain derivative instruments in a net liability position. Federal funds sold, federal funds purchased, securities purchased 
under resale agreements, and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
generally mature in one day.
Trading Account Assets
Trading account assets, which are primarily held on a short-term basis for 
the purpose of selling at a proﬁ t, consist of debt and equity securities and 
are reported at fair value. Fair value adjustments and fees from trading 
account activities are included as a component of other fee income on 
the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses realized from 
the sale of trading account assets are determined by speciﬁ c identiﬁ cation 
and are included as a component of other fee income on the trade date. 
Interest income on trading assets is reported as a component of interest 
income on the consolidated statement of operations.Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Mortgage 
Banking IncomeMortgage Loans Held for SaleMortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Fair value is derived 
from a hypothetical-securitization valuation model used to project the exit 
price of the loan in securitization using the bid pricing convention. The valuation model is based upon forward settlement of a pool of loans with 
similar loan maturity, product types and credit attributes in a speciﬁ ed 
narrow coupon band. The model inputs are updated daily with available 
current market and historical data. As the loans are sold in the secondary 
market and predominately used as collateral for securitizations, the 
hypothetical-securitization valuation model represents the principal market 
and the best estimate of fair value.Mortgage Banking IncomeMortgage banking income consists primarily of origination, ancillary fees, 
and gains and losses from the sale of mortgage loans. Mortgage loans 
are sold servicing released, without recourse or continuing involvement 
and satisfy ASC 860-10-65, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, 
criteria for sale accounting. Gains (losses) on the sale of mortgage loans are determined at each assessment of the fair value of the individual 
loans within the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale, representing 
the difference between net sales proceeds and the fair value of the loans 
at the time of sale.77.
PAR 
Other Loans Held for SaleLoans are transferred to other loans held for sale at fair value less costs to 
sell when Synovus makes the determination to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed 
loans. The fair value of the loans is primarily determined by analyzing the 
underlying collateral of the loans and the anticipated market prices of 
similar assets less estimated costs to sell. At the time of transfer, if the 
fair value is less than the carrying amount, the difference is recorded as a 
charge-off against the allowance for loan losses. Decreases in the fair value 
subsequent to the transfer, as well as losses (gains) realized from sale of 
these loans, are recognized as a component of non-interest expense on 

the consolidated statements of operations.Investment Securities Available for Sale
Available for sale securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and 
losses on securities available for sale, net of the related tax effect, are 
excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of 
equity, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until realized.
Synovus conducts a quarterly review and evaluation of its investment 
securities to determine if the decline in fair value of a security below 
its amortized cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Other-than-
temporary impairment losses are recognized on securities when: (i) the 
holder has an intention to sell the security; (ii) it is more likely than not 
that the security will be required to be sold prior to recovery; or (iii) the 
holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the 
security. Other-than-temporary impairment losses are reﬂ ected in earnings 
as a charge against investment securities gains (losses), net to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment 
related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
(loss). Synovus has no intention to sell any securities in an unrealized loss 
2011 prior to the recovery of the unrealized 
loss, nor is it more likely than not that Synovus would be required to 
sell such securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized losses. As of 
2011, Synovus believes that all impairments of investment 
securities are temporary in nature.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the 
related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
and prepayment assumptions. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed 
periodically and the timing of the accretion and amortization is adjusted 
accordingly. Interest income on securities available for sale is recorded 
on the accrual basis. Dividend and interest income are recognized when 
earned. Realized gains and losses for securities are included in investment 
securities gains (losses), net on the consolidated statements of operations and are derived using the speciﬁ c identiﬁ cation method, on a trade date 
basis, for determining the amortized cost of securities sold.Loans and Interest Income on Loans
Loans are reported at principal amounts outstanding less amounts charged 
off, net deferred fees and expenses. Interest income and deferred fees, 
net of expenses on loans are recognized on a level yield basis.
Non-accrual LoansLoans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated 
as non-accrual loans. Accrual of interest is discontinued on loans when 
reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection of interest or principal, or 
days or more as to either 
interest or principal, in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, 
unless they are both well-secured and in the process of collection. When a 
loan is placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected 
interest is generally reversed as an adjustment to interest income on loans. 
Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are generally applied as 
a reduction of principal. As payments are received on loans with partial 
principal charge-offs, interest income can be recognized on a cash basis; 
however, there must be an expectation of full repayment of the remaining 
recorded principal balance. The remaining portion of this payment is recorded 
as a reduction to principal. Loans are generally returned to accruing status 
when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal 
and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to 
be fully collectible as to both principal and interest, and the borrower has 
sustained repayment performance under the terms of the loan agreement 
for a reasonable period of time (generally six months).
Impaired Loans
Impaired loans are loans for which it is probable that Synovus will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the 
loan agreements and all loans modiﬁ ed in a troubled debt restructuring 
(TDR). Other than TDRs, impaired loans do not include large groups of 
smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for 
impairment, which consist of most retail loans and commercial loans less 
million. Impairment is measured on a discounted cash ﬂ ow 
method based upon the loan’s contractual effective interest rate, or at the 
loan’s observable market price, or at the fair value of the collateral if the 
loan is collateral dependent. Impairment is measured based on the fair 
value of the collateral less costs to sell if it is determined that foreclosure is 
probable or that the loan will be paid off solely by the sale or liquidation of 
the collateral. Interest income on non-accrual impaired loans is recognized 
as described above under “non-accrual loans.” Impaired accruing loans 
generally consist of those troubled debt restructurings for which management 
has concluded that the collectibility of the loan is not in doubt.Commercial loans to borrowers with aggregate outstanding borrowings 
million or more are considered for impairment classiﬁ cation and, if 
impaired, the loan is individually assessed for impairment. Impairment 
is measured using either a discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology or, if the 
loan is considered collateral-dependent, the estimated fair value of the 
2011, substantially 
all non-accrual impaired loans were collateral-dependent. Most of these 
loans were secured by real estate. For impairment measured using the 
estimated fair value of collateral less costs to sell, fair value is estimated using appraisals performed by a certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser. Management 
also considers other factors or recent developments, such as selling 
costs and anticipated sales values, taking into account management’s 
plans for disposition, which could result in adjustments to the fair value 
estimates indicated in the appraisals. The assumptions used in determining 
the amount of the impairment are subject to signiﬁ cant judgment. Use 
of different assumptions, for example, changes in the fair value of the 
collateral or management’s plans for disposition, could have a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the amount of impairment.Under the discounted cash ﬂ ow method, impairment is recorded as a 
speciﬁ c reserve with a charge-off for any portion of the speciﬁ c reserve 
considered a conﬁ rmed loss. The reserve is reassessed each quarter and 
adjusted as appropriate based on changes in estimated cash ﬂ ows. The 
discounted cash ﬂ ow method requires the projection of the timing and 
amount of the best estimate of future cash ﬂ ows from the borrower’s net 
rents received from the property, guarantor contributions, sales of collateral 
or other properties, reﬁ nances, etc. Once the amount and timing of the 
cash ﬂ ow stream has been estimated, the net present value using the loan’s 
effective interest rate is calculated to determine the amount of impairment.
Where guarantors are determined to be a source of repayment, an 
assessment of the guarantee is required. This guarantee assessment 
would include, but not be limited to, factors such as type and feature of 
the guarantee, consideration for the guarantor’s ﬁ nancial strength and 
capacity to service the loan in combination with the guarantor’s other 
ﬁ nancial obligations as well as the guarantor’s willingness to assist in 
servicing the loan.Troubled Debt Restructurings
When borrowers are experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties, the Company may, 
in order to assist the borrowers in repaying the principal and interest owed 
to the Company, make certain modiﬁ cations to the loan agreement. All 
78.
PAR 
loan modiﬁ cations are evaluated for troubled debt restructuring (TDR) 
classiﬁ cation. In accordance with ASU 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination 
of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring, a TDR is 
deﬁ ned as a modiﬁ cation with a borrower that is experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culties, and the Company has granted a ﬁ nancial concession that it 
would not normally make.All TDR’s are considered to be impaired loans, and the amount of impairment, 
if any, is determined in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, Accounting By 
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-an amendment of FASB Statements 
Concessions provided by the Company in a TDR are primarily in the form 
of providing a below market interest rate given the borrower’s credit risk, 
a period of time generally less than one year with a reduction of required 
principal and/or interest payments (e.g., interest only for a period of time), 
or extension of the maturity of the loan generally for less than one year.
Insigniﬁ cant periods of reduction of principal and/or interest payments, or 
one time deferrals of 3 months or less, are generally not considered to be 
ﬁ nancial concessions. Further, it is generally the Company’s practice not 

to defer principal and/or interest for more than 12 months.
These types of concessions may be made during the term of a loan or upon the maturity of a loan, in which the borrower is experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culty, as a loan renewal.
Renewals of loans made to borrowers experiencing ﬁ nancial difﬁ culties 
are evaluated for TDR designation by determining if concession(s) are 
being granted, including consideration of whether the renewed loan has 

an interest rate that is at market, given the credit risk related to the loan.
Non-accruing TDRs may generally be returned to accrual status if there has 
been a period of performance, usually at least a six month sustained period 
of repayment performance by the borrower. Consistent with regulatory 
guidance, a TDR will generally no longer be reported as a TDR after a 
period of performance and after the loan was reported as a TDR at a year-
end reporting date, and if at the time of the modiﬁ cation the interest rate 

was at market, considering the credit risk associated with the borrower.
Allowance for Loan LossesThe allowance for loan losses is a signiﬁ cant estimate and is regularly 
evaluated by Synovus for accuracy and consistency between the changes 
in the allowance for loan losses with the credit trends and credit events in 
the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on 
an analysis which assesses the inherent risk for probable loss within the 
loan portfolio. Signiﬁ cant judgments and estimates are necessary in the 
determination of the allowance for loan losses. Signiﬁ cant judgments include, 
among others, loan risk ratings and classiﬁ cations, the determination and 
measurement of impaired loans, the timing of loan charge offs, the probability 
of loan defaults, the net loss exposure in event of loan defaults, qualitative 
loss factors, management’s plans, if any, for disposition of certain loans 
as well as other qualitative considerations. In determining an adequate allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, 

estimates, and assessments which are inherently subjective. The use of 
different estimates or assumptions could have a signiﬁ cant impact on 
provision for loan losses, allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans, 
loan charge-offs, and other credit metrics.
Commer
The allowance for loan losses related to commercial loans consists of two 
components: the allocated commercial loan allowance for loan losses and 
the unallocated commercial loan allowance for loan losses. The allocated 
allowance for commercial loans is based upon quarterly analyses of 
impaired commercial loans to determine the amount of speciﬁ c reserves 
(and/or loan charge-offs), if any, as well as an analysis of historical loan 
default experience, loan net loss experience and related qualitative factors, 
if appropriate, for categories of loans with similar risk attributes and further 
segregated by Synovus’ internal loan grading system. The unallocated 
allowance is considered necessary to provide for certain factors that affect 
the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio that are not fully captured 
in the allocated allowance for loan losses, as discussed further below.
Each loan is assigned a risk rating during its initial approval process. This 
process begins with a loan rating recommendation from the loan ofﬁ cer 
responsible for originating the loan. The loan rating recommendation 
is subject to approvals from other members of management, regional 
credit and/or loan committees depending on the size of the new loan 
and new loan’s credit attributes. Loan ratings are regularly reevaluated 
based upon annual scheduled credit reviews or on a more frequent basis 
if determined prudent by management. Semi-annual credit reviews are 
performed by Synovus’ regional credit department for borrowers with 
exposurmillion. Quarterly loan memoranda for all loan 
relationships in excess of $500,000 graded special mention or worse are 
prepared and reviewed by regional credit ofﬁ cers to ensure the loans are 
properly graded, classiﬁ ed, and reserved for, if applicable. Furthermore, an 
independent loan review function evaluates Synovus’ risk rating process 

on an on-going basis.On a quarterly basis, impaired loans are evaluated on a loan by loan basis 
with speciﬁ c reserves recorded as appropriate. For loans that are not 
considered impaired, the allocated allowance for loan losses is determined 
based upon expected loss (EL) factors which are applied to groupings 
of speciﬁ c loan types, by loan risk ratings. The EL is determined based 
upon a probability of default (PD) which is the probability that a borrower, 
segregated by loan type and loan risk grade, will default, and the estimated 
loss given default (LGD) which is the estimate of the amount of net loss in the event of a loan defaulting. The allocated EL factors for commercial loans 
may also be adjusted, as necessary, by qualitative factor considerations 
for the applicable loan categories, which primarily include the aging of portfolio default experience data used in the PD calculation and the aging 
of the portfolio net loss experience data used in the LGD calculation. The 
groupings of the loans into loan categories for purposes of determining 
LGD are determined based upon the nature of the collateral types and 
the level of inherent risk associated with the various loan categories. The 
loan groupings are further segregated for purposes of determining PD 
based upon the individual loan type and risk ratings, as described above.As a result of Synovus’ past practice of updating default and loss–given 
default data once per year, loan default and net loan loss upon default 
data utilized in the PD and LGD calculations did not historically include the most recent periods’ portfolio default and net loss experience; therefore, 

these factors required a qualitative factor adjustment to properly capture 
the estimated inherent risk of loss in the respective loan portfolios not 
identiﬁ ed in the PD or LGD factors because of the time lag in the data 
used for the PD and LGD factors.In 2011, Synovus began updating the loan default data and net loss 
upon default data utilized in the calculation of the PD factors and LGD 
factors, respectively, at least twice a year. The use of this more current 
data in the PD and LGD calculations eliminated the need for the qualitative 
2011. 
2011 the PD factors are based upon loan defaults 
experienced thr2011, and the LGD factors are 
based upon losses on defaulted loans thr2011. The 
use of relatively current Synovus data in the PD and LGD calculations 
continued to require no qualitative adjustment to the EL factors as of 
2011. The one quarter lag in the data used to determine 
2011 did not have a 
material effect on these calculations.
Further, management evaluates loan default and net loan loss data through 
the issuance date of its consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in order to assess 
if defaults and losses during this period had a signiﬁ cant impact on the 
EL factors calculated for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses at the respective date of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
2011 and 
through the issuance date of Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
did not have a signiﬁ cant impact on EL factors, or the adequacy of the 
2011 or the provision for 
79.
PAR 
Prior to the change made in the second quarter of 2011, as described 
above, the LGD factors were calculated based upon net loan loss data 
on loans that had defaulted through Mar2009 and the net losses 
on those loans thr2010. As a result of this timing 
lag, Synovus previously supplemented its internal LGD data with industry 
LGD data at a weighting of 75% external industry data and 25% internal 
data. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, Synovus enhanced its 
EL methodology to incorporate more recent net losses on more recently 
defaulted loans in the calculation of the LGD. The enhanced LGD calculation 
includes loan defaults and net charge-off data thr2011, 
which reduced the timing lag, discussed above. Accordingly, it is no longer 
considered necessary to supplement Synovus’ internal net loss given 
default data with external industry net loss data and, as noted above, a 
Commercial Unallocated Reserve
The commercial unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is 
considered necessary to provide for certain environmental and economic 
factors that affect the inherent risk of loss in the entire loan portfolio that are 
not fully captured in the allocated allowance for loan losses. Unallocated 
qualitative factors included in the determination of the commercial unallocated 
allowance for loan losses include the following: •economic conditions; •changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management 
and loan review staff;
 •changes in the loan origination and monitoring policies and procedures;
 •changes in the volume and trend of impaired loans and past-due loans;
 •changes in concentrations and volume and nature of loan growth;
 •risk of grading not keeping pace with the speed and depth of deterioration 
in economic conditions, particularly related to identifying special mention 
credits;
 •estimated risk associated with the deterioration in the fair value of 
collateral supporting Synovus’ loans; and •other external impacts (as may be applicable).
On a quarterly basis, management updates its analysis and consideration of these factors and determines the impact, if any, on the allowance for 
loan losses for each respective period.
The allowance for loan losses related to retail loans consists of two 
components: the allocated retail loan allowance for loan losses and the 
unallocated retail loan allowance for loan losses. The allocated allowance 
for retail loans includes reserves for pools of homogenous loans and for 
impaired loans, which are generally evaluated on a loan by loan basis with 
speciﬁ c reserves recorded, as appropriate. For loans that are not considered 
impaired, the allocated allowance for loan losses is determined based 
upon EL factors which are applied to groupings of speciﬁ c loan types, by 
loan risk rating. The unallocated allowance is considered necessary to 
provide for certain factors that affect the inherent risk of loss in the loan 
portfolio that is not captured in the allocated allowance for loan losses, 
as discussed further below.
The EL is determined based upon a PD which is the probability that a 
borrower, segregated by loan type and loan risk grade, will default, and 
the estimated LGD which is the estimate of the amount of net loss in the event of a loan defaulting. The allocated EL factors for retail type loans 
may also be adjusted, as necessary, by qualitative factor considerations for 
the applicable loan categories, which include among other considerations the timing difference in the expected loss data, imprecision in the retail 
LGD and PD data, and other factors speciﬁ c to each pool of homogenous 
retail loans. The qualitative factor adjustments, as applicable for certain 
retail pools, represent an adjustment to the EL for the inherent risk in the 
respective retail loan pools. The retail qualitative factors consider risks not 
captured in the calculation of the retail PD and LGD factors.
Default data and net loss upon default data utilized in the calculation of the PD factor and LGD factor are updated at least annually, and qualitative 
factors are evaluated quarterly to determine if adjustments are necessary. 
Default data utilized in the PD calculation includes loan defaults experienced 
thr2011. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, 
Synovus enhanced the process used to calculate LGD factors to incorporate 
internal net losses on defaulted retail loans thr2011.
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2011, as described above, the retail LGD 
factors were based on industry data. The fourth quarter of 2011 was the 
ﬁ rst reporting period when the internal LGD data was deemed to provide 
a better estimate than the industry LGD data.Retail loans are generally assigned a risk rating on a 6-point scale at the 
time of origination based primarily on credit bureau scores, with 1 assigned 
days past 
due, a 7-substandardays past due, the loan 
is generally downgraded to grade 9-loss rating and is generally charged off. The credit bureau based ratings are updated at least annually and the 
ratings based on the past due status are updated quarterly.
Retail Unallocated ReserveThe unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is considered 
necessary to provide for certain environmental and economic factors that 
impact the inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio. While most of the 
unallocated reserve pertains to the commercial loan portfolio, certain of 
the factors, which are discussed above in the 
Commercial Unallocated Reserve 
section, also impact our consideration of the inherent risk of 
loss for the retail portfolio, to the extent that such considerations are not 
included in the allocated EL factors.Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment, including bank owned branch locations and 
leasehold improvements, are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and amortization, which are computed using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements 
are depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life or the remainder 
of the lease. Synovus reviews long-lived assets, such as premises and 
equipment, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net 
assets acquired in purchased businesses, is tested for impairment at least 
annually, or more often when events or circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may be impaired. Synovus has established its annual 
Impairment is tested at the reporting unit (sub-segment) level involving two 
steps. Step 1 compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying 
value. If the fair value is greater than carrying value, there is no indication 
2 is performed when the fair value determined in 
Step 1 is less than the reporting unit’2 involves a 
process similar to business combination accounting where fair values are 
assigned to all assets, liabilities, and intangibles. The re2 is 
2 implied fair value of goodwill 
is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for 
the difference. The total of all reporting unit fair values is compared for 
reasonableness to Synovus’ market capitalization plus a control premium.
Signiﬁ cant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. 
This judgment includes developing cash ﬂ ow projections, selecting 
appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, 
incorporating general economic and market conditions, and selecting an 80.
PAR 
appropriate control premium. The selection and weighting of the various 
fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment 
is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of 
fair value.Identiﬁ able intangible assets relate primarily to core deposit premiums, 
resulting from the valuation of core deposit intangibles acquired in business 
combinations or in the purchase of branch ofﬁ ces, customer relationships, 
and customer contract premiums resulting from the acquisition of investment 
advisory businesses. These identiﬁ able intangible assets are amortized using 
accelerated methods over periods not exceeding the estimated average remaining life of the existing customer deposits, customer relationships, 
or contracts acquired. Amortization periods range fryears. 
Amortization periods for intangible assets are monitored to determine if 
events and circumstances require such periods to be reduced.
Identiﬁ able intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of 
an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the intangible assets 
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to 
future undiscounted cash ﬂ ows expected to be generated by the asset. 

If such assets are considered impaired, the amount of impairment to be 
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of 
the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on the discounted 
expected future cash ﬂ ows to be generated by the assets.
Other Real EstateORE consists of properties obtained through a foreclosure proceeding 
or through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. A loan 
is classiﬁ ed as an in-substance foreclosure when Synovus has taken 
possession of the collateral regardless of whether formal foreclosure 
proceedings have taken place.
ORE is reported at the lower of cost or fair value determined on the 
basis of current appraisals, which consider comparable sales, and other 
estimates of fair value obtained principally from independent sources, 
adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in absorption rates or 
market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values 
considering management’s plans for disposition, which could result in an 
adjustment to lower the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. 
At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, any excess of 
the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral, less 
costs to sell, is recorded as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. 
Revenue and expenses from ORE operations as well as gains or losses 
on sales and any subsequent declines in the fair value are recorded as 
foreclosed real estate expense, net a component of non-interest expense 
on the consolidated statements of operations. Synovus requires that new 
appraisals be obtained on an annual basis for other real estate owned.
It is Synovus’ objective to dispose of ORE properties in a timely manner 
and to maximize net sale proceeds to the Company. Synovus has a 
centralized managed assets division, with the specialized skill set to 
facilitate this objective. While there is not a deﬁ ned timeline for their sale, 
these ORE properties are actively marketed through unafﬁ liated third 
parties, including real estate brokers and real estate auctioneers. Sales 
are made on an opportunistic basis, as acceptable buyers and terms are 
identiﬁ ed. In addition, Synovus also sells ORE properties in bulk asset 
sales to unafﬁ liated third parties. In some cases, Synovus is approached 
by potential buyers of ORE properties or Synovus may contact independent 
third parties who we believe might have an interest in an ORE property.
Other AssetsOther assets include accrued interest receivable and other signiﬁ cant 
balances as described below.
Investments in Company-Owned Life Insurance 
PoliciesInvestments in company-owned life insurance policies on certain current 
and former ofﬁ cers of Synovus are recorded at the net realizable value of 
the policies as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Net realizable value is the cash surrender value of the policies 
less any applicable surrender charges and any policy loans. Synovus 
has not borrowed against the cash surrender value of these policies. The 
appreciation in the cash surrender value of the policies is recognized as a 
component of other non-interest income in the consolidated statements 
of operations.Private Equity InvestmentsPrivate equity investments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated 
balance sheets with realized and unrealized gains and losses included 
in (decrease) increase in fair value of private equity investments, net on 
the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 946, 
— Investment Companies. For private equity investments, 
Synovus uses information provided by the fund managers in the initial 
determination of estimated fair value. Valuation factors, such as recent or 
proposed purchase or sale of debt or equity, pricing by other dealers in 
similar securities, size of position held, liquidity of the market, comparable market multiples, and changes in economic conditions affecting the issuer, 
are used in the ﬁ nal determination of estimated fair value.
Derivative InstrumentsSynovus’ risk management policies emphasize the management of 
interest rate risk within acceptable guidelines. Synovus’ objective in 
maintaining these policies is to achieve consistent growth in net interest 
income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates. Risks 
to be managed include both fair value and cash ﬂ ow risks. Utilization of 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments provides a valuable tool to assist in the 
management of these risks.In accor815, Derivatives and Hedging, all derivative 
instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their 
respective fair values, as components of other assets and other liabilities.
The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., unrealized gains or losses) 
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualiﬁ es as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for 
holding it. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a 

derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values, 
cash ﬂ ows, or foreign currencies. If the hedged exposure is a fair value 
exposure, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is 
recognized in earnings in the period of change, together with the offsetting 
unrealized loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being 
hedged as a component of other non-interest income on the consolidated 
statements of operations. If the hedged exposure is a cash ﬂ ow exposure, 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedged item is reported 
initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
(loss), net of the tax impact, and subsequently reclassiﬁ ed into earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded 
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, as well as the ineffective 
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, are reported in 
earnings immediately as a component of other non-interest income on 
the consolidated statements of operations. If the derivative instrument is 
not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings as a component of other non-interest income 
on the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. At 
2011, Synovus does not have any derivative instruments 

which are measured for ineffectiveness using the short-cut method.
With the exception of certain commitments to fund and sell ﬁ xed-rate 
mortgage loans and derivatives utilized to meet the ﬁ nancing and interest 
rate risk management needs of its customers, all derivatives utilized by 81.
PAR 
Synovus to manage its interest rate sensitivity are designated as either a 
hedge of a recognized ﬁ xed-rate asset or liability (fair value hedge), or a 
hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of future cash ﬂ ows 
of a ﬂ oating rate asset or liability (cash ﬂ ow hedge). Synovus does not 
speculate using derivative instruments.Synovus utilizes interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fair value 
risk of ﬁ xed-rate liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets primarily 
deposit and long-term debt liabilities. Fair value risk is measured as the 
volatility in the value of these liabilities as interest rates change. Interest 
rate swaps entered into to manage this risk are designed to have the same 
notional value, as well as similar interest rates and interest calculation 
methods. These agreements entitle Synovus to receive ﬁ xed-rate interest 
payments and pay ﬂ oating-rate interest payments based on the notional 
amount of the swap agreements. Swap agreements structured in this 
manner allow Synovus to effectively hedge the fair value risks of these 
ﬁ xed-rate liabilities. Ineffectiveness from fair value hedges is recognized in 
the consolidated statements of operations as other non-interest income. 
2011, there were no fair value hedges outstanding, and 
therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
Synovus is potentially exposed to cash ﬂ ow risk due to its holding of loans 
whose interest payments are based on ﬂ oating rate indices. Synovus monitors 
changes in these exposures and their impact on its risk management 
activities and uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash 
ﬂ ow risk. These agreements entitle Synovus to receive ﬁ xed-rate interest 
payments and pay ﬂ oating-rate interest payments. These agreements 
also allow Synovus to offset the variability of ﬂ oating rate loan interest 
received with the variable interest payments paid on the interest rate 
swaps. The ineffectiveness from cash ﬂ ow hedges is recognized in the 
consolidated statements operations as other non-interest income. At 
2011, there were no cash ﬂ ow hedges outstanding, and 
therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
In 2005, Synovus entered into certain forward starting swap contracts 
to hedge the cash ﬂ ow risk of certain forecasted interest payments on a 
forecasted debt issuance. Upon the determination to issue debt, Synovus 
was potentially exposed to cash ﬂ ow risk due to changes in market interest 
rates prior to the placement of the debt. The forward starting swaps 
allowed Synovus to hedge this exposure. Upon placement of the debt, 
these swaps were cash settled concurrent with the pricing of the debt. 
The effective portion of the cash ﬂ ow hedge included in accumulated 
other comprehensive income is being amortized over the life of the debt 
issue as an adjustment to interest expense.
Synovus also holds derivative instruments which consist of commitments to 
fund ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans to customers (interest rate lock commitments) 
and forward commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities and individual 
ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans. Synovus’ objective in obtaining the forward 
commitments is to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the interest 
rate lock commitments and the mortgage loans that are held for sale. 
Both the interest rate lock commitments and the forward commitments 
are reported at fair value, with adjustments recorded in current period 
earnings in mortgage banking income.
Synovus also enters into interest rate swap agreements to meet the ﬁ nancing 
and interest rate risk management needs of its customers. Upon entering 
into these derivative instruments to meet customer needs, Synovus enters 
into offsetting positions to minimize interest rate risk. These derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments are reported at fair value with any unrealized gain 
or loss recorded in current period earnings in other non-interest income. 
These instruments, and their offsetting positions, are recorded in other 
assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.By using derivatives to hedge fair value and cash ﬂ ow risks, Synovus 
exposes itself to potential credit risk from the counterparty to the hedging 
instrument. This credit risk is normally a small percentage of the notional 
amount and ﬂ uctuates as interest rates change. Synovus analyzes and 
approves credit risk for all potential derivative counterparties prior to execution 
of any derivative transaction. Synovus seeks to minimize credit risk by 
dealing with highly rated counterparties and by obtaining collateralization 
for exposures above certain predetermined limits. If signiﬁ cant counterparty 
risk is determined, Synovus adjusts the fair value of the derivative recorded 
asset balance to consider such risk.Non-interest Income
Service Charges on Deposit AccountsService charges on deposit accounts consist of non-sufﬁ cient funds 
fees, account analysis fees, and other service charges on deposits which 
consist primarily of monthly account fees. Non-sufﬁ cient funds fees are 
recognized at the time when the account overdraft occurs in accordance 
with regulatory guidelines. Account analysis fees consist of fees charged 
to certain commercial demand deposit accounts based upon account 
activity (and reduced by a credit which is based upon cash levels in the 
account). These fees, as well as monthly account fees, are recorded under 
the accrual method of accounting.Fiduciary and Asset Management FeesFiduciary and asset management fees are generally determined based 
upon market values of assets under management as of a speciﬁ ed date 

during the period. These fees are recorded under the accrual method of 

accounting as the services are performed.
Brokerage and Investment Banking Revenue
Brokerage revenue consists primarily of commission income, which 
represents the spread between buy and sell transactions processed, and 
net fees charged to customers on a transaction basis for buy and sell 
transactions processed. Commission income is recorded on a trade-date 
basis. Brokerage revenue also includes portfolio management fees which 
represent monthly fees charged on a contractual basis to customers for 
the management of their investment portfolios and are recorded under 
the accrual method of accounting.Investment banking revenue represents fees for services arising from 
securities offerings or placements in which Synovus acts as an agent. It 
also includes fees earned from providing advisory services. Revenue is 
recognized at the time the underwriting is completed and the revenue is 

reasonably determinable.
Bankcard Fees
Bankcard fees consist primarily of interchange fees earned, net of fees 
paid, on debit card and credit card transactions. Net fees are recognized 
into income as they are collected.
Income Taxes
Synovus is a domestic corporation that ﬁ les a consolidated federal income 
tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and ﬁ les state income tax 
returns on a consolidated and a separate entity basis with the various 
taxing jurisdictions based on its taxable presence. Synovus accounts for 
income taxes in accorIncome Taxes. The current 
income tax accrual or receivable is an estimate of the amounts owed to 
or refunded from taxing authorities in which Synovus conducts business. 
It also includes increases and decreases in the amount of taxes payable 
for uncertain tax positions reported in tax returns for the current and/or 
prior years.Synovus uses the asset and liability method to account for future income 
taxes expected to be paid or received (i.e., deferred income taxes). Under 
this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the 
ﬁ nancial statement (GAAP) carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases, including operating losses and tax credit 
carry-forwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
82.
PAR 
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which 
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The 
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates 
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC 740-30-25 provides accounting guidance for determining when 
a company is required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred 
tax assets. A valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if, 
based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some 
portion of the asset may not be realized due to the inability to generate 
sufﬁ cient taxable income in the period and/or of the character necessary 
to utilize the beneﬁ t of the deferred tax asset. In making this assessment, 
all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset 
are considered including taxable income in prior carry-back years, future 
reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and 
future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 
carry-forwards. The predictability that future taxable income, exclusive of 
reversing temporary differences, will occur is the most subjective of these 
four sources. The presence of cumulative losses in recent years is considered 
signiﬁ cant negative evidence, making it difﬁ cult for a company to rely on 
future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and 
carry-forwards, as a reliable source of taxable income to realize a deferred 
tax asset. Judgment is a critical element in making this assessment. 
Changes in the valuation allowance that result from favorable changes 
in those circumstances involving the credit quality of loans that cause a 
change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future 
years are recorded through income tax expense.
Signiﬁ cant estimates used in accounting for income taxes relate to the 
determination of taxable income, the determination of temporary differences 
between book and tax bases, the valuation allowance for deferred tax 
assets, as well as estimates on the realizability of income tax credits and 
utilization of net operating losses.Income tax expense or beneﬁ t for the year is allocated among continuing 
operations, discontinued operations, and other comprehensive income 
(loss), as applicable. The amount allocated to continuing operations 
is the income tax effect of the pretax income or loss from continuing 
operations that occurred during the year, plus or minus the income tax 
efchanges in circumstances that cause a change in judgment 
about the realization of deferred tax assets in futurchanges in 
changes in income tax status, subject 
to certain exceptions.Synovus accrues tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome through an 
examination process by weighing the facts and circumstances available 

at the reporting date. If related tax beneﬁ ts of a transaction are not more 
likely than not of being sustained upon examination, Synovus will accrue a 
tax liability for the expected taxes associated with the transaction. Events and circumstances may alter the estimates and assumptions used in the 
analysis of its income tax positions and, accordingly, Synovus’ effective 
tax rate may ﬂ uctuate in the future. Synovus also recognizes accrued 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax beneﬁ ts as a 
component of income tax expense.Share-based Compensation
Synovus has a long-term incentive plan under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to grant share-based 
awards to Synovus employees. Synovus’ share-based compensation costs 
are recorded as a component of salaries and other personnel expense in 
the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based compensation 
expense for service-based awards is recognized net of estimated forfeitures 
for plan participants on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
Fair value estimates are made at a speciﬁ c point in time, based on relevant 
market information and other information about the ﬁ nancial instrument. 
These estimates do not reﬂ ect any premium or discount that could result 
from offering for sale, at one time, the entire holdings of a particular 
ﬁ nancial instrument. Because no market exists for a portion of the ﬁ nancial 
instruments, fair value estimates are also based on judgments regarding 
estimated cash ﬂ ows, current economic conditions, risk characteristics 
of various ﬁ nancial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are 
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of signiﬁ cant 
judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes 
in assumptions could signiﬁ cantly affect the estimates.
Management employs independent third-party pricing services to provide 
fair value estimates for Synovus’ investment securities available for sale, trading account assets, and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments. Fair values 
for ﬁ xed income investment securities and certain derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments are typically the prices supplied by the third-party pricing 
service, which utilize quoted market prices, broker/dealer quotations 
for identical or similar securities, and/or inputs that are observable in 
the market, either directly or indirectly, for substantially similar securities. 
Level 1 securities are typically exchange quoted prices. Level 2 and Level 
3 securities are typically matrix priced by the third-party pricing service to 
calculate the fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable 
data such as relevant broker/dealer quotes, market spreads, cash ﬂ ows, 
yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayments speeds, credit information, and the respective terms and 
conditions for debt instruments.Management uses various validation procedures to validate the prices 
received from pricing services and quotations received from dealers are 
reasonable for each relevant ﬁ nancial instrument, including reference to 
relevant broker/dealer quotes or other market quotes and a review of 
valuations and trade activity of comparable securities. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or ﬁ rm) and the relationship 
of recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided by the third-

party pricing service. Further, management also employs the services of 
an additional independent pricing ﬁ rm as a means to verify and conﬁ rm 
the fair values of our primary independent pricing ﬁ rms.
Understanding the third-party pricing service’s valuation methods, 
assumptions and inputs used by the ﬁ rm is an important part of the 
process of determining that reasonable and reliable fair values are being 
obtained. Management evaluates quantitative and qualitative information provided by the third-party pricing services to assess whether they 
continue to exhibit the high level of expertise and internal controls that 
management relies upon.
Fair value estimates are based on existing ﬁ nancial instruments on the 
consolidated balance sheet, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are 
not considered ﬁ nancial instruments. Signiﬁ cant assets and liabilities that 
are not considered ﬁ nancial instruments include deferred income taxes, 
premises and equipment, equity method investments, goodwill and other 
intangible assets. In addition, the income tax ramiﬁ cations related to the 
realization of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment 
securities and cash ﬂ ow hedges can have a signiﬁ cant effect on fair value 
estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.
Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting 
Standards Updates
Ef2011, Synovus adopted ASU 2011-02, A Creditor’s 
Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring. 
The ASU provides additional guidance to assist creditors in determining 
whether a modiﬁ cation of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a 
TDR, both for purposes of recognizing loan losses and additional disclosures 
regarding TDRs. A modiﬁ cation of a credit arrangement constitutes a 
TDR if it constitutes a concession and the debtor is experiencing ﬁ nancial 
difﬁ culties. The clariﬁ cation for classiﬁ cation of loans as TDRs that was 
provided in ASU 2011-02, was applied to all debt restructurings occurring 
2011, and the measurement of impairment for 
those newly identiﬁ ed TDRs was applied prospectively beginning on 
2011. The related disclosures, which were previously deferred by 
83.
PAR 
ASU 2011-01, were also included for the interim reporting period ending 
2011, and will be included for subsequent reporting 
periods. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2011-02, Synovus’ level of 
TDRs increased by apprmillion at the date of adoption. 
The overall level of the allowance for loan losses did not materially change 
as a result of the increase in TDRs.
2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill 
for Impairment (the revised standard). Under the new standard, an entity 
has the option to ﬁ rst assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is 
necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a 
result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative 
impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An 
entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Moreover, an entity can bypass the qualitative 
assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to 
step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative 
assessment in any subsequent period. The revised standard is effective 
for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for ﬁ scal years 
2011. However, an entity can choose to 
early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the ﬁ nal 
standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual 
impairment test or issued its ﬁ nancial statements. Synovus is currently 
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2011-03 on its current approach 
to evaluating goodwill impairment, and at this point, does not anticipate making signiﬁ cant changes to the current approach that has been applied 
on a historic basis when applying the new guidance.2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, “Balance Sheet (Topic 
210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.” The ASU requires 
additional disclosures about ﬁ nancial instruments and derivative instruments 
that are offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement 
or similar agreement. The ASU is effective for the interim reporting period 
ending Mar2013 with retrospective disclosure for all comparative 
periods presented. The Company is evaluating the impact of the ASU; 
however, it is not expected to materially impact the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
position, results of operations, or EPS.
Reclassiﬁ cationsPrior years’ consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are reclassiﬁ ed whenever 
necessary to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Subsequent EventsSynovus has evaluated, for consideration or disclosure, all transactions, 
events, and circumstances subsequent to the date of the consolidated 
balance sheet and through the date the accompanying audited consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements were issued, and has reﬂ ected or disclosed those 
items within the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements and related footnotes 
as deemed appropriate, if any.

business. The sale was completed on Mardingly, the

2011, Synovus announced efﬁ ciency and growth initiatives 
intended to streamline operations, boost productivity, reduce expenses, 
and increase r2011, Synovus 
recognized remillion associated with these 
initiatives. As part of these efﬁ ciency initiatives, during the year ended 
2011 Synovus closed 31 branches and transferred premises 
million immediately preceding 
the transfer to other assets held for sale, a component of other assets 
on the consolidated balance sheet. During 2011, Synovus recognized 
million upon transfer of these assets to other 
assets held for sale and received prmillion from sales of 
these assets. The carrying value of the remaining held for sale assets was 
2010 and 2009, Synovus recognized 
apprmillion, in restructuring charges, 
respectively, related to other cost saving strategies.
The liability for r2011 
which consists primarily of estimated severance payments and lease 
termination payments. Cash payments associated with this liability are 
expected to occur over the next six months.Severance charges were recognized in accordance with the one-
time employee termination beneﬁ t provisions of ASC 420-10-25 upon 
management’s commitment to a plan identifying the number of employees 
to be terminated, the terms of the beneﬁ t arrangement, and upon 
communication of this information to the employees to be terminated. While recognition of restructuring charges is triggered by communication 
of the plan and beneﬁ t information to affected employees, the timing of 
recognition depends on whether an employee is required to render further 
service in order to receive the termination beneﬁ ts. For employees who 
are not required to render further service to receive termination beneﬁ ts 
or who are not required to render service beyond a minimum retention 
ecognized on the date of communication 
to affected employees. For employees who are required to work beyond 
the minimum retention period to receive termination beneﬁ ts, the fair value 
of termination beneﬁ ts at the communication date is recognized ratably 
over the future service period.
In accordance with ASC 360-10-35, restructuring charges were recognized 
upon a signiﬁ cant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-
lived asset is being used (removed from service), or upon management’s 
commitment to a plan to sell an asset. Restructuring charges resulting 
from lease termination expenses were recognized in accordance with ASC 
840-20 and ASC 840-30 upon notifying the lessor of Synovus’ intent to terminate a lease.Trading Account Assets

Other Loans Held for Sale
Loans are transferred to other loans held for sale at fair value when Synovus 
makes the determination to sell speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed loans. The fair value 
of the loans is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of 
the loan and the anticipated market prices of similar assets less estimated costs to sell. At the time of transfer, if the fair value is less than the carrying 
amount, the difference is recorded as a charge-off against the allowance 
for loan losses. Decreases in the fair value subsequent to the transfer, as 
well as gains/losses realized from sale of these loans, are recognized as 
(gains) losses on other loans held for sale, net as a component of non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
2010, and 2009, Synovus 
transferred loans with a carrying value immediately preceding the transfer 
million, respectively, to 
other loans held for sale. Synovus recognized charge-offs upon transfer 
million 
2010, and 2009, respectively. 
Charge-offs resulted in a new cost basis (fair value less costs to sell) of 
million, respectively, for the 
loans transferr2010, and 
2009; and were based on the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, of 
the loans at the time of transfer.

(1) Amortized cost is adjusted for other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2011 and 2010, which have been recognized in the 
consolidated statements of operations in the applicable period, and were considered inconsequential.
2011 and 2010, investment securities with a carrying 
billion, respectively, were pledged to 
secure certain deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, 
payment network arrangements, and FHLB advances as required by law 
and contractual agreements.
Synovus has reviewed investment securities that are in an unrealized loss 
2011 and 2010 for other-than-temporary 
impairment and does not consider any securities in an unrealized loss 
position to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Synovus does not intend to 
sell any of the investment securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized 
loss, which may be until maturity, and it is not more likely than not that 
Synovus will be required to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss 
position. The unrealized losses are related to increases in interest rates 
on comparable securities from the date of purchase. Synovus regularly 
evaluates its investment securities portfolio to ensure that there are no 
conditions that would indicate that unrealized losses represent other-
than-temporary impairment. These factors include length of time that the security has been in a loss position, the extent that the fair value has been 
below amortized cost, and the credit standing of the issuer.
Gross unrealized losses on investment securities and the fair value of 
the related securities, aggregated by investment category and length of 
time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss

The credit quality of the loan portfolio is summarized no less frequently than 
quarterly using the standard asset classiﬁ cation system utilized by the federal 
banking agencies. These classiﬁ cations are divided into three gr– Not 
Classiﬁ ed (Pass), Special Mention, and Classiﬁ ed or Adverse rating (Substandard, 
Doubtful, and Loss) and are deﬁ ned as follows:
- 
loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying 
capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.
- 
loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. These loans are not adversely classiﬁ ed 
and do not expose an institution to sufﬁ cient risk to warrant an adverse 
classiﬁ cation.
Substandar-
 loans which are inadequately protected by the current net 
worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. 
Loans with this classiﬁ cation are characterized by the distinct possibility that 
the institution will sustain some loss if the deﬁ ciencies are not corrected.
- 
loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classiﬁ ed 
as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make 
collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the 
basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values.
-
 loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible 
and of such little value that its continuance on the institution’s books 
as an asset, without establishment of a speciﬁ c valuation allowance or 
charge-off is not warranted.

Series A Preferred Stock
2008, Synovus issued to the Trshares 
of Synovus’ Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferr
A Preferred Stock”), having a liquidation 
amount per share equal to $1,000, for a total price of $967,870,000. The 
A Preferred Stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per 
year for the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. Synovus 
may, at its option, with the consent of the FDIC, redeem, in whole or in 
part, the Series A Preferred Stock at the liquidation amount per share plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock is generally 
non-voting. However, if Synovus fails to pay dividends on the Series A 
Preferred Stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods, whether or not 
consecutive, the number of authorized directors will be increased by 
two and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right 
to elect two directors. A consequence of the Series A Preferred Stock 
purchase includes certain restrictions on executive compensation that 
could limit the tax deductibility of compensation that Synovus pays to executive management.As part of its purA Preferred Stock, Synovus issued 
the Treasury a warrant to purshares of Synovus 
common stock («Warrant») at an initial per share exercise price of $9.36. 
The Warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the 
number of shares of Synovus common stock issuable upon exercise 
pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, such as upon stock splits 
or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of Synovus common 
stock, and upon certain issuances of Synovus common stock at or below 
a speciﬁ ed price relative to the initial exercise price. The Warrant expires 
2018. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, 
the Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any 
shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant.
The ofeferred Stock and the Warrant were 
effected without registration under the Securities Act in reliance on the 
exemption from r4(2) of the Securities Act. 
Synovus has allocated the total proceeds received frStates 
Department of the Treasury based on the rA 
Preferred Stock and the Warrants. This allocation resulted in the preferred 
shares and the Warrants being initially recorded at amounts that are less 
than their respective fair values at the issuance date.
A Preferred Stock is being accreted 
using a constant effective yield over the ﬁ ve-year period preceding the 9% 
perpetual dividend. Synovus records increases in the carrying amount of 
the preferred shares resulting from accretion of the discount by charges 
against accumulated deﬁ cit.

price of $4.00 per share, generating prmillion, net of

Exchange of Subordinated Debt for Common 
Stock2009, Synovus completed an exchange offer («Exchange 
Offer») of $29,820,000 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 
Subordinated Notes Due 2013 (the «2013 Notes»). The 2013 Notes 
exchanged in the Exchange Offer represent 12.6% of the $236,570,000 
aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes outstanding prior to the 
Exchange Offer. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, Synovus 
million shares of Synovus’ common stock, at a fair value 
million, as consideration for the 2013 Notes. The Exchange 
Offer resulted in a prmillion which was recorded as a 
component of other non-interest income in 2009.
tMEDS2010, Synovus completed a public offering of 13,800,000 tMEDS 
with a stated value of $25.00 per unit. Each tMEDS unit consists of a prepaid 
common stock purchase contract and a junior subordinated amortizing note 
2013. The prepaid common stock purchase contracts have been 
recorded as additional paid-in capital (a component of shareholders’ equity), 
net of issuance costs, and the junior subordinated amortizing notes have 
been recorded as long-term debt. Issuance costs associated with the debt 
component were recorded as a prepaid expense which is being amortized 
2013. 
Synovus allocated the proceeds from the issuance of the tMEDS to equity 
and debt based on the relative fair values of the respective components of 
each tMEDS unit. The aggregate values assigned to each component of the 
tMEDS offering are as follows:

2013; and (3) an 
assumed discount rate of 10%. The discount rate used for estimating 
the fair value was determined by obtaining yields for comparably-rated issuers trading in the market, considering the market yield of existing 
Synovus subordinated debt, the credit rating of Synovus, as well as the 
junior nature of the new debt. The debt component was recorded at fair 
value, and the discount is being amortized using the level yield method The fair value of the equity component was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions: 
(1) risk-free interest rate of 1.77%; (2) expected stock price volatility of 
60%; (c) dividend yield of 1.45%; and (4) term of 3.03 years.99.

Capital
Synovus is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the 
federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements 
can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions 
by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and 
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Synovus must meet 
speciﬁ c capital levels that involve quantitative measures of both on- and 
off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory capital guidelines. 
Capital amounts and classiﬁ cation are also subject to qualitative judgments 
by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
As a ﬁ nancial holding company, Synovus and its subsidiary bank, Synovus 
Bank, are required to maintain capital levels required for a well-capitalized 
institution as deﬁ ned by federal banking regulations. The capital measures 
used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk-based capital 
ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio. Synovus Bank 
is a state-chartered bank under the regulations of the GA DBF. Under 
applicable regulations, Synovus Bank is well-capitalized if it has a total 
risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or 
greater, a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any written 
agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive 
from a federal and/or state banking regulatory agency to meet and maintain 
a speciﬁ c capital level for any capital measure. However, even if Synovus 
Bank satisﬁ es all applicable quantitative criteria to be considered well-
capitalized, the regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an 
institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other 2010, Synovus Bank entered into a memorandum 
of understanding with the FDIC and the GA DBF agreeing to maintain a 
minimum leverage ratio of 8% and a minimum total risk-based capital 
to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%. Management believes that, as 
2011, Synovus and Synovus Bank meet all capital 
requirements to which they are subject.
Management currently believes, based on current internal capital analyses 
and earnings projections, that Synovus’ capital position is adequate to 
meet current regulatory minimum capital requirements. However, Synovus 
continues to actively monitor economic conditions, evolving industry capital 
standards, and changes in regulatory standards and requirements, and 
engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at 
both Synovus and Synovus Bank. As part of its ongoing management of 
capital, Synovus will continue to identify, consider, and pursue additional 
strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary, 
including strategies in connection with any future repayment of Synovus’ 
obligations under the CPP.

NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS$(0.15)(1.24)(3.99)
Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the 
average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per 
common share reﬂ ects the dilution that could occur if securities or other 
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted. The dilutive 
effect of outstanding options and restricted shares is reﬂ ected in diluted 
earnings per share, unless the impact is anti-dilutive, by application of 
the treasury stock method.
Due to the net loss attributable to common shareholders for the years 
2010, and 2009, there were no potentially 
dilutive shares included in the net loss per common share calculations, as 
such shares and adjustments would have been anti-dilutive.
Fair Value Accounting
Synovus carries various assets and liabilities at fair value based on the fair 
value accounting guidance under ASC 820 and ASC 825. Fair value is deﬁ ned 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability (an “exit price”) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on 
the measurement date. Synovus determines the fair values of its ﬁ nancial 
instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-
10, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and 
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There 
are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. A ﬁ nancial 
instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the 
lowest level of input that is signiﬁ cant to the fair value measurement. The three 
levels of inputs are as follows:
reasury securities 
that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.
hat are not 
active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
 the assets e traded less frequently than 
exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the mar
ket or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Govern
ment sponsored agency securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and agencies, obligatio
ns of states and municipalities, collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, derivative c
ontracts, and mortgage loans held-for-sale. Certain private equity investments that hold mutual fund investments that invest in publicly 
traded companies ar
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little if any market activity for the asset or liability
ies include ﬁ nancial 
instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash ﬂ ow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well 
as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires signiﬁ cant management judgment or estimation. This category pri
marily includes collateral-dependent impaired loans, other real estate, certain equity investments, and certain private equity investm
ents and certain derivative contracts.102.
PAR 
Fair Value Option
Synovus has elected the fair value option for mortgage loans held for 
sale primarily to ease the operational burdens required to maintain hedge 
accounting for these loans. Synovus is still able to achieve effective economic 
hedges on mortgage loans held for sale without the operational time and expense needed to manage a hedge accounting program.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the 
major categories of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Trading Account Assets and Investment 
Securities Available-for-Sale
The fair values of trading account assets and investment securities available-for-sale are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are 
based on either quoted market prices or observed transactions. These securities are classiﬁ 1 within the valuation hierarchy and include 
U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities. Liquidity is a signiﬁ cant factor 
in the determination of the fair value of certain trading account assets and liabilities and certain available-for-sale securities. The fair values of these 
instruments also take into account recent market activity as well as other 
market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment 
information, volatility, and U.S. Treasury and swap curves. When quoted 
market prices are not available, which generally occurs due to the lack 
of liquidity for certain securities, fair values are estimated using bid prices 
and quoted market prices of pool or tranches of securities with similar characteristics. These types of securities are classiﬁ 2 within 
the valuation hierarchy and primarily consist of collateralized mortgage 
obligations, mortgage-backed debt securities, debt securities of U.S. 
Government-sponsored enterprises and agencies, corporate debt, and state 
and municipal bonds. Synovus has evaluated the valuation methodologies 
of its third-party pricing services to determine whether such valuations 
are representative of an exit price in Synovus’ principal markets. In a few 
cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to 
valuation, securities are classiﬁ 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
Mortgage Loans Held for SaleSynovus elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell to investors. When quoted market prices are not 
available, fair value is derived from a hypothetical-securitization model 
used to estimate the “exit price” of the loans in securitization. The bid 
pricing convention is used for loan pricing for similar assets. The valuation model is based upon forward settlements of a pool of loans of identical 
coupon, maturity, product, and credit attributes. The inputs to the model 
are continuously updated with available market and historical data. As 
the loans are sold in the secondary market and predominantly used as 
collateral for securitizations, the valuation model represents the highest 
and best use of the loans in Synovus’ principal market. Mortgage loans 
held for sale are classiﬁ chy.
Private Equity InvestmentsPrivate equity investments include equity method investments in venture 
capital funds which are primarily classiﬁ 3 within the valuation 
hierarchy. The valuation of these investments requires signiﬁ cant management 
judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of 
liquidity, and the long-term nature of such assets. Based on these factors, 
the ultimate realizable value of these investments could differ signiﬁ cantly 
from the value reﬂ ected in the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements. Valuation factors such as recent or proposed purchase or sale 
of debt or equity of the issuer, pricing by other dealers in similar securities, 
size of position held, liquidity of the market, and changes in economic 
conditions affecting the issuer are used in the determination of fair value.
Also, Synovus holds an interest in a private equity investment that consists 
of a fund that invests in publicly traded ﬁ nancial services companies. 
Although the fund holds investments in publicly traded entities, the fair value of this investment is classiﬁ 2 in the valuation hierarchy 
because there is no actively traded market for the fund itself, and the value 
of the investment is based on the aggregate market value of the publicly 
traded companies that are held in the fund for investment.
Investments Held in Rabbi Trusts
The investments held in Rabbi Trusts primarily include mutual funds that 
invest in equity and ﬁ xed income securities. Shares of mutual funds are 
valued based on quoted market prices, which represents the net asset 
value of the shares and are therefore classiﬁ 1 of the fair 
value hierarchy.
Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesAs part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus 
utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types 
of interest rate risk. The majority of derivatives entered into by Synovus 
are executed over-the-counter and consist of interest rate swaps. The 
fair values of these derivative instruments are determined based on an 
internally developed model that uses readily observable market data, as 
quoted market prices are not available for these instruments. The valuation 
models and inputs depend on the type of derivative and the nature of 
the underlying instrument, and include interest rates, prices and indices 
to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, volatility factors, and 
customer credit related adjustments. The principal techniques used to 
model the value of these instruments are an income approach, discounted 
cash ﬂ ows, Black-Scholes or Binomial Pricing models. The sale of TBA 
mortgage-backed securities for current month delivery or in the future and 
the purchase of option contracts of similar duration are derivatives utilized 
by Synovus’ mortgage subsidiary, and are valued by obtaining prices directly 
from dealers in the form of quotes for identical securities or options using 
a bid pricing convention with a spread between bid and offer quotations. 
Interest rate swaps, ﬂ oors, caps and collars, and TBA mortgage-backed 
securities are classiﬁ chy.
The Company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans, which 
are classiﬁ ed as derivatives prior to the loan closing when there is a note 
lock commitment outstanding to a borrower to close the loan, if originated, 
at a speciﬁ c interest rate. The fair values of these derivative positions, are 
determined based on a bid pricing convention as mentioned above. The determination of fair value of interest rate lock commitments includes fall-out 
ratio assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately 
result in a closed loan, which is a signiﬁ cant unobservable assumption. 
Therefore, this type of derivative instrument is classiﬁ 3 within 
the valuation hierarchy. These amounts, however, are insigniﬁ cant.
2009, Synovus sold certain Visa Class B shares to another 
Visa USA member ﬁ nancial institution. The sales price was based on the 
Visa stock conversion ratio in effect at the time for conversion of Visa 
Class B shares to Visa Class A unrestricted shares at a future date. In 
conjunction with the sale, Synovus entered into a derivative contract with 
the purchaser (the Visa Derivative) which provides for settlements between 
the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of Visa Class 
B shares to Visa Class A shares. The fair value of the Visa derivative is 
measured using a discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology for estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows determined through use of probability weighting for estimates 
of Visa’s aggregate exposure to the Covered Litigation. The conversion 
rate derivative is classiﬁ 3 within the valuation hierarchy as 
the value is determined using discounted cash ﬂ ow methodologies and 
involves unobservable inputs which are not supported by market activity 
for the liability.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
on a Recurring BasisSynovus adopted certain of the new disclosure requirements of ASU 
2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, effective 
2010. The guidance requires fair value disclosures by class 
of assets and liabilities rather than by major category. For equity and 
debt securities, class was determined based on the nature and risks of 
the investments. Transfers between levels were inconsequential for the 
2011 and 2010. The following table presents

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
From time to time, certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a 
non-recurring basis. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically 
are a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or 
a write-down occurring during the period. For example, if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis, it is considered 
to be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment. In periods 
where there is no adjustment, the asset is generally not considered to be 
at fair value. The following table presents certain assets measured at fair 
value on a non-recurring basis for which a fair value adjustment had been

(1) Impaired loans that are collateral-dependent.
Loans are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of 
ASC 310-10-35 using the present value of the expected future cash ﬂ ows 
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, 
a loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the 
loan is collateral-dependent.Under the practical expedient, Synovus measures the fair value of collateral-
dependent impaired loans based on the fair value of the collateral securing 
these loans, less costs to sell. These measurements are classiﬁ ed as 
3 within the valuation hierarchy. A signiﬁ cant amount of nonaccrual 
impaired loans are secured by real estate and considered collateral-
dependent. The fair value of this real estate is generally determined based 
upon appraisals performed by a certiﬁ ed or licensed appraiser using 
inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates, and comparables, adjusted for estimated selling costs. Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in absorption rates 
or market conditions from the time of valuation, and anticipated sales 
values considering management plans for disposition, which could result 
in adjustment to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis 
for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly based on the same 
factors identiﬁ ed above.
The fair value of ORE is determined on the basis of current appraisals, 
comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from 
independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. An asset that is 
acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures is valued at the fair value of 
the asset less the estimated cost to sell. The transfer at fair value results in 
a new cost basis for the asset. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are 
updated periodically and assets are marked to current fair value but not 
to exceed the new cost basis. Determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure also considers management’s plans for disposition, including 
liquidation sales, which could result in adjustment to the collateral value 
estimates indicated in the appraisals.Other assets consist of certain premises and equipment held for sale, 
including those related to the efﬁ 2 
“Restructuring Charges” herein. These assets are classiﬁ ed as held for 
sale and recorded at the lower of their amortized cost or fair value, less 
costs to sell, consistent with ASC 360-10. The fair value of these assets is determined primarily on the basis of BOV or appraisals, as circumstances 
warrant. Both techniques engage licensed or certiﬁ ed professionals that 
use inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates, and comparables, 
adjusted for estimated selling costs.Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following table presents the carrying and fair values of ﬁ nancial 
2011 and 2010. The fair value represents 
management’s best estimates based on a range of methodologies and 
assumptions.Cash and due from banks, interest bearing funds with the Federal Reserve 
Bank, interest earning deposits with banks, and federal funds sold and 
securities purchased under resale agreements are repriced on a short-
term basis; as such, the carrying value closely approximates fair value.
The fair value of loans is estimated for portfolios of loans with similar ﬁ nancial 
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, mortgage, 
home equity, credit card, and other consumer loans. Commercial loans 
are further segmented into certain collateral code groupings. The fair value 
of the loan portfolio is calculated, in accordance with ASC 825-10-50, 
by discounting contractual cash ﬂ ows using estimated market discount 
rates which reﬂ ect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. 
This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price 
concept of fair value prescribed by ASC 820-10 and generally produces 

a higher value than a pure exit price approach.
The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest 
bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand deposits, money 
market accounts, and savings accounts, is estimated to be equal to the amount payable on demand as of that respective date. The fair value of 
time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash ﬂ ows. 
The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits 
of similar remaining maturities. Short-term debt that matures within ten 
days is assumed to be at fair value. The fair value of other short-term 
and long-term debt with ﬁ xed interest rates is calculated by discounting 

contractual cash ﬂ ows using estimated market discount rates.

Instruments
As part of its overall interest rate risk management activities, Synovus 
utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types 
of interest rate risk. These derivative instruments generally consist of 
interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments made to prospective 
mortgage loan customers, and commitments to sell ﬁ xed-rate mortgage 
loans. Interest rate lock commitments represent derivative instruments 
since it is intended that such loans will be sold.Synovus utilizes interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks primarily 
arising from its core banking activities. These interest rate swap transactions 
generally involve the exchange of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate interest rate 
payment obligations without the exchange of underlying principal amounts.2011, Synovus had no outstanding interest swap 
contracts utilized to manage interest rate risk. The notional amount of 
interest rate swap contracts utilized as part of overall interest rate risk

Cash Flow HedgesSynovus designates hedges of ﬂ oating rate loans as cash ﬂ ow hedges. 
These swaps hedge against the variability of cash ﬂ ows from speciﬁ ed pools 
of ﬂ oating rate prime based loans. Synovus calculates effectiveness of the 
hedging relationship quarterly using regression analysis. The effective portion 
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component 
of other comprehensive income and reclassiﬁ ed into earnings in the same 
period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 
Ineffectiveness from cash ﬂ ow hedges is recognized in the consolidated 

statements of operations as a component of other non-interest income. 
2011, there were no cash ﬂ ow hedges outstanding, 
and therefore, no cumulative ineffectiveness.
Synovus expects to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive 
million to pre-tax income during the next year as 
amortization of deferred gains (losses) are recorded.
Synovus did not terminate any cash ﬂ ow hedges during 2011. During 
2010, Synovus terminated certain cash ﬂ ow hedges, which resulted 
in a net prmillion. This gain has been recorded as 
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and 
is being amortized over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the 
maturity of the designated instrument as an adjustment to interest income.

Synovus designates hedges of ﬁ xed rate liabilities as fair value hedges.

Customer Related Derivative PositionsSynovus also enters into derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to meet the 
ﬁ nancing and interest rate risk management needs of its customers. Upon 
entering into these instruments to meet customer needs, Synovus enters into offsetting positions in order to minimize the interest rate risk. These 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are recorded at fair value with any resulting

Visa Derivative
In conjunction with the sale of Class B shares of common stock issued 
by Visa to Synovus as a Visa USA member, Synovus entered into a 
derivative contract with the purchaser, which provides for settlements 
between the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of 
Visa Class B shares to Visa Class A shares. The conversion ratio changes 
when Visa deposits funds to a litigation escrow established by Visa to 
pay settlements for certain litigation, which Visa is indemniﬁ ed by Visa 
USA members (the «Covered Litigation»). The litigation escrow is funded 
by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of Class B shares. The fair value of 
the derivative liability is based on an estimate of Synovus’ membership proportion of Visa’s aggregate exposure to the Covered Litigation, or in 
effect, the future cumulative deposits to the litigation escrow for settlement 
of the Covered Litigation.

PAR 
Mortgage DerivativesSynovus originates ﬁ rst lien residential mortgage loans for sale into the 
secondary market and generally does not hold the originated loans for investment purposes. Mortgage loans are sold by Synovus for conversion 
to securities and the servicing is sold to a third-party servicing aggregator, 
or the mortgage loans are sold as whole loans to investors either individually 
or in bulk on a servicing released basis.
2011 and 2010, Synovus had commitments to fund at 
a locked interest rate, primarily ﬁ xed-rate mortgage loans to customers in 
million, respectively. The fair value 
of these commitments at a locked inter2011 and 
2010, resulted in an unr
respectively, which was recorded as a component of mortgage banking 

income in the consolidated statements of operations.2011 and 2010 outstanding commitments to sell primarily 
ﬁ million, 
respectively. Such commitments are entered into to reduce the exposure 
to market risk arising from potential changes in interest rates, which could 
affect the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and outstanding 
commitments at a locked interest rate to originate residential mortgage 
loans for resale. The commitments to sell mortgage loans are at ﬁ xed 
prices and are scheduled to settle at speciﬁ ed dates that generally do 
not exceed 90 days. The fair value of outstanding commitments to sell 2011 and 2010 resulted in an unrealized 
million, respectively, which was recorded as a 
component of mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of operations.Counterparty Credit Risk and Collateral
Entering into derivative contracts potentially exposes Synovus to the risk of counterparties’ failure to fulﬁ ll their legal obligations, including, but not 
limited to, potential amounts due or payable under each derivative contract. 
Notional principal amounts are often used to express the volume of these 
transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much 
smaller. Synovus assesses the credit risk of its dealer counterparties by 
regularly monitoring publicly available credit rating information and other 
market indicators. Dealer collateral requirements are determined via risk-
based policies and procedures and in accordance with existing agreements. 
Synovus seeks to minimize dealer credit risk by dealing with highly rated 
counterparties and by obtaining collateral for exposures above certain 
predetermined limits. Management closely monitors credit conditions 
within the customer swap portfolio, which management deems higher risk than dealer counterparties. Collateral is secured at origination and credit 
related fair value adjustments are recorded against the asset value of the 
derivative as deemed necessary based upon an analysis, which includes consideration of the current asset value of the swap, customer credit 
rating, collateral value, and current economic conditions. The fair value of 
million as of 
2011 and 2010, respectively. Such asset values ﬂ uctuate 
based upon current interest rates regardless of changes in notional amounts 
and changes in customer speciﬁ c risk.
Collateral ContingenciesCertain of Synovus’ derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
Synovus to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major 
credit rating agencies. When Synovus’ credit rating falls below investment 
grade, these provisions allow the counterparties of the derivative instrument

Synovus has a contractual ownership or other interests in certain Variable 
Interest Entities («VIE»s) for which the fair value of the VIE’s net assets may 
change exclusive of the variable interests. Under ASC 810-10-65, Synovus 
is deemed to be the primary beneﬁ ciary and required to consolidate a VIE if 
it has a variable interest in the VIE that provides it with a controlling ﬁ nancial 
interest. For such purposes, the determination of whether a controlling 
ﬁ nancial interest exists is based on whether a single party has both the 
power to direct the activities of the VIE that most signiﬁ cantly impact the 
VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of 
the VIE or the right to receive beneﬁ ts from the VIE that could potentially 
be signiﬁ cant to the VIE. ASC 810-10-65, as amended, requires continual 
reconsideration of conclusions reached regarding which interest holder is 
a VIE’s primary beneﬁ ciary.
Synovus’ involvement with VIEs is discussed below. Synovus consolidates 
VIEs for which it is deemed the primary beneﬁ ciary.
Consolidated Variable Interest Entities
Rabbi T– 
Synovus has established certain rabbi trusts related to 
deferred compensation plans offered to its employees. Synovus contributes 
employee cash compensation deferrals to the trusts and directs the 
underlying investments made by the trusts. The assets of these trusts are available to creditors of Synovus only in the event that Synovus 
becomes insolvent. These trusts are considered VIEs because either there 
is no equity at risk in the trusts or because Synovus provided the equity 
interest to its employees in exchange for services rendered. Synovus is 
considered the primary beneﬁ ciary of the rabbi trusts as it has the ability 
to direct the underlying investments made by the trusts, the activities that 
most signiﬁ cantly impact the economic performance of the rabbi trusts. 
Synovus includes the assets of the rabbi trusts as a component of other assets and a corresponding liability for the associated beneﬁ t obligation in 
2011,

to development and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to

and are considered VIEs because Synovus, as the holder of an equity 
investment at risk, does not have voting or similar rights and does not participate in the management or direct the operations of the partnerships 
(activities which affect the success of the partnerships). Synovus provides 
construction lending for certain of the LIHTC partnerships in which it also has an equity investment. Synovus is at risk for the amount of its equity investment plus the outstanding amount of any construction loans in 
excess of the fair value of the collateral for the loan but has no obligation to fund the operations or working capital of the partnerships. The general partners of these partnerships are considered the primary beneﬁ ciaries

Certain Troubled Commer–
 For certain troubled commercial 
loans, Synovus restructures the terms of the borrower’s debt in an effort 
to increase the probability of receipt of amounts contractually due. A 
troubled debt restructuring generally requires consideration of whether 
the borrowing entity is a VIE as economic events have proven that the 
entity’s equity is not sufﬁ cient to permit it to ﬁ nance its activities without 
additional subordinated ﬁ nancial support or a restructuring of the terms of 
its ﬁ nancing. As Synovus does not have the power to direct the activities 
that most signiﬁ cantly impact such troubled commercial borrowers’ 
operations, it is not considered the primary beneﬁ ciary, even in situations 
where, based on the size of the ﬁ nancing provided, Synovus is exposed 
to potentially signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts and losses of the borrowing entity. 
Synovus has no contractual requirements to provide ﬁ nancial support to 
the borrowing entities beyond certain funding commitments established 
upon restructuring of the terms of the debt that allows for preparation of the 
underlying collateral for sale and the borrowing entity is considered a VIE.
Visa Shares and Related Agreement
Synovus is a member of the Visa USA network and received shares of Visa 
Class B common stock in exchange for its membership interest in Visa 
USA in conjunction with the public offering by the Visa IPO in 2008. Visa 
members have indemniﬁ cation obligations with respect to the Covered 
Litigation. Visa Class B shares are subject to certain restrictions until 
the latter of Mar2011 or settlement of the Covered Litigation. As of 
2011, the Covered Litigation had not been settled. Visa has 
established a litigation escrow to fund settlement of the Covered Litigation. 
The litigation escrow is funded by proceeds from Visa’s conversion of 
Class B shares.
The Visa IPO was completed in Marc2008. Immediately following 
completion of the Visa IPO in Mar2008, Visa redeemed a portion of 
the Class B shares of its common stock held by Visa members. Synovus 
recognized a prmillion on redemption of a portion 
of its Visa Class B shares. During 2008 and 2009, Synovus reduced 
its contingent liability for its indemniﬁ cation obligations upon events of 
Visa’s funding of litigation escrow through conversion of Class B shares 
as described above.2009, Synovus sold its remaining VB shares to another 
Visa USA member ﬁ million and recognized a 
million. In conjunction with the sale, Synovus entered 
into a derivative contract with the purchaser which provides for settlements 
between the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of 
ViB shares to ViA shares. The fair value of the derivative 
2011 and 2010, is 
based on an estimate of Visa’s exposure to liability based upon probability-
weighted potential outcomes of the Covered Litigation. The conversion 
rate from Visa Class B to Visa Class A shares changed once in 2011 and 
twice in 2010 in conjunction with Visa’s deposits to the litigation escrow of 
million 
million 
to the derivative counterparty during 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a 
result of the conversion rate changes associated with Visa’s deposits to the 
litigation escrow. Synovus increased the fair value of its derivative liability 
million and recognized a corresponding indemniﬁ cation charge 
to ear2011 in connection with the announcement of 
Visa’billion to the litigation escrow. Synovus paid 
a settlement to the derivative counterparty of apprmillion 
during the ﬁ rst quarter of 2012 following Visa’s deposit of the planned 
amount to the litigation escrow. Management believes that the estimate 
of Visa’s exposure to litigation liability is adequate based on current 
information; however, future developments in the litigation could require 
potentially signiﬁ cant changes to the estimate.

Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, Synovus enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments and letters of credit to meet the 
ﬁ nancing needs of its customers. Synovus uses the same credit policies in 
making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance 
sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend 
to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established 
in the contract. Commitments generally have ﬁ xed expiration dates or 
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
The contractual amount of these ﬁ nancial instruments represents Synovus’ 
maximum credit risk should the counterparty draw upon the commitment, 
and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to 
the terms of the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected 
to expire without being drawn upon, total commitment amounts do not 
necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The carrying amount of loan commitments and letters of credit closely 
approximates the fair value of such ﬁ nancial instruments. Carrying amounts 
include unamortized fee income and, in some instances, allowances for any 
estimated credit losses from these ﬁ nancial instruments. These amounts 
are not material to Synovus’ consolidated balance sheets.

Repurchase Obligations for Mortgage Loans 
Originated for SaleSubstantially all of the mortgage loans originated by Synovus Mortgage are sold to third-party purchasers on a servicing released basis, without 
recourse, or continuing involvement (Synovus Mortgage does not retain the 
servicing rights). These loans are originated and underwritten internally by 
Synovus personnel and are primarily to borrowers in Synovus’ geographic 
market footprint. These sales are typically effected as non-recourse loan 
sales to GSEs and non-GSE purchasers.
Each GSE and non-GSE purchaser has speciﬁ c guidelines and criteria 
for sellers of loans, and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal 

amount of the loans sold is generally transferred to the purchasers upon 
sale. While the loans are sold without recourse, the purchase agreements 
require Synovus Mortgage to make certain representations and warranties 
regarding the existence and sufﬁ ciency of ﬁ le documentation and the 
absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in 
connection with obtaining the loan. If it is determined that loans sold were 
in breach of these representations or warranties, Synovus Mortgage has 
obligations to either repurchase the loan at the unpaid principal balance 

and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for the economic 

beneﬁ ts of the loan.
To date, repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations 
and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with loans originated from 2005 through 2008. Fr2005 through 
2011, Synovus Mortgage originated and sold approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst lien GSE eligible mortgage loans and approximately 
billion of ﬁ rst and second lien non-GSE eligible mortgage loans. The 
total expense pertaining to losses from repurchases of mortgage loans 
previously sold, including amounts accrued in accordance with ASC 450, 
million, and $713 thousand for the years ended

Mortgage Loan Foreclosure Practices
billion 
billion, respectively of home equity and consumer mortgage 
loans which are secured by ﬁ rst and second liens on residential properties. 
Of this amount, apprmillion, respectively, 
consists of mortgages relating to properties in Florida and South Carolina 
which are states in which foreclosures proceed through the courts. To 
date, foreclosure activity in the home equity and consumer mortgage loan 
portfolio has been low. Any foreclosures on these loans are handled by 
designated Synovus personnel and external legal counsel, as appropriate, 
following established policies regarding legal and regulatory requirements. 
Based on information currently available, management believes that it does 
not have signiﬁ cant exposure to faulty foreclosure practices.
Proceedings
Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings and 
claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Additionally, in the 
ordinary course of business, Synovus and its subsidiaries are subject to 
regulatory examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries and 
investigations. Synovus carefully examines and considers each legal matter, 
and, in those situations where Synovus determines that a particular legal 
matter presents loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably 
estimable, Synovus establishes an appropriate accrual. An event is 
considered to be “probable” if “the future event is likely to occur.” To date, 
Synovus has not determined that any of the legal matters present loss 
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, including 
those described below, and, accordingly, has not established an accrual 
in respect of any such legal matters.
In addition, where Synovus determines that there is a reasonable possibility 
of a loss in respect of legal matters; Synovus considers whether it is 
able to estimate the total reasonably possible loss or range of loss. An 
event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events 
occurring is more than remote but less than likely.” An event is “remote” if 
“the chance of the event or future event occurring is more than slight” but 
less than reasonably possible. In many situations, Synovus may be unable 
to estimate reasonably possible losses due to the preliminary nature of 
the legal matters, as well as a variety of other factors and uncertainties. 
For those legal matters where Synovus is able to estimate a range of 
reasonably possible losses, Synovus’ management currently estimates the 
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is from zermillion. 
This estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available 
to Synovus, and the actual losses could prove to be higher. As there are 
further developments in these legal matters, Synovus will continually 
reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably possible 
losses may change as a result of this assessment. Based on our current 
knowledge and advice of counsel, management presently does not believe 
that the liabilities arising from these legal matters will have a material adverse 
effect on Synovus’ consolidated ﬁ nancial condition, operating results or 
cash ﬂ ows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these 
legal matters could have a material adverse effect on Synovus’ results of 
operations and ﬁ nancial condition for any particular period.
Synovus intends to vigorously pursue all available defenses to these legal 
matters, but will also consider other alternatives, including settlement, in 
situations where there is an opportunity to resolve such legal matters on 
terms that Synovus considers to be favorable, including in light of the 
continued expense and distraction of defending such legal matters. Synovus 
also maintains insurance coverage, which may (or may not) be available to cover legal fees, or potential losses that might be incurred in connection 
with the legal matters described below. The above-noted estimated range 
of reasonably possible losses does not take into consideration insurance 
coverage which may or may not be available for the respective legal matters.
CompuCredit Litigation
CB&T, a division of Synovus Bank, a wholly-owned banking subsidiary 
of Synovus, and CompuCredit Corporation (“CompuCredit”) previously 
were parties to an afﬁ nity agreement (“Afﬁ nity Agreement”) pursuant to 
which CB&T issued credit cards that were marketed and serviced by 
CompuCr2008, a putative class action lawsuit was 
ﬁ led against CompuCrStates District Court 
for the Northern District of California, Greenwood v. CompuCredit, et. al., 
4:08-cv-04878 (CW) (“Greenwood”), alleging that one of the 
credit card programs offered pursuant to the Afﬁ nity Agreement violated 
the Credit Repair Organization Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1679 (“CROA Claims”) 
and the California Unfair Competition Law& Prof. Code § 
17200 (“California UCL Claims”). CB&T intends to vigorously defend itself 
2009, the Georgia Superior 
Court in separate litigation between CB&T and CompuCredit ruled that 
CompuCredit must pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by CB&T 
in connection with the Greenwood case pursuant to the indemniﬁ cation 
provision of the Afﬁ nity Agreement described above. Any losses that CB&T 
incurs in connection with Greenwood are also expected to be subject to 
the indemniﬁ cation provisions of the Afﬁ nity Agreement described above.
States Supreme Court issued its opinion 
reversing the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that had afﬁ rmed 
a denial of the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration of the CROA 
Claims in Greenwood and remanded the case for further proceedings 
consistent with its opinion. As a result, it is expected that the plaintiffs will 
be required to submit their CROA Claims to arbitration on an individual 
basis and that those claims will not proceed as a class action. The 
District Court has certiﬁ ed the California UCL claims as a class action,

There are signiﬁ cant uncertainties involved in any potential class action and 
derivative litigation. In the event the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss the second amended complaint in the Securities Class Action, Synovus may seek to mediate the Securities Class Action and Related Litigation in 
order to determine whether a reasonable settlement can be reached. In the 
event the Securities Class Action is not dismissed or settled, Synovus and the individually named defendants collectively intend to vigorously defend 
themselves against the Securities Class Action and Related Litigation.SEC Informal InquirySynovus has received a letter from the SEC Atlanta regional ofﬁ ce, dated 
2009, informing Synovus that it is conducting an informal 
inquiry “to determine whether any person or entity has violated the federal securities laws.” The SEC has not asserted, nor does management 
believe, that Synovus or any person or entity has committed any securities 
violations. Synovus intends to cooperate fully with the SEC’s informal 
inquiry. Based upon information that presently is available to it, Synovus’ 
management is unable to predict the outcome of the informal SEC inquiry 
and cannot currently reasonably determine the probability of a material 
adverse result, if any.

intention to grant Synovus Bank’s request for a certiﬁ cate of immediate

Appeals for a discretionary appeal of the denial of the motion to dismiss.
Employment Expenses and Beneﬁ
 t PlansSynovus has three separate non-contributory retirement and beneﬁ t plans 
consisting of money purchase pension, proﬁ t sharing, and 401(k) plans which 
cover all eligible employees. Annual discretionary contributions to these plans 
are set each year by the Boards of Directors but cannot exceed amounts 
allowable as a deduction for federal income tax purposes. For the year ended 
2011, Synovus will make an aggregate contribution for eligible 
employees to the money purchase pension plan of 3.0%. Synovus made 
an aggregate contribution for eligible employees to the money purchase 
2010 and 3.8% 
2009. The expense recorded for the 
2010, and 2009 was approximately 
million, respectively. For the years 
2010, and 2009, Synovus did not make 
contributions to the proﬁ t sharing and 401(k) plans.
Synovus has stock purchase plans for directors and employees whereby 
Synovus makes contributions equal to one-half of employee and director 
voluntary contributions, subject to certain maximum contribution limitations.

Synovus has entered into salary continuation agreements with certain 
employees for past and future services which provide for current 
compensation in addition to salary in the form of deferred compensation 
payable at retirement or in the event of death, total disability, or termination 
of employment. The aggregate cost of these salary continuation plans 
and associated agreements is not material to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.2010, management amended the Synovus Retiree Medical 
Plan (the Retiree Medical Plan or the Plan). Under the provisions of the 
Retiree Medical Plan, employees who terminated employment after 
becoming eligible for early retirement (attaining age 50 with 15 or more 
years of service) could elect medical coverage for themselves and their eligible dependents. This coverage may continue until the former employee 
(or his spouse) reaches age 65 or cover eligible dependents in accordance 
with the Plan’s provision. Per the amendment, Synovus eliminated the 
post-retirement medical plan coverage for all employees who retired on 
or after Mar2011. Participants who were already receiving beneﬁ ts 
under the Retiree Medical Plan will continue to receive beneﬁ ts under the 
2011, the Retiree Medical Plan had 121 participants.
The amendment was considered a “curtailment event” under ASC 715 
because it eliminated the accrual of deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts for all of the future 
services of a signiﬁ cant number of active employees. At the time of the 
Plan amendment, Synovus estimated the number of eligible participants that would elect coverage by the speciﬁ ed deadline of Mar2011 
ecognized during 
2010. Based on the actual number of retirees who elected medical 
coverage for themselves and/or their eligible dependents, the actual

e-based Compensation
General Description of Share-based Plans
Synovus has a long-term incentive plan under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to grant share-
based awar
shares of its authorized but unissued common 
stock reserved for future grants under the 2007 Omnibus Plan. The Plan 
permits grants of share-based compensation including stock options, 
non-vested shares, and restricted share units. The grants generally include 
vesting periods ranging from two to ﬁ ve years and contractual terms of ten 
years. Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the fair 
market value of a share of common stock on the grant-date. Non-vested 
shares and restricted share units are awarded at no cost to the recipient 
upon their grant. Synovus has historically issued new shares to satisfy 
share option exercises and share unit conversions. Dividend equivalents 
are paid on outstanding restricted share units in the form of additional 
restricted share units that vest over the same vesting period as the original 
restricted share unit grant.
During 2011, Synovus granted 3,815,942 restricted share units to key 
employees throughout the Synovus organization. The majority of the 
awards contain a service-based vesting period of two years. In addition 
to the service vesting requirement, the vesting of certain awards made to 
executives and certain other senior management is contingent upon the repayment of its Series A Preferred Stock and achievement of proﬁ tability 
vesting requirements. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 
awarded restricted share units was $2.65 per share. During 2010, Synovus 
granted 3,442,586 stock options with an exercise price of $2.80 to key 
employees across the Synovus organization. These stock options have 
a three year vesting schedule with one-half of the total grant vesting after 
two years of service and the remaining one-half vesting after three years 
of service. During 2010, Synovus also granted 844,205 restricted share 
units to senior management. In addition to a service vesting requirement, 
the vesting of the restricted share units made to senior management 
is contingent upon the repayment of its Series A Preferred Stock and 
achievement of certain proﬁ tability requirements. Due to multiple vesting 
requirements of certain awards, the date Synovus expects all vesting 
criteria to be met is periodically reviewed to ensure expense for the 
restricted share units granted in 2011 and 2010 is amortized over the 
appropriate time period. The restricted share units granted in 2011 and 
2010 do not include provisions for accelerated vesting upon retirement. 
No share-based incentive awards were granted during 2009 with the 
exception of two insigniﬁ cant grants made under employment agreements 
to non-executive employees.Share-based Compensation Expense
Synovus’ share-based compensation costs are recorded as a component 
of salaries and other personnel expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Share-based compensation expense for service-based 
awards is recognized net of estimated forfeitures for plan participants on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period until reaching retirement eligibility. Total share-based compensation expense 
2010, and 2009, 
respectively. The total income tax beneﬁ t recognized in the consolidated 
statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements 
was apprmillion for 2010 and 2009, 
respectively. No share-based compensation costs have been capitalized

Total net deferred tax assets, before the valuation allowance, were

and 2009, respectively. Additions to the valuation allowance during the

espectively.
A signiﬁ cant portion of the deferred tax asset balance relates to federal and 
state net operating loss carryforwards as well as certain tax credits which 
will be available to reduce its income tax liability in future years. The total 
amount of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding 
2011 arbillion, respectively. 
These net operating losses expire in annual installments beginning in 
2018 through 2032. Tax credits include an alternative minimum tax 
crmillion which has an unlimited carryforward period. Other 
federal and state tax crmillion and 
million, respectively, and have various expiration periods through the 
year 2021. The remaining net deferred tax asset balance was generated 
from temporary differences of which the majority relates to the provision 
for loan losses and depreciation of ﬁ xed assets. This component does 
not have a set expiration date as the temporary differences have not yet 
reduced taxable income. Synovus currently expects that approximately 
million of its net deferred tax assets will expire before they can be 
realized. The majority of these DTAs relate to state income tax credits that 
have various expiration dates through the tax year 2016.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Synovus considered all 
available evidence about the realization of DTAs, both positive and negative, 
that could be objectively veriﬁ ed. Synovus’ positive evidence considered 
in support of its use of forecasted future earnings as a source of realizing 
DTAs was insufﬁ cient to overcome the negative evidence associated with 
its pr2011, management 
concluded that it is mormillion of its deferred 
tax assets will be realized. This amount of deferred tax assets is based 
on actual separate entity state income tax liabilities and tax planning 
strategies. Synovus expects to reverse substantially all (or approximately 
million of the currmillion) of the valuation 
allowance once it has demonstrated a sustainable return to proﬁ tability. 
While reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable 
judgment, this event could occur at the point Synovus has signiﬁ cantly 
improved its credit quality and experienced consecutive proﬁ table quarters 
coupled with a forecast of sufﬁ cient continuing proﬁ tability. This reversal 
could occur as a single event or over a period of time, depending upon the level of forecasted taxable income, the degree of probability related to 
realizing the forecasted taxable income, and the estimated risk related to 
credit quality. Until such event occurs, Synovus expects to record minimal 
to no tax expense when reporting income before taxes as reductions to 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recognized offsetting 
current tax expense.
Synovus’ income tax returns are subject to review and examination 
by federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions. Currently, no years for 
which Synovus ﬁ led a federal income tax return are under examination 
by the IRS; however, there are certain state tax examinations currently in 
progress. With few exceptions, Synovus is no longer subject to income 
tax examinations from state and local income tax authorities for years 
before 2007. Although Synovus is unable to determine the ultimate 
outcome of these examinations, Synovus believes that current income tax 
accruals are adequate for any uncertain income tax positions relating to 
these examinations. Adjustments to income tax accruals are made when 
necessary to reﬂ ect a change in the probability outcome.

tax positions will be either settled or resolved during the next year.

We have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by 
this Annual Report as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, as amended. This evaluation was carried out under the 
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive ofﬁ cer (“CEO”) and chief ﬁ nancial ofﬁ cer (“CFO”). Based on 
this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting 
them to material information relating to us (including our consolidated 
subsidiaries) and required to be included in our reports ﬁ led with the SEC 
under the Exchange Act.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

effective internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting for Synovus Financial

2011 based on the framework in “Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our 
internal control over ﬁ nancial reporting is ef2011.
